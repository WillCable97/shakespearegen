?

GREMIO:
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.

BAPTI[SEQ_SPLITTER]STA:
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
God save you, [SEQ_SPLITTER]gentlemen!

PETRUCHIO:
And you, good sir! Pray, ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve you not a daughter
Call'd Katharina, fair and v[SEQ_SPLITTER]irtuous?

BAPTISTA:
I have a daughter, sir, called[SEQ_SPLITTER] Katharina.

GREMIO:
You are too blunt: go to it o[SEQ_SPLITTER]rderly.

PETRUCHIO:
You wrong me, Signior Gremio: [SEQ_SPLITTER]give me leave.
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Her affabil[SEQ_SPLITTER]ity and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous qualities an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d mild behavior,
Am bold to show myself a forward [SEQ_SPLITTER]guest
Within your house, to make mine eye the witn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
And,[SEQ_SPLITTER] for an entrance to my entertainment,
I do present[SEQ_SPLITTER] you with a man of mine,
Cunning in music and the [SEQ_SPLITTER]mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those scienc[SEQ_SPLITTER]es,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
Accept of [SEQ_SPLITTER]him, or else you do me wrong:
His name is Licio, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]orn in Mantua.

BAPTISTA:
You're welcome, sir; and[SEQ_SPLITTER] he, for your good sake.
But for my daughter Katha[SEQ_SPLITTER]rina, this I know,
She is not for your turn, the m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore my grief.

PETRUCHIO:
I see you do not mean to[SEQ_SPLITTER] part with her,
Or else you like not of my company[SEQ_SPLITTER].

BAPTISTA:
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
PETRUCHIO:
Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER] man well known throughout all Italy.

BAPTISTA:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] know him well: you are welcome for his sake.

GRE[SEQ_SPLITTER]MIO:
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Let us, [SEQ_SPLITTER]that are poor petitioners, speak too:
Baccare! you[SEQ_SPLITTER] are marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
O, pardon me,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.

GREMIO:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
wooing[SEQ_SPLITTER]. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
su[SEQ_SPLITTER]re of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at have been more kindly beholding to you than
any[SEQ_SPLITTER], freely give unto you this young scholar,
that ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th been long studying at Rheims; as cunning
in Gre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
in mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]sic and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
acc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ept his service.

BAPTISTA:
A thousand thanks, Sig[SEQ_SPLITTER]nior Gremio.
Welcome, good Cambio.
But, gentle sir[SEQ_SPLITTER], methinks you walk like a stranger:
may I be so b[SEQ_SPLITTER]old to know the cause of your coming?

TRANIO:
Par[SEQ_SPLITTER]don me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
That, being[SEQ_SPLITTER] a stranger in this city here,
Do make myself a su[SEQ_SPLITTER]itor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
In th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e preferment of the eldest sister.
This liberty is[SEQ_SPLITTER] all that I request,
That, upon knowledge of my pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that [SEQ_SPLITTER]woo
And free access and favour as the rest:
And, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]oward the education of your daughters,
I here best[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow a simple instrument,
And this small packet of G[SEQ_SPLITTER]reek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then the[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir worth is great.

BAPTISTA:
Lucentio is your nam[SEQ_SPLITTER]e; of whence, I pray?

TRANIO:
Of Pisa, sir; son t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o Vincentio.

BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of Pisa; by r[SEQ_SPLITTER]eport
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
To my daughters; and [SEQ_SPLITTER]tell them both,
These are their tutors: bid them u[SEQ_SPLITTER]se them well.
We will go walk a little in the orch[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard,
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And so I pray you all to think yourselves.

PETRUC[SEQ_SPLITTER]HIO:
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew my fat[SEQ_SPLITTER]her well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is lands and goods,
Which I have better'd rather t[SEQ_SPLITTER]han decreased:
Then tell me, if I get your daughte[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's love,
What dowry shall I have with her to wife[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

BAPTISTA:
After my death the one half of my lan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds,
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.

PET[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUCHIO:
And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
He[SEQ_SPLITTER]r widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In all my [SEQ_SPLITTER]lands and leases whatsoever:
Let specialties be th[SEQ_SPLITTER]erefore drawn between us,
That covenants may be ke[SEQ_SPLITTER]pt on either hand.

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the special[SEQ_SPLITTER] thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at is all in all.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, that is nothing[SEQ_SPLITTER]: for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptory as sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]e proud-minded;
And where two raging fires meet to[SEQ_SPLITTER]gether
They do consume the thing that feeds their [SEQ_SPLITTER]fury:
Though little fire grows great with little w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
So I to her and so she yields to me;
For I am rou[SEQ_SPLITTER]gh and woo not like a babe.

BAPTISTA:
Well mayst [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
But be thou arm'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d for some unhappy words.

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, to the p[SEQ_SPLITTER]roof; as mountains are for winds,
That shake not, [SEQ_SPLITTER]though they blow perpetually.

BAPTISTA:
How now, [SEQ_SPLITTER]my friend! why dost thou look so pale?

HORTENSIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

BAPTIST[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]HORTENSIO:
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]ron may hold with her, but never lutes.

BAPTISTA:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]HORTENSIO:
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to[SEQ_SPLITTER] me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
When, with[SEQ_SPLITTER] a most impatient devilish spirit,
'Frets, call yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
with them:'
And, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith that word, she struck me on the head,
And thro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ugh the instrument my pate made way;
And there I s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tood amazed for a while,
As on a pillory, looking [SEQ_SPLITTER]through the lute;
While she did call me rascal fid[SEQ_SPLITTER]dler
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile ter[SEQ_SPLITTER]ms,
As had she studied to misuse me so.

PETRUCHIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
I love h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er ten times more than e'er I did:
O, how I long t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o have some chat with her!

BAPTISTA:
Well, go wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h me and be not so discomfited:
Proceed in practis[SEQ_SPLITTER]e with my younger daughter;
She's apt to learn and[SEQ_SPLITTER] thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will [SEQ_SPLITTER]you go with us,
Or shall I send my daughter Kate t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o you?

PETRUCHIO:
I pray you do.
I will attend he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r here,
And woo her with some spirit when she come[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain[SEQ_SPLITTER]
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Say that s[SEQ_SPLITTER]he frown, I'll say she looks as clear
As morning r[SEQ_SPLITTER]oses newly wash'd with dew:
Say she be mute and wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll not speak a word;
Then I'll commend her volubil[SEQ_SPLITTER]ity,
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
If s[SEQ_SPLITTER]he do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
As though[SEQ_SPLITTER] she bid me stay by her a week:
If she deny to wed[SEQ_SPLITTER], I'll crave the day
When I shall ask the banns an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d when be married.
But here she comes; and now, Pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]truchio, speak.
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your[SEQ_SPLITTER] name, I hear.

KATHARINA:
Well have you heard, bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t something hard of hearing:
They call me Katharin[SEQ_SPLITTER]a that do talk of me.

PETRUCHIO:
You lie, in fait[SEQ_SPLITTER]h; for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd sometimes Kate the curst;
But Kate, the prettie[SEQ_SPLITTER]st Kate in Christendom
Kate of Kate Hall, my super[SEQ_SPLITTER]-dainty Kate,
For dainties are all Kates, and ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]efore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my consolati[SEQ_SPLITTER]on;
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Yet no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am moved to[SEQ_SPLITTER] woo thee for my wife.

KATHARINA:
Moved! in good [SEQ_SPLITTER]time: let him that moved you hither
Remove you hen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce: I knew you at the first
You were a moveable.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]PETRUCHIO:
Why, what's a moveable?

KATHARINA:
A j[SEQ_SPLITTER]oin'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast hit it: come, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]it on me.

KATHARINA:
Asses are made to bear, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]so are you.

PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to bear, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d so are you.

KATHARINA:
No such jade as you, if [SEQ_SPLITTER]me you mean.

PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I will n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be but young [SEQ_SPLITTER]and light--

KATHARINA:
Too light for such a swain[SEQ_SPLITTER] as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould be.

PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should--buzz!

KAT[SEQ_SPLITTER]HARINA:
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KATHARINA:
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzza[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u are too angry.

KATHARINA:
If I be waspish, best[SEQ_SPLITTER] beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO:
My remedy is then, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o pluck it out.

KATHARINA:
Ay, if the fool could [SEQ_SPLITTER]find it where it lies,

PETRUCHIO:
Who knows not w[SEQ_SPLITTER]here a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.

KAT[SEQ_SPLITTER]HARINA:
In his tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
Whose tongue?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KATHARINA:
Yours, if you talk of tails: and so far[SEQ_SPLITTER]ewell.

PETRUCHIO:
What, with my tongue in your ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]il? nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
KATHARINA:
That I'll try.

PETRUCHIO:
I swear I'l[SEQ_SPLITTER]l cuff you, if you strike again.

KATHARINA:
So ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y you lose your arms:
If you strike me, you are no[SEQ_SPLITTER] gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PETRUCHIO:
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy book[SEQ_SPLITTER]s!

KATHARINA:
What is your crest? a coxcomb?

PET[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KATHARINA:
No cock of mine; you crow too like a cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]aven.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, come, Kate, come; you must [SEQ_SPLITTER]not look so sour.

KATHARINA:
It is my fashion, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]en I see a crab.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, here's no crab; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and therefore look not sour.

KATHARINA:
There is,[SEQ_SPLITTER] there is.

PETRUCHIO:
Then show it me.

KATHARINA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Had I a glass, I would.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you me[SEQ_SPLITTER]an my face?

KATHARINA:
Well aim'd of such a young[SEQ_SPLITTER] one.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint George, I am too y[SEQ_SPLITTER]oung for you.

KATHARINA:
Yet you are wither'd.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ETRUCHIO:
'Tis with cares.

KATHARINA:
I care not.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you sca[SEQ_SPLITTER]pe not so.

KATHARINA:
I chafe you, if I tarry: le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t me go.

PETRUCHIO:
No, not a whit: I find you pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssing gentle.
'Twas told me you were rough and coy[SEQ_SPLITTER] and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar;
Fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowe[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs:
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look aska[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor [SEQ_SPLITTER]hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
But thou w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
With gentle [SEQ_SPLITTER]conference, soft and affable.
Why does the world r[SEQ_SPLITTER]eport that Kate doth limp?
O slanderous world! Kat[SEQ_SPLITTER]e like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender and [SEQ_SPLITTER]as brown in hue
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the[SEQ_SPLITTER] kernels.
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not h[SEQ_SPLITTER]alt.

KATHARINA:
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ommand.

PETRUCHIO:
Did ever Dian so become a grov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O, [SEQ_SPLITTER]be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
And then let Ka[SEQ_SPLITTER]te be chaste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA:
Where [SEQ_SPLITTER]did you study all this goodly speech?

PETRUCHIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]It is extempore, from my mother-wit.

KATHARINA:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER] witty mother! witless else her son.

PETRUCHIO:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]m I not wise?

KATHARINA:
Yes; keep you warm.

PET[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUCHIO:
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy [SEQ_SPLITTER]bed:
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hus in plain terms: your father hath consented
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I am a husband for your turn;
For, by this light, [SEQ_SPLITTER]whereby I see thy beauty,
Thy beauty, that doth ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke me like thee well,
Thou must be married to no m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an but me;
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformabl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e as other household Kates.
Here comes your father[SEQ_SPLITTER]: never make denial;
I must and will have Katharin[SEQ_SPLITTER]a to my wife.

BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Petruchio, h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow speed you with my daughter?

PETRUCHIO:
How but[SEQ_SPLITTER] well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible I sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld speed amiss.

BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, daughter[SEQ_SPLITTER] Katharina! in your dumps?

KATHARINA:
Call you me[SEQ_SPLITTER] daughter? now, I promise you
You have show'd a te[SEQ_SPLITTER]nder fatherly regard,
To wish me wed to one half l[SEQ_SPLITTER]unatic;
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

PETRU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CHIO:
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the worl[SEQ_SPLITTER]d,
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]f she be curst, it is for policy,
For she's not fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]oward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, but[SEQ_SPLITTER] temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chas[SEQ_SPLITTER]tity:
And to conclude, we have 'greed so well toge[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

KATHAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]INA:
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

GREMIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
hang'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] first.

TRANIO:
Is this your speeding? nay, then,[SEQ_SPLITTER] good night our part!

PETRUCHIO:
Be patient, gent[SEQ_SPLITTER]lemen; I choose her for myself:
If she and I be pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]eased, what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt u[SEQ_SPLITTER]s twain, being alone,
That she shall still be curs[SEQ_SPLITTER]t in company.
I tell you, 'tis incredible to belie[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
She[SEQ_SPLITTER] hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
She vied so [SEQ_SPLITTER]fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twink she[SEQ_SPLITTER] won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'tis a wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rld to see,
How tame, when men and women are alone[SEQ_SPLITTER],
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Gi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
To buy a[SEQ_SPLITTER]pparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast,[SEQ_SPLITTER] father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Kat[SEQ_SPLITTER]harina shall be fine.

BAPTISTA:
I know not what t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o say: but give me your hands;
God send you joy, P[SEQ_SPLITTER]etruchio! 'tis a match.

GREMIO:
Amen, say we: we [SEQ_SPLITTER]will be witnesses.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, and wife, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd gentlemen, adieu;
I will to Venice; Sunday come[SEQ_SPLITTER]s apace:
We will have rings and things and fine ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]ray;
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunda[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.

GREMIO:
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

BAPTISTA:
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchan[SEQ_SPLITTER]t's part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]TRANIO:
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
'Tw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

BAPTIS[SEQ_SPLITTER]TA:
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.

GREMI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
But now[SEQ_SPLITTER], Baptists, to your younger daughter:
Now is the d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay we long have looked for:
I am your neighbour, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd was suitor first.

TRANIO:
And I am one that lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve Bianca more
Than words can witness, or your tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ughts can guess.

GREMIO:
Youngling, thou canst no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t love so dear as I.

TRANIO:
Graybeard, thy love [SEQ_SPLITTER]doth freeze.

GREMIO:
But thine doth fry.
Skipper,[SEQ_SPLITTER] stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.

TRANIO:
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

BAPTIST[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this st[SEQ_SPLITTER]rife:
'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of bot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall[SEQ_SPLITTER] have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, What [SEQ_SPLITTER]can you assure her?

GREMIO:
First, as you know, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y house within the city
Is richly furnished with p[SEQ_SPLITTER]late and gold;
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty[SEQ_SPLITTER] hands;
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
In ivo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress ch[SEQ_SPLITTER]ests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, tents[SEQ_SPLITTER], and canopies,
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] with pearl,
Valance of Venice gold in needlework,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Pewter and brass and all things that belong
To ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]use or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hun[SEQ_SPLITTER]dred milch-kine to the pail,
Sixscore fat oxen sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]nding in my stalls,
And all things answerable to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his portion.
Myself am struck in years, I must con[SEQ_SPLITTER]fess;
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
If whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]lst I live she will be only mine.

TRANIO:
That 'o[SEQ_SPLITTER]nly' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s heir and only son:
If I may have your daughter [SEQ_SPLITTER]to my wife,
I'll leave her houses three or four as[SEQ_SPLITTER] good,
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
Old Sign[SEQ_SPLITTER]ior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand duca[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior [SEQ_SPLITTER]Gremio?

GREMIO:
Two thousand ducats by the year o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f land!
My land amounts not to so much in all:
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t she shall have; besides an argosy
That now is ly[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing in Marseilles' road.
What, have I choked you w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith an argosy?

TRANIO:
Gremio, 'tis known my fath[SEQ_SPLITTER]er hath no less
Than three great argosies; besides[SEQ_SPLITTER] two galliases,
And twelve tight galleys: these I [SEQ_SPLITTER]will assure her,
And twice as much, whate'er thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]offer'st next.

GREMIO:
Nay, I have offer'd all, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have no more;
And she can have no more than all I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have:
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

TRANIO:
Why, then the maid is mine from all the [SEQ_SPLITTER]world,
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]BAPTISTA:
I must confess your offer is the best;
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, let your father make her the assurance,
She is[SEQ_SPLITTER] your own; else, you must pardon me,
if you should[SEQ_SPLITTER] die before him, where's her dower?

TRANIO:
That'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s but a cavil: he is old, I young.

GREMIO:
And ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y not young men die, as well as old?

BAPTISTA:
We[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll, gentlemen,
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next [SEQ_SPLITTER]you know
My daughter Katharina is to be married:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Be bride[SEQ_SPLITTER] to you, if you this assurance;
If not, Signior Gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]emio:
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

GREMIO:
Adieu, good neighbour.
Now I fear thee n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot:
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To give thee all, and in his waning age
Set foot [SEQ_SPLITTER]under thy table: tut, a toy!
An old Italian fox is[SEQ_SPLITTER] not so kind, my boy.

TRANIO:
A vengeance on your[SEQ_SPLITTER] crafty wither'd hide!
Yet I have faced it with a [SEQ_SPLITTER]card of ten.
'Tis in my head to do my master good:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
Must get a [SEQ_SPLITTER]father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
And that's a [SEQ_SPLITTER]wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their children; bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t in this case of wooing,
A child shall get a sire[SEQ_SPLITTER], if I fail not of my cunning.

LUCENTIO:
Fiddler,[SEQ_SPLITTER] forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
Have you so s[SEQ_SPLITTER]oon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katharina [SEQ_SPLITTER]welcomed you withal?

HORTENSIO:
But, wrangling pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]dant, this is
The patroness of heavenly harmony:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen give me leave to have prerogative;
And when in[SEQ_SPLITTER] music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture shall h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave leisure for as much.

LUCENTIO:
Preposterous a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss, that never read so far
To know the cause why m[SEQ_SPLITTER]usic was ordain'd!
Was it not to refresh the mind [SEQ_SPLITTER]of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause[SEQ_SPLITTER], serve in your harmony.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, I wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l not bear these braves of thine.

BIANCA:
Why, ge[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntlemen, you do me double wrong,
To strive for tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t which resteth in my choice:
I am no breeching sc[SEQ_SPLITTER]holar in the schools;
I'll not be tied to hours no[SEQ_SPLITTER]r 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please[SEQ_SPLITTER] myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we d[SEQ_SPLITTER]own:
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles[SEQ_SPLITTER];
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

HO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RTENSIO:
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tun[SEQ_SPLITTER]e?

LUCENTIO:
That will be never: tune your instru[SEQ_SPLITTER]ment.

BIANCA:
Where left we last?

LUCENTIO:
Here[SEQ_SPLITTER], madam:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
C[SEQ_SPLITTER]onstrue them.

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat,' as I told you[SEQ_SPLITTER] before, 'Simois,' I am
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nto Vincentio of Pisa,
'Sigeia tellus,' disguised [SEQ_SPLITTER]thus to get your love;
'Hic steterat,' and that Lu[SEQ_SPLITTER]centio that comes
a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]anio, 'regia,'
bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t we might
beguile the old pantaloon.

HORTENSIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Madam, my instrument's in tune.

BIANCA:
Let's hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r. O fie! the treble jars.

LUCENTIO:
Spit in the [SEQ_SPLITTER]hole, man, and tune again.

BIANCA:
Now let me see[SEQ_SPLITTER] if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Simois,' I know y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
trust you not; [SEQ_SPLITTER]'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
he hear us not, '[SEQ_SPLITTER]regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
despair not.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]HORTENSIO:
Madam, 'tis now in tune.

LUCENTIO:
All[SEQ_SPLITTER] but the base.

HORTENSIO:
The base is right; 'tis[SEQ_SPLITTER] the base knave that jars.
How fiery and forward o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur pedant is!
Now, for my life, the knave doth cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt my love:
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BIANCA:
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

L[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCENTIO:
Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
Was [SEQ_SPLITTER]Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.

BIANCA:
I m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust believe my master; else, I promise you,
I shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld be arguing still upon that doubt:
But let it re[SEQ_SPLITTER]st. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters, take it not [SEQ_SPLITTER]unkindly, pray,
That I have been thus pleasant wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h you both.

HORTENSIO:
You may go walk, and give [SEQ_SPLITTER]me leave a while:
My lessons make no music in thre[SEQ_SPLITTER]e parts.

LUCENTIO:
Are you so formal, sir? well, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I must wait,
And watch withal; for, but I be decei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ved,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.

HORTENSIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Madam, before you touch the instrument,
To learn[SEQ_SPLITTER] the order of my fingering,
I must begin with rudi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ments of art;
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort[SEQ_SPLITTER],
More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
Than hath be[SEQ_SPLITTER]en taught by any of my trade:
And there it is in w[SEQ_SPLITTER]riting, fairly drawn.

BIANCA:
Why, I am past my g[SEQ_SPLITTER]amut long ago.

HORTENSIO:
Yet read the gamut of H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ortensio.

BIANCA:

Servant:
Mistress, your father[SEQ_SPLITTER] prays you leave your books
And help to dress your[SEQ_SPLITTER] sister's chamber up:
You know to-morrow is the we[SEQ_SPLITTER]dding-day.

BIANCA:
Farewell, sweet masters both; [SEQ_SPLITTER]I must be gone.

LUCENTIO:
Faith, mistress, then I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have no cause to stay.

HORTENSIO:
But I have cau[SEQ_SPLITTER]se to pry into this pedant:
Methinks he looks as t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hough he were in love:
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca[SEQ_SPLITTER], be so humble
To cast thy wandering eyes on every[SEQ_SPLITTER] stale,
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee [SEQ_SPLITTER]ranging,
Hortensio will be quit with thee by chang[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing.

BAPTISTA:

KATHARINA:
No shame but mine: I m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust, forsooth, be forced
To give my hand opposed a[SEQ_SPLITTER]gainst my heart
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of s[SEQ_SPLITTER]pleen;
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leis[SEQ_SPLITTER]ure.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
Hiding [SEQ_SPLITTER]his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
And, to be not[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed for a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand, 'point t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he day of marriage,
Make feasts, invite friends, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wed wher[SEQ_SPLITTER]e he hath woo'd.
Now must the world point at poor [SEQ_SPLITTER]Katharina,
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's [SEQ_SPLITTER]wife,
If it would please him come and marry her!'
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
TRANIO:
Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista to[SEQ_SPLITTER]o.
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
Whateve[SEQ_SPLITTER]r fortune stays him from his word:
Though he be bl[SEQ_SPLITTER]unt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, [SEQ_SPLITTER]yet withal he's honest.

KATHARINA:
Would Katharin[SEQ_SPLITTER]a had never seen him though!

BAPTISTA:
Go, girl; [SEQ_SPLITTER]I cannot blame thee now to weep;
For such an injur[SEQ_SPLITTER]y would vex a very saint,
Much more a shrew of thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] impatient humour.

BIONDELLO:
Master, master! new[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, old news, and such news as
you never heard of!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BAPTISTA:
Is it new and old too? how may that be?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

BIONDELLO:
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petru[SEQ_SPLITTER]chio's coming?

BAPTISTA:
Is he come?

BIONDELLO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Why, no, sir.

BAPTISTA:
What then?

BIONDELLO:
He[SEQ_SPLITTER] is coming.

BAPTISTA:
When will he be here?

BION[SEQ_SPLITTER]DELLO:
When he stands where I am and sees you ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

TRANIO:
But say, what to thine old news?

BION[SEQ_SPLITTER]DELLO:
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and a[SEQ_SPLITTER]n old
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned[SEQ_SPLITTER], a pair
of boots that have been candle-cases, one[SEQ_SPLITTER] buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en [SEQ_SPLITTER]out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and ch[SEQ_SPLITTER]apeless;
with two broken points: his horse hipped [SEQ_SPLITTER]with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindre[SEQ_SPLITTER]d;
besides, possessed with the glanders and like t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o mose
in the chine; troubled with the lampass, in[SEQ_SPLITTER]fected
with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped [SEQ_SPLITTER]with
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the[SEQ_SPLITTER] fives,
stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith the
bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shot[SEQ_SPLITTER]ten;
near-legged before and with, a half-chequed b[SEQ_SPLITTER]it
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being[SEQ_SPLITTER]
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
[SEQ_SPLITTER]often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth[SEQ_SPLITTER]
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]which hath two letters for her name fairly set dow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
in studs, and here and there pieced with packthr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ead.

BAPTISTA:
Who comes with him?

BIONDELLO:
O,[SEQ_SPLITTER] sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
[SEQ_SPLITTER]kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red[SEQ_SPLITTER]
and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of fort[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, [SEQ_SPLITTER]a
very monster in apparel, and not like a Christia[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.

TRANIO:
'Tis s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oft[SEQ_SPLITTER]entimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.

BAPTISTA:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.

BIONDELLO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Why, sir, he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
Didst thou not[SEQ_SPLITTER] say he comes?

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio cam[SEQ_SPLITTER]e?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, that Petruchio came.

BIONDELLO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ack.

BAPTISTA:
Why, that's all one.

BIONDELLO:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you a penny,
A horse and[SEQ_SPLITTER] a man
Is more than one,
And yet not many.

PETRUC[SEQ_SPLITTER]HIO:
Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

BAPTISTA:
You are welcome, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]yet I come not well.

BAPTISTA:
And yet you halt n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot.

TRANIO:
Not so well apparell'd
As I wish you [SEQ_SPLITTER]were.

PETRUCHIO:
Were it better, I should rush in[SEQ_SPLITTER] thus.
But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
As if the[SEQ_SPLITTER]y saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or unusua[SEQ_SPLITTER]l prodigy?

BAPTISTA:
Why, sir, you know this is y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our wedding-day:
First were we sad, fearing you wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld not come;
Now sadder, that you come so unprovi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ded.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]n eye-sore to our solemn festival!

TRANIO:
And te[SEQ_SPLITTER]lls us, what occasion of import
Hath all so long d[SEQ_SPLITTER]etain'd you from your wife,
And sent you hither so[SEQ_SPLITTER] unlike yourself?

PETRUCHIO:
Tedious it were to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am come to kee[SEQ_SPLITTER]p my word,
Though in some part enforced to digress[SEQ_SPLITTER];
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
As you [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate?[SEQ_SPLITTER] I stay too long from her:
The morning wears, 'tis[SEQ_SPLITTER] time we were at church.

TRANIO:
See not your bri[SEQ_SPLITTER]de in these unreverent robes:
Go to my chamber; Pu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t on clothes of mine.

PETRUCHIO:
Not I, believe m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e: thus I'll visit her.

BAPTISTA:
But thus, I tru[SEQ_SPLITTER]st, you will not marry her.

PETRUCHIO:
Good sooth[SEQ_SPLITTER], even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
To me [SEQ_SPLITTER]she's married, not unto my clothes:
Could I repair[SEQ_SPLITTER] what she will wear in me,
As I can change these p[SEQ_SPLITTER]oor accoutrements,
'Twere well for Kate and better[SEQ_SPLITTER] for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat with you[SEQ_SPLITTER],
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
And s[SEQ_SPLITTER]eal the title with a lovely kiss!

TRANIO:
He hath[SEQ_SPLITTER] some meaning in his mad attire:
We will persuade [SEQ_SPLITTER]him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to[SEQ_SPLITTER] church.

BAPTISTA:
I'll after him, and see the ev[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent of this.

TRANIO:
But to her love concerneth u[SEQ_SPLITTER]s to add
Her father's liking: which to bring to pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss,
As I before unparted to your worship,
I am to [SEQ_SPLITTER]get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not much. we[SEQ_SPLITTER]'ll fit him to our turn,--
And he shall be Vincent[SEQ_SPLITTER]io of Pisa;
And make assurance here in Padua
Of gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eater sums than I have promised.
So shall you quie[SEQ_SPLITTER]tly enjoy your hope,
And marry sweet Bianca with c[SEQ_SPLITTER]onsent.

LUCENTIO:
Were it not that my fellow-scho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ol-master
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'[SEQ_SPLITTER]Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
Which[SEQ_SPLITTER] once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'll ke[SEQ_SPLITTER]ep mine own, despite of all the world.

TRANIO:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch our [SEQ_SPLITTER]vantage in this business:
We'll over-reach the gre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for my mas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter's sake, Lucentio.
Signior Gremio, came you fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m the church?

GREMIO:
As willingly as e'er I came[SEQ_SPLITTER] from school.

TRANIO:
And is the bride and brideg[SEQ_SPLITTER]room coming home?

GREMIO:
A bridegroom say you? '[SEQ_SPLITTER]tis a groom indeed,
A grumbling groom, and that th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e girl shall find.

TRANIO:
Curster than she? why,[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'tis impossible.

GREMIO:
Why he's a devil, a dev[SEQ_SPLITTER]il, a very fiend.

TRANIO:
Why, she's a devil, a d[SEQ_SPLITTER]evil, the devil's dam.

GREMIO:
Tut, she's a lamb,[SEQ_SPLITTER] a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you, Sir Lucenti[SEQ_SPLITTER]o: when the priest
Should ask, if Katharina should[SEQ_SPLITTER] be his wife,
'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and s[SEQ_SPLITTER]wore so loud,
That, all-amazed, the priest let fal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l the book;
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up[SEQ_SPLITTER],
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
[SEQ_SPLITTER]That down fell priest and book and book and priest[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'

TR[SEQ_SPLITTER]ANIO:
What said the wench when he rose again?

GRE[SEQ_SPLITTER]MIO:
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and s[SEQ_SPLITTER]wore,
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But afte[SEQ_SPLITTER]r many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: 'A heal[SEQ_SPLITTER]th!' quoth he, as if
He had been aboard, carousing[SEQ_SPLITTER] to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the musca[SEQ_SPLITTER]del
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]aving no other reason
But that his beard grew thin[SEQ_SPLITTER] and hungerly
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was[SEQ_SPLITTER] drinking.
This done, he took the bride about the [SEQ_SPLITTER]neck
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous sma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck
That at the parting all the church did echo:
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d I seeing this came thence for very shame;
And af[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]riage never was before:
Hark, hark! I hear the min[SEQ_SPLITTER]strels play.

PETRUCHIO:
Gentlemen and friends, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]thank you for your pains:
I know you think to dine[SEQ_SPLITTER] with me to-day,
And have prepared great store of [SEQ_SPLITTER]wedding cheer;
But so it is, my haste doth call me[SEQ_SPLITTER] hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave[SEQ_SPLITTER].

BAPTISTA:
Is't possible you will away to-night?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PETRUCHIO:
I must away to-day, before night come[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
You [SEQ_SPLITTER]would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest [SEQ_SPLITTER]company, I thank you all,
That have beheld me give[SEQ_SPLITTER] away myself
To this most patient, sweet and virtu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous wife:
Dine with my father, drink a health to m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e;
For I must hence; and farewell to you all.

TRA[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIO:
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ETRUCHIO:
It may not be.

GREMIO:
Let me entreat y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou.

PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be.

KATHARINA:
Let me e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
I am content.

KATHARINA:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Are you content to stay?

PETRUCHIO:
I am content [SEQ_SPLITTER]you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entre[SEQ_SPLITTER]at me how you can.

KATHARINA:
Now, if you love me[SEQ_SPLITTER], stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Grumio, my horse.

GRUMIO:
Ay,[SEQ_SPLITTER] sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horse[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.

KATHARINA:
Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ease myself.
The door is open, sir; there lies you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots are gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]een;
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] take it on you at the first so roundly.

PETRUCHI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ATHARINA:
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.

GREMIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.

KATARINA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
I see a[SEQ_SPLITTER] woman may be made a fool,
If she had not a spirit[SEQ_SPLITTER] to resist.

PETRUCHIO:
They shall go forward, Kat[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend[SEQ_SPLITTER] on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Caro[SEQ_SPLITTER]use full measure to her maidenhead,
Be mad and mer[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny Kate, [SEQ_SPLITTER]she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, no[SEQ_SPLITTER]r stare, nor fret;
I will be master of what is min[SEQ_SPLITTER]e own:
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my hou[SEQ_SPLITTER]se,
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My hors[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
And here she stand[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring mine action [SEQ_SPLITTER]on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua. Gru[SEQ_SPLITTER]mio,
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thie[SEQ_SPLITTER]ves;
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
Fear n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot, sweet wench, they shall not touch
thee, Kate:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I'll buckler thee against a million.

BAPTISTA:
Na[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

GREMIO:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
TRANIO:
Of all mad matches never was the like.

L[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCENTIO:
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sis[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter?

BIANCA:
That, being mad herself, she's madly[SEQ_SPLITTER] mated.

GREMIO:
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated[SEQ_SPLITTER].

BAPTISTA:
Neighbours and friends, though bride [SEQ_SPLITTER]and
bridegroom wants
For to supply the places at t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he table,
You know there wants no junkets at the f[SEQ_SPLITTER]east.
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's [SEQ_SPLITTER]place:
And let Bianca take her sister's room.

TRA[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIO:
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BAPTISTA:
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, l[SEQ_SPLITTER]et's go.

GRUMIO:
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on [SEQ_SPLITTER]all mad masters, and
all foul ways! Was ever man s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o beaten? was ever
man so rayed? was ever man so w[SEQ_SPLITTER]eary? I am sent
before to make a fire, and they ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e coming after to
warm them. Now, were not I a lit[SEQ_SPLITTER]tle pot and soon
hot, my very lips might freeze to[SEQ_SPLITTER] my teeth, my
tongue to the roof of my mouth, my h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eart in my
belly, ere I should come by a fire to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]haw me: but
I, with blowing the fire, shall warm m[SEQ_SPLITTER]yself; for,
considering the weather, a taller man [SEQ_SPLITTER]than I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.

CURTIS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Who is that calls so coldly?

GRUMIO:
A piece of [SEQ_SPLITTER]ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
from my sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]oulder to my heel with no greater a run
but my hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]d and my neck. A fire good Curtis.

CURTIS:
Is my [SEQ_SPLITTER]master and his wife coming, Grumio?

GRUMIO:
O, ay[SEQ_SPLITTER], Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
on no[SEQ_SPLITTER] water.

CURTIS:
Is she so hot a shrew as she's re[SEQ_SPLITTER]ported?

GRUMIO:
She was, good Curtis, before this[SEQ_SPLITTER] frost: but, thou
knowest, winter tames man, woman[SEQ_SPLITTER] and beast; for it
hath tamed my old master and my[SEQ_SPLITTER] new mistress and
myself, fellow Curtis.

CURTIS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.

GRUMIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd
so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a[SEQ_SPLITTER]
fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress[SEQ_SPLITTER],
whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt so[SEQ_SPLITTER]on
feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y hot office?

CURTIS:
I prithee, good Grumio, tel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l me, how goes the world?

GRUMIO:
A cold world, C[SEQ_SPLITTER]urtis, in every office but thine; and
therefore fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]re: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master [SEQ_SPLITTER]and mistress are almost frozen to death.

CURTIS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e news.

GRUMIO:
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as[SEQ_SPLITTER] much news as
will thaw.

CURTIS:
Come, you are so[SEQ_SPLITTER] full of cony-catching!

GRUMIO:
Why, therefore fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]re; for I have caught extreme cold.
Where's the co[SEQ_SPLITTER]ok? is supper ready, the house
trimmed, rushes str[SEQ_SPLITTER]ewed, cobwebs swept; the
serving-men in their new [SEQ_SPLITTER]fustian, their white
stockings, and every officer [SEQ_SPLITTER]his wedding-garment on?
Be the jacks fair within, [SEQ_SPLITTER]the jills fair without,
the carpets laid, and ever[SEQ_SPLITTER]y thing in order?

CURTIS:
All ready; and therefor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO:
First, know, my hor[SEQ_SPLITTER]se is tired; my master and
mistress fallen out.

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]URTIS:
How?

GRUMIO:
Out of their saddles into the[SEQ_SPLITTER] dirt; and thereby
hangs a tale.

CURTIS:
Let's ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]'t, good Grumio.

GRUMIO:
Lend thine ear.

CURTIS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Here.

GRUMIO:
There.

CURTIS:
This is to feel a [SEQ_SPLITTER]tale, not to hear a tale.

GRUMIO:
And therefore '[SEQ_SPLITTER]tis called a sensible tale: and this
cuff was but [SEQ_SPLITTER]to knock at your ear, and beseech
listening. Now I[SEQ_SPLITTER] begin: Imprimis, we came down a
foul hill, my mas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter riding behind my mistress,--

CURTIS:
Both of [SEQ_SPLITTER]one horse?

GRUMIO:
What's that to thee?

CURTIS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Why, a horse.

GRUMIO:
Tell thou the tale: but had[SEQ_SPLITTER]st thou not crossed me,
thou shouldst have heard h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow her horse fell and she
under her horse; thou sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ouldst have heard in how
miry a place, how she was[SEQ_SPLITTER] bemoiled, how he left her
with the horse upon her[SEQ_SPLITTER], how he beat me because
her horse stumbled, how s[SEQ_SPLITTER]he waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me, how[SEQ_SPLITTER] he swore, how she prayed,
that never prayed befor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, how I cried, how the
horses ran away, how her b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ridle was burst, how I
lost my crupper, with many [SEQ_SPLITTER]things of worthy memory,
which now shall die in ob[SEQ_SPLITTER]livion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

CURTIS:
By this reckoning he is more shrew than [SEQ_SPLITTER]she.

GRUMIO:
Ay; and that thou and the proudest o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f you all shall
find when he comes home. But what [SEQ_SPLITTER]talk I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nich[SEQ_SPLITTER]olas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let t[SEQ_SPLITTER]heir heads be
sleekly combed their blue coats brus[SEQ_SPLITTER]hed and their
garters of an indifferent knit: let [SEQ_SPLITTER]them curtsy
with their left legs and not presume t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o touch a hair
of my master's horse-tail till they[SEQ_SPLITTER] kiss their
hands. Are they all ready?

CURTIS:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey are.

GRUMIO:
Call them forth.

CURTIS:
Do you [SEQ_SPLITTER]hear, ho? you must meet my master to
countenance m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y mistress.

GRUMIO:
Why, she hath a face of her o[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn.

CURTIS:
Who knows not that?

GRUMIO:
Thou, it[SEQ_SPLITTER] seems, that calls for company to
countenance her.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

CURTIS:
I call them forth to credit her.

GRUMIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.

NATHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIEL:
Welcome home, Grumio!

PHILIP:
How now, Grum[SEQ_SPLITTER]io!

JOSEPH:
What, Grumio!

NICHOLAS:
Fellow Grumi[SEQ_SPLITTER]o!

NATHANIEL:
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
Welcome,[SEQ_SPLITTER] you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
you;--a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
companio[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns, is all ready, and all things neat?

NATHANIEL:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
All things is ready. How near is our master?

GRU[SEQ_SPLITTER]MIO:
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore[SEQ_SPLITTER] be
not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master[SEQ_SPLITTER].

PETRUCHIO:
Where be these knaves? What, no man [SEQ_SPLITTER]at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]here is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?

ALL SERVING-M[SEQ_SPLITTER]EN:
Here, here, sir; here, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
Here, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
You logger-h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaded and unpolish'd grooms!
What, no attendance? [SEQ_SPLITTER]no regard? no duty?
Where is the foolish knave I s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent before?

GRUMIO:
Here, sir; as foolish as I wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s before.

PETRUCHIO:
You peasant swain! you whore[SEQ_SPLITTER]son malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me [SEQ_SPLITTER]in the park,
And bring along these rascal knaves w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith thee?

GRUMIO:
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not [SEQ_SPLITTER]fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]i' the heel;
There was no link to colour Peter's h[SEQ_SPLITTER]at,
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g:
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Grego[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry;
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, [SEQ_SPLITTER]as they are, here are they come to meet you.

PETR[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCHIO:
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere is the life that late I led--
Where are those-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
Sound, sound, soun[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, sound!
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, [SEQ_SPLITTER]be merry.
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ins, when?
It was the friar of orders grey,
As he [SEQ_SPLITTER]forth walked on his way:--
Out, you rogue! you plu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck my foot awry:
Take that, and mend the plucking [SEQ_SPLITTER]off the other.
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat, ho!
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou hence,
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted [SEQ_SPLITTER]with.
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some wat[SEQ_SPLITTER]er?
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u whoreson villain! will you let it fall?

KATHARI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NA:
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PETRUCHIO:
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a sto[SEQ_SPLITTER]mach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all I?
What's this? mutton?

First Servant:
Ay.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ETRUCHIO:
Who brought it?

PETER:
I.

PETRUCHIO:
'[SEQ_SPLITTER]Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
What dogs are t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hese! Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you, vil[SEQ_SPLITTER]lains, bring it from the dresser,
And serve it thu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s to me that love it not?
Theretake it to you, tre[SEQ_SPLITTER]nchers, cups, and all;
You heedless joltheads and [SEQ_SPLITTER]unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble? I'll be w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith you straight.

KATHARINA:
I pray you, husband,[SEQ_SPLITTER] be not so disquiet:
The meat was well, if you wer[SEQ_SPLITTER]e so contented.

PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, Kate, 'tw[SEQ_SPLITTER]as burnt and dried away;
And I expressly am forbid[SEQ_SPLITTER] to touch it,
For it engenders choler, planteth an[SEQ_SPLITTER]ger;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]ince, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
Than f[SEQ_SPLITTER]eed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o-morrow 't shall be mended,
And, for this night, [SEQ_SPLITTER]we'll fast for company:
Come, I will bring thee to[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy bridal chamber.

NATHANIEL:
Peter, didst ever[SEQ_SPLITTER] see the like?

PETER:
He kills her in her own hum[SEQ_SPLITTER]our.

GRUMIO:
Where is he?

CURTIS:
In her chamber[SEQ_SPLITTER], making a sermon of continency to her;
And rails,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows[SEQ_SPLITTER] not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
And si[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts as one new-risen from a dream.
Away, away! for [SEQ_SPLITTER]he is coming hither.

PETRUCHIO:
Thus have I polit[SEQ_SPLITTER]icly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end succe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way[SEQ_SPLITTER] I have to man my haggard,
To make her come and kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we[SEQ_SPLITTER] watch these kites
That bate and beat and will not[SEQ_SPLITTER] be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she[SEQ_SPLITTER] shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved faul[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
I'll find about the making of the bed;
And here [SEQ_SPLITTER]I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way[SEQ_SPLITTER] the coverlet, another way the sheets:
Ay, and ami[SEQ_SPLITTER]d this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend[SEQ_SPLITTER] care of her;
And in conclusion she shall watch al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l night:
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and br[SEQ_SPLITTER]awl
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
Thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
And thus [SEQ_SPLITTER]I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
He that k[SEQ_SPLITTER]nows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak[SEQ_SPLITTER]: 'tis charity to show.

TRANIO:
Is't possible, fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any ot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears me fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir in hand.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, to satisfy you in wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t I have said,
Stand by and mark the manner of his[SEQ_SPLITTER] teaching.

LUCENTIO:
Now, mistress, profit you in[SEQ_SPLITTER] what you read?

BIANCA:
What, master, read you? f[SEQ_SPLITTER]irst resolve me that.

LUCENTIO:
I read that I pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]fess, the Art to Love.

BIANCA:
And may you prove,[SEQ_SPLITTER] sir, master of your art!

LUCENTIO:
While you, sw[SEQ_SPLITTER]eet dear, prove mistress of my heart!

HORTENSIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
You[SEQ_SPLITTER] that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
Loved no[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne in the world so well as Lucentio.

TRANIO:
O de[SEQ_SPLITTER]spiteful love! unconstant womankind!
I tell thee, [SEQ_SPLITTER]Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
Mistake no m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I seem to [SEQ_SPLITTER]be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or such a one as leaves a gentleman,
And makes a g[SEQ_SPLITTER]od of such a cullion:
Know, sir, that I am call'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Signior Hortensio, I have ofte[SEQ_SPLITTER]n heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And si[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will[SEQ_SPLITTER] with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca[SEQ_SPLITTER] and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO:
See, how they [SEQ_SPLITTER]kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her no more, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the former[SEQ_SPLITTER] favours
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
TRANIO:
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
Never[SEQ_SPLITTER] to marry with her though she would entreat:
Fie o[SEQ_SPLITTER]n her! see, how beastly she doth court him!

HORTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NSIO:
Would all the world but he had quite forswor[SEQ_SPLITTER]n!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be married to a wealthy widow,
Ere three days pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss, which hath as long loved me
As I have loved th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Sign[SEQ_SPLITTER]ior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteo[SEQ_SPLITTER]us looks,
Shall win my love: and so I take my leav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
In resolution as I swore before.

TRANIO:
Mistr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth [SEQ_SPLITTER]to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have ta'en you n[SEQ_SPLITTER]apping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtensio.

BIANCA:
Tranio, you jest: but have you b[SEQ_SPLITTER]oth forsworn me?

TRANIO:
Mistress, we have.

LUCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
I' faith,[SEQ_SPLITTER] he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be wood [SEQ_SPLITTER]and wedded in a day.

BIANCA:
God give him joy!

T[SEQ_SPLITTER]RANIO:
Ay, and he'll tame her.

BIANCA:
He says so[SEQ_SPLITTER], Tranio.

TRANIO:
Faith, he is gone unto the tami[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng-school.

BIANCA:
The taming-school! what, is th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere such a place?

TRANIO:
Ay, mistress, and Petru[SEQ_SPLITTER]chio is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chatt[SEQ_SPLITTER]ering tongue.

BIONDELLO:
O master, master, I have[SEQ_SPLITTER] watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at last [SEQ_SPLITTER]I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l serve the turn.

TRANIO:
What is he, Biondello?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I k[SEQ_SPLITTER]now not what; but format in apparel,
In gait and c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ountenance surely like a father.

LUCENTIO:
And wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at of him, Tranio?

TRANIO:
If he be credulous and[SEQ_SPLITTER] trust my tale,
I'll make him glad to seem Vincent[SEQ_SPLITTER]io,
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
As if h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e were the right Vincentio
Take in your love, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]then let me alone.

Pedant:
God save you, sir!

TR[SEQ_SPLITTER]ANIO:
And you, sir! you are welcome.
Travel you fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]r on, or are you at the farthest?

Pedant:
Sir, at[SEQ_SPLITTER] the farthest for a week or two:
But then up farth[SEQ_SPLITTER]er, and as for as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God [SEQ_SPLITTER]lend me life.

TRANIO:
What countryman, I pray?

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]edant:
Of Mantua.

TRANIO:
Of Mantua, sir? marry, [SEQ_SPLITTER]God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of your li[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe?

Pedant:
My life, sir! how, I pray? for that g[SEQ_SPLITTER]oes hard.

TRANIO:
'Tis death for any one in Mantu[SEQ_SPLITTER]a
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hips are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
For priva[SEQ_SPLITTER]te quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
Hath publish'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that[SEQ_SPLITTER] you are but newly come,
You might have heard it e[SEQ_SPLITTER]lse proclaim'd about.

Pedant:
Alas! sir, it is wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rse for me than so;
For I have bills for money by [SEQ_SPLITTER]exchange
From Florence and must here deliver them.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

TRANIO:
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will[SEQ_SPLITTER] I do, and this I will advise you:
First, tell me,[SEQ_SPLITTER] have you ever been at Pisa?

Pedant:
Ay, sir, in [SEQ_SPLITTER]Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave ci[SEQ_SPLITTER]tizens.

TRANIO:
Among them know you one Vincentio[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

Pedant:
I know him not, but I have heard of him[SEQ_SPLITTER];
A merchant of incomparable wealth.

TRANIO:
He i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In countenanc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e somewhat doth resemble you.

BIONDELLO:

TRANIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To save your life in this extremity,
This favour [SEQ_SPLITTER]will I do you for his sake;
And think it not the w[SEQ_SPLITTER]orst of an your fortunes
That you are like to Sir [SEQ_SPLITTER]Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake[SEQ_SPLITTER],
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
Lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ok that you take upon you as you should;
You under[SEQ_SPLITTER]stand me, sir: so shall you stay
Till you have don[SEQ_SPLITTER]e your business in the city:
If this be courtesy, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir, accept of it.

Pedant:
O sir, I do; and will [SEQ_SPLITTER]repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

TRANIO:
Then go with me to make the matter good.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
This, by the way, I let you understand;
my father[SEQ_SPLITTER] is here look'd for every day,
To pass assurance o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f a dower in marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's[SEQ_SPLITTER] daughter here:
In all these circumstances I'll in[SEQ_SPLITTER]struct you:
Go with me to clothe you as becomes yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u.

GRUMIO:
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my li[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe.

KATHARINA:
The more my wrong, the more his sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ite appears:
What, did he marry me to famish me?
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]eggars, that come unto my father's door,
Upon entr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaty have a present aims;
If not, elsewhere they m[SEQ_SPLITTER]eet with charity:
But I, who never knew how to ent[SEQ_SPLITTER]reat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
Am s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tarved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
With oat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h kept waking and with brawling fed:
And that whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h spites me more than all these wants,
He does it [SEQ_SPLITTER]under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if [SEQ_SPLITTER]I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or e[SEQ_SPLITTER]lse present death.
I prithee go and get me some re[SEQ_SPLITTER]past;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUMIO:
What say you to a neat's foot?

KATHARINA:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.

GRUM[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
How say you [SEQ_SPLITTER]to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

KATHARINA:
I like [SEQ_SPLITTER]it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.

GRUMIO:
I cann[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
What say you to a p[SEQ_SPLITTER]iece of beef and mustard?

KATHARINA:
A dish that [SEQ_SPLITTER]I do love to feed upon.

GRUMIO:
Ay, but the musta[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd is too hot a little.

KATHARINA:
Why then, the [SEQ_SPLITTER]beef, and let the mustard rest.

GRUMIO:
Nay then,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I will not: you shall have the mustard,
Or else y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA:
Then both, o[SEQ_SPLITTER]r one, or any thing thou wilt.

GRUMIO:
Why then, [SEQ_SPLITTER]the mustard without the beef.

KATHARINA:
Go, get [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
That feed'st[SEQ_SPLITTER] me with the very name of meat:
Sorrow on thee and[SEQ_SPLITTER] all the pack of you,
That triumph thus upon my mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sery!
Go, get thee gone, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
How fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]res my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

HORTENSIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Mistress, what cheer?

KATHARINA:
Faith, as cold[SEQ_SPLITTER] as can be.

PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy spirits; look[SEQ_SPLITTER] cheerfully upon me.
Here love; thou see'st how di[SEQ_SPLITTER]ligent I am
To dress thy meat myself and bring it [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee:
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits [SEQ_SPLITTER]thanks.
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it[SEQ_SPLITTER] not;
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here[SEQ_SPLITTER], take away this dish.

KATHARINA:
I pray you, let[SEQ_SPLITTER] it stand.

PETRUCHIO:
The poorest service is repa[SEQ_SPLITTER]id with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h the meat.

KATHARINA:
I thank you, sir.

HORTENS[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
Come[SEQ_SPLITTER], mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.

PETRUCHIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:

Haberdasher:
Here is the cap your worship did b[SEQ_SPLITTER]espeak.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, this was moulded on a por[SEQ_SPLITTER]ringer;
A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and fil[SEQ_SPLITTER]thy:
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
A knack[SEQ_SPLITTER], a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
Away with it! come[SEQ_SPLITTER], let me have a bigger.

KATHARINA:
I'll have no b[SEQ_SPLITTER]igger: this doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r such caps as these

PETRUCHIO:
When you are gent[SEQ_SPLITTER]le, you shall have one too,
And not till then.

HO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RTENSIO:

KATHARINA:
Why, sir, I trust I may have [SEQ_SPLITTER]leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, n[SEQ_SPLITTER]o babe:
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
My ton[SEQ_SPLITTER]gue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my he[SEQ_SPLITTER]art concealing it will break,
And rather than it s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall, I will be free
Even to the uttermost, as I p[SEQ_SPLITTER]lease, in words.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, thou say'st true[SEQ_SPLITTER]; it is a paltry cap,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, [SEQ_SPLITTER]a silken pie:
I love thee well, in that thou likes[SEQ_SPLITTER]t it not.

KATHARINA:
Love me or love me not, I li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke the cap;
And it I will have, or I will have non[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t us see't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere?
What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-canno[SEQ_SPLITTER]n:
What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
Li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke to a censer in a barber's shop:
Why, what, i' d[SEQ_SPLITTER]evil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?

HORTENSIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:

Tailor:
You bid me make it orderly and well,
Ac[SEQ_SPLITTER]cording to the fashion and the time.

PETRUCHIO:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]arry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
I did not[SEQ_SPLITTER] bid you mar it to the time.
Go, hop me over every[SEQ_SPLITTER] kennel home,
For you shall hop without my custom,[SEQ_SPLITTER] sir:
I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it[SEQ_SPLITTER].

KATHARINA:
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.

PETRUCHI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Tailor:
She says your worship means to make
a pupp[SEQ_SPLITTER]et of her.

PETRUCHIO:
O monstrous arrogance! Thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] liest, thou thread,
thou thimble,
Thou yard, thre[SEQ_SPLITTER]e-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Braved in mine [SEQ_SPLITTER]own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall so be-mete[SEQ_SPLITTER] thee with thy yard
As thou shalt think on prating[SEQ_SPLITTER] whilst thou livest!
I tell thee, I, that thou has[SEQ_SPLITTER]t marr'd her gown.

Tailor:
Your worship is deceiv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed; the gown is made
Just as my master had directi[SEQ_SPLITTER]on:
Grumio gave order how it should be done.

GRUM[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.

Ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]ilor:
But how did you desire it should be made?

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUMIO:
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.

Tailor[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
But did you not request to have it cut?

GRUMIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Thou hast faced many things.

Tailor:
I have.

GR[SEQ_SPLITTER]UMIO:
Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e not
me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y unto
thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t I did
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou l[SEQ_SPLITTER]iest.

Tailor:
Why, here is the note of the fashio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n to testify

PETRUCHIO:
Read it.

GRUMIO:
The not[SEQ_SPLITTER]e lies in's throat, if he say I said so.

Tailor:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
GRUMIO:
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown,[SEQ_SPLITTER] sew me in
the skirts of it, and beat me to death [SEQ_SPLITTER]with a bottom
of brown thread: I said a gown.

PET[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUCHIO:
Proceed.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ape.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess two sleeves.

Tai[SEQ_SPLITTER]lor:

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, there's the villany.

GRUMIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
I comm[SEQ_SPLITTER]anded the sleeves should be cut out and
sewed up a[SEQ_SPLITTER]gain; and that I'll prove upon thee,
though thy li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ttle finger be armed in a thimble.

Tailor:
This i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s true that I say: an I had thee
in place where, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou shouldst know it.

GRUMIO:
I am for thee strai[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght: take thou the
bill, give me thy mete-yard, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d spare not me.

HORTENSIO:
God-a-mercy, Grumio! t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen he shall have no odds.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, sir, [SEQ_SPLITTER]in brief, the gown is not for me.

GRUMIO:
You are[SEQ_SPLITTER] i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.

PETRUCH[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.

GRUMIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'
g[SEQ_SPLITTER]own for thy master's use!

PETRUCHIO:
Why, sir, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at's your conceit in that?

GRUMIO:
O, sir, the co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nceit is deeper than you think for:
Take up my mis[SEQ_SPLITTER]tress' gown to his master's use!
O, fie, fie, fie![SEQ_SPLITTER]

PETRUCHIO:

HORTENSIO:
Tailor, I'll pay thee for[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy gown tomorrow:
Take no unkindness of his hast[SEQ_SPLITTER]y words:
Away! I say; commend me to thy master.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ETRUCHIO:
Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather's
Even in these honest mean habiliments:
Our[SEQ_SPLITTER] purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
For 'ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the mind that makes the body rich;
And as the su[SEQ_SPLITTER]n breaks through the darkest clouds,
So honour pee[SEQ_SPLITTER]reth in the meanest habit.
What is the jay more pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ecious than the lark,
Because his fathers are more[SEQ_SPLITTER] beautiful?
Or is the adder better than the eel,
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ecause his painted skin contents the eye?
O, no, g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood Kate; neither art thou the worse
For this poor[SEQ_SPLITTER] furniture and mean array.
if thou account'st it s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hame. lay it on me;
And therefore frolic: we will [SEQ_SPLITTER]hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy fath[SEQ_SPLITTER]er's house.
Go, call my men, and let us straight t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o him;
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere will we mount, and thither walk on foot
Let's [SEQ_SPLITTER]see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well[SEQ_SPLITTER] we may come there by dinner-time.

KATHARINA:
I d[SEQ_SPLITTER]are assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
And 'twill b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e supper-time ere you come there.

PETRUCHIO:
It s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall be seven ere I go to horse:
Look, what I spea[SEQ_SPLITTER]k, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t. Sirs, let't alone:
I will not go to-day; and er[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I do,
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.

HOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]TENSIO:

TRANIO:
Sir, this is the house: please it[SEQ_SPLITTER] you that I call?

Pedant:
Ay, what else? and but [SEQ_SPLITTER]I be deceived
Signior Baptista may remember me,
Ne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were lodge[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs at the Pegasus.

TRANIO:
'Tis well; and hold yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur own, in any case,
With such austerity as 'longe[SEQ_SPLITTER]th to a father.

Pedant:
I warrant you.
But, sir, [SEQ_SPLITTER]here comes your boy;
'Twere good he were school'd.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

TRANIO:
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now [SEQ_SPLITTER]do your duty throughly, I advise you:
Imagine 'twe[SEQ_SPLITTER]re the right Vincentio.

BIONDELLO:
Tut, fear not [SEQ_SPLITTER]me.

TRANIO:
But hast thou done thy errand to Bapt[SEQ_SPLITTER]ista?

BIONDELLO:
I told him that your father was [SEQ_SPLITTER]at Venice,
And that you look'd for him this day in[SEQ_SPLITTER] Padua.

TRANIO:
Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee [SEQ_SPLITTER]that to drink.
Here comes Baptista: set your count[SEQ_SPLITTER]enance, sir.
Signior Baptista, you are happily met[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
I pray[SEQ_SPLITTER] you stand good father to me now,
Give me Bianca f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or my patrimony.

Pedant:
Soft son!
Sir, by your l[SEQ_SPLITTER]eave: having come to Padua
To gather in some debts[SEQ_SPLITTER], my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weight[SEQ_SPLITTER]y cause
Of love between your daughter and himself:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And, for the good report I hear of you
And for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e love he beareth to your daughter
And she to him,[SEQ_SPLITTER] to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good[SEQ_SPLITTER] father's care,
To have him match'd; and if you pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ease to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Me shall you find ready and willing
With one conse[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt to have her so bestow'd;
For curious I cannot b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e with you,
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll.

BAPTISTA:
Sir, pardon me in what I have to sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y:
Your plainness and your shortness please me wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l.
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
Doth l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove my daughter and she loveth him,
Or both dissem[SEQ_SPLITTER]ble deeply their affections:
And therefore, if you[SEQ_SPLITTER] say no more than this,
That like a father you wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l deal with him
And pass my daughter a sufficient [SEQ_SPLITTER]dower,
The match is made, and all is done:
Your so[SEQ_SPLITTER]n shall have my daughter with consent.

TRANIO:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
We be [SEQ_SPLITTER]
