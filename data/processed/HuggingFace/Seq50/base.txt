First Citizen:
Before we proceed any further, hear[SEQ_SPLITTER] me speak.

All:
Speak, speak.

First Citizen:
You[SEQ_SPLITTER] are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

A[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
First, you[SEQ_SPLITTER] know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
All:
We know't, we know't.

First Citizen:
Let us[SEQ_SPLITTER] kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]s't a verdict?

All:
No more talking on't; let it [SEQ_SPLITTER]be done: away, away!

Second Citizen:
One word, go[SEQ_SPLITTER]od citizens.

First Citizen:
We are accounted poor[SEQ_SPLITTER] citizens, the patricians good.
What authority sur[SEQ_SPLITTER]feits on would relieve us: if they
would yield us [SEQ_SPLITTER]but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight guess they relieved us humanely;
but they thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nk we are too dear: the leanness that
afflicts us,[SEQ_SPLITTER] the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to p[SEQ_SPLITTER]articularise their abundance; our
sufferance is a [SEQ_SPLITTER]gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes, e[SEQ_SPLITTER]re we become rakes: for the gods know I
speak this[SEQ_SPLITTER] in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Second Citizen:
Would you proceed especially again[SEQ_SPLITTER]st Caius Marcius?

All:
Against him first: he's a [SEQ_SPLITTER]very dog to the commonalty.

Second Citizen:
Consi[SEQ_SPLITTER]der you what services he has done for his country?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

First Citizen:
Very well; and could be content t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o give him good
report fort, but that he pays hims[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf with being proud.

Second Citizen:
Nay, but sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]eak not maliciously.

First Citizen:
I say unto yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u, what he hath done famously, he did
it to that e[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd: though soft-conscienced men can be
content to [SEQ_SPLITTER]say it was for his country he did it to
please his[SEQ_SPLITTER] mother and to be partly proud; which he
is, even [SEQ_SPLITTER]till the altitude of his virtue.

Second Citizen:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

First Citizen:
If I must not, I need not be barr[SEQ_SPLITTER]en of accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o tire in repetition.
What shouts are these? The o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther side o' the city
is risen: why stay we pratin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g here? to the Capitol!

All:
Come, come.

First C[SEQ_SPLITTER]itizen:
Soft! who comes here?

Second Citizen:
Wor[SEQ_SPLITTER]thy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he people.

First Citizen:
He's one honest enough:[SEQ_SPLITTER] would all the rest were so!

MENENIUS:
What work'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
With bats [SEQ_SPLITTER]and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.

First C[SEQ_SPLITTER]itizen:
Our business is not unknown to the senate;[SEQ_SPLITTER] they have
had inkling this fortnight what we inte[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd to do,
which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They [SEQ_SPLITTER]say poor
suitors have strong breaths: they shall k[SEQ_SPLITTER]now we
have strong arms too.

MENENIUS:
Why, maste[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
Will [SEQ_SPLITTER]you undo yourselves?

First Citizen:
We cannot, si[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, we are undone already.

MENENIUS:
I tell you, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]riends, most charitable care
Have the patricians o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f you. For your wants,
Your suffering in this dear[SEQ_SPLITTER]th, you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your[SEQ_SPLITTER] staves as lift them
Against the Roman state, whos[SEQ_SPLITTER]e course will on
The way it takes, cracking ten th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can [SEQ_SPLITTER]ever
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Your knee[SEQ_SPLITTER]s to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
You are tra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nsported by calamity
Thither where more attends yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u, and you slander
The helms o' the state, who car[SEQ_SPLITTER]e for you like fathers,
When you curse them as ene[SEQ_SPLITTER]mies.

First Citizen:
Care for us! True, indeed! T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hey ne'er cared for us
yet: suffer us to famish, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd their store-houses
crammed with grain; make edi[SEQ_SPLITTER]cts for usury, to
support usurers; repeal daily an[SEQ_SPLITTER]y wholesome act
established against the rich, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]provide more
piercing statutes daily, to chain up [SEQ_SPLITTER]and restrain
the poor. If the wars eat us not up, [SEQ_SPLITTER]they will; and
there's all the love they bear us.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
MENENIUS:
Either you must
Confess yourselves wond[SEQ_SPLITTER]rous malicious,
Or be accused of folly. I shall te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll you
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o stale 't a little more.

First Citizen:
Well, I'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
fob off[SEQ_SPLITTER] our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
you, [SEQ_SPLITTER]deliver.

MENENIUS:
There was a time when all the [SEQ_SPLITTER]body's members
Rebell'd against the belly, thus ac[SEQ_SPLITTER]cused it:
That only like a gulf it did remain
I' t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
Still cup[SEQ_SPLITTER]boarding the viand, never bearing
Like labour with[SEQ_SPLITTER] the rest, where the other instruments
Did see and[SEQ_SPLITTER] hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
And, mutually[SEQ_SPLITTER] participate, did minister
Unto the appetite and a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ffection common
Of the whole body. The belly answe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r'd--

First Citizen:
Well, sir, what answer made [SEQ_SPLITTER]the belly?

MENENIUS:
Sir, I shall tell you. With [SEQ_SPLITTER]a kind of smile,
Which ne'er came from the lungs, [SEQ_SPLITTER]but even thus--
For, look you, I may make the bell[SEQ_SPLITTER]y smile
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
To[SEQ_SPLITTER] the discontented members, the mutinous parts
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] envied his receipt; even so most fitly
As you mal[SEQ_SPLITTER]ign our senators for that
They are not such as you[SEQ_SPLITTER].

First Citizen:
Your belly's answer? What!
The k[SEQ_SPLITTER]ingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
The counsell[SEQ_SPLITTER]or heart, the arm our soldier,
Our steed the leg, [SEQ_SPLITTER]the tongue our trumpeter.
With other muniments and[SEQ_SPLITTER] petty helps
In this our fabric, if that they--

M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENENIUS:
What then?
'Fore me, this fellow speaks! [SEQ_SPLITTER]What then? what then?

First Citizen:
Should by th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e cormorant belly be restrain'd,
Who is the sink o[SEQ_SPLITTER]' the body,--

MENENIUS:
Well, what then?

First C[SEQ_SPLITTER]itizen:
The former agents, if they did complain,
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat could the belly answer?

MENENIUS:
I will tell[SEQ_SPLITTER] you
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ttle--
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's an[SEQ_SPLITTER]swer.

First Citizen:
Ye're long about it.

MENENI[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
Note me this, good friend;
Your most grave bel[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly was deliberate,
Not rash like his accusers, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] thus answer'd:
'True is it, my incorporate friend[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,' quoth he,
'That I receive the general food at [SEQ_SPLITTER]first,
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Beca[SEQ_SPLITTER]use I am the store-house and the shop
Of the whole[SEQ_SPLITTER] body: but, if you do remember,
I send it through [SEQ_SPLITTER]the rivers of your blood,
Even to the court, the h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eart, to the seat o' the brain;
And, through the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ranks and offices of man,
The strongest nerves and[SEQ_SPLITTER] small inferior veins
From me receive that natural[SEQ_SPLITTER] competency
Whereby they live: and though that all[SEQ_SPLITTER] at once,
You, my good friends,'--this says the be[SEQ_SPLITTER]lly, mark me,--

First Citizen:
Ay, sir; well, wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l.

MENENIUS:
'Though all at once cannot
See what [SEQ_SPLITTER]I do deliver out to each,
Yet I can make my audit [SEQ_SPLITTER]up, that all
From me do back receive the flour of [SEQ_SPLITTER]all,
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

First Citizen:
It was an answer: how apply you [SEQ_SPLITTER]this?

MENENIUS:
The senators of Rome are this goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d belly,
And you the mutinous members; for examine[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rig[SEQ_SPLITTER]htly
Touching the weal o' the common, you shall fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd
No public benefit which you receive
But it proc[SEQ_SPLITTER]eeds or comes from them to you
And no way from you[SEQ_SPLITTER]rselves. What do you think,
You, the great toe of [SEQ_SPLITTER]this assembly?

First Citizen:
I the great toe! wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]y the great toe?

MENENIUS:
For that, being one o'[SEQ_SPLITTER] the lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this most wise re[SEQ_SPLITTER]bellion, thou go'st foremost:
Thou rascal, that ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]t worst in blood to run,
Lead'st first to win some[SEQ_SPLITTER] vantage.
But make you ready your stiff bats and c[SEQ_SPLITTER]lubs:
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle[SEQ_SPLITTER];
The one side must have bale.
Hail, noble Marcius[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

MARCIUS:
Thanks. What's the matter, you dissent[SEQ_SPLITTER]ious rogues,
That, rubbing the poor itch of your o[SEQ_SPLITTER]pinion,
Make yourselves scabs?

First Citizen:
We [SEQ_SPLITTER]have ever your good word.

MARCIUS:
He that will g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing. What would you have, you curs,
That like nor [SEQ_SPLITTER]peace nor war? the one affrights you,
The other ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]kes you proud. He that trusts to you,
Where he sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld find you lions, finds you hares;
Where foxes, [SEQ_SPLITTER]geese: you are no surer, no,
Than is the coal of f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ire upon the ice,
Or hailstone in the sun. Your vi[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtue is
To make him worthy whose offence subdues h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im
And curse that justice did it.
Who deserves gre[SEQ_SPLITTER]atness
Deserves your hate; and your affections are[SEQ_SPLITTER]
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
Whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h would increase his evil. He that depends
Upon yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur favours swims with fins of lead
And hews down o[SEQ_SPLITTER]aks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
With every min[SEQ_SPLITTER]ute you do change a mind,
And call him noble that [SEQ_SPLITTER]was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland.[SEQ_SPLITTER] What's the matter,
That in these several places o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f the city
You cry against the noble senate, who,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Would [SEQ_SPLITTER]feed on one another? What's their seeking?

MENENI[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say[SEQ_SPLITTER],
The city is well stored.

MARCIUS:
Hang 'em! The[SEQ_SPLITTER]y say!
They'll sit by the fire, and presume to kno[SEQ_SPLITTER]w
What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Who thrives and who declines; side factions
and gi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve out
Conjectural marriages; making parties stron[SEQ_SPLITTER]g
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]elow their cobbled shoes. They say there's
grain e[SEQ_SPLITTER]nough!
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
With tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]usands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
As I cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld pick my lance.

MENENIUS:
Nay, these are almost[SEQ_SPLITTER] thoroughly persuaded;
For though abundantly they [SEQ_SPLITTER]lack discretion,
Yet are they passing cowardly. Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, I beseech you,
What says the other troop?

MARC[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
They are dissolved: hang 'em!
They said they [SEQ_SPLITTER]were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
That hunger[SEQ_SPLITTER] broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
That meat [SEQ_SPLITTER]was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
Corn f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or the rich men only: with these shreds
They vente[SEQ_SPLITTER]d their complainings; which being answer'd,
And a [SEQ_SPLITTER]petition granted them, a strange one--
To break th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e heart of generosity,
And make bold power look pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]le--they threw their caps
As they would hang them [SEQ_SPLITTER]on the horns o' the moon,
Shouting their emulation[SEQ_SPLITTER].

MENENIUS:
What is granted them?

MARCIUS:
Five [SEQ_SPLITTER]tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Of their [SEQ_SPLITTER]own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
Sicinius Velutus,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and I know not--'Sdeath!
The rabble should have f[SEQ_SPLITTER]irst unroof'd the city,
Ere so prevail'd with me: [SEQ_SPLITTER]it will in time
Win upon power and throw forth gre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ater themes
For insurrection's arguing.

MENENIUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
This is strange.

MARCIUS:
Go, get you home, you [SEQ_SPLITTER]fragments!

Messenger:
Where's Caius Marcius?

MAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]CIUS:
Here: what's the matter?

Messenger:
The new[SEQ_SPLITTER]s is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS:
I am[SEQ_SPLITTER] glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
Our m[SEQ_SPLITTER]usty superfluity. See, our best elders.

First Sen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ator:
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told[SEQ_SPLITTER] us;
The Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS:
They have [SEQ_SPLITTER]a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't[SEQ_SPLITTER].
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were I any th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing but what I am,
I would wish me only he.

COMIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
You have fought together.

MARCIUS:
Were half[SEQ_SPLITTER] to half the world by the ears and he.
Upon my par[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty, I'ld revolt to make
Only my wars with him: he [SEQ_SPLITTER]is a lion
That I am proud to hunt.

First Senator:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Then, worthy Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to the[SEQ_SPLITTER]se wars.

COMINIUS:
It is your former promise.

MA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RCIUS:
Sir, it is;
And I am constant. Titus Lartiu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace.
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?

TITUS:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, Caius Marcius;
I'll lean upon one crutch and fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght with t'other,
Ere stay behind this business.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MENENIUS:
O, true-bred!

First Senator:
Your compa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ny to the Capitol; where, I know,
Our greatest fri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ends attend us.

TITUS:

COMINIUS:
Noble Marcius!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
First Senator:

MARCIUS:
Nay, let them follow:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
Your v[SEQ_SPLITTER]alour puts well forth: pray, follow.

SICINIUS:
Wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

BRUTUS:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]e has no equal.

SICINIUS:
When we were chosen tri[SEQ_SPLITTER]bunes for the people,--

BRUTUS:
Mark'd you his li[SEQ_SPLITTER]p and eyes?

SICINIUS:
Nay. but his taunts.

BRUTU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods[SEQ_SPLITTER].

SICINIUS:
Be-mock the modest moon.

BRUTUS:
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] present wars devour him: he is grown
Too proud to[SEQ_SPLITTER] be so valiant.

SICINIUS:
Such a nature,
Tickled [SEQ_SPLITTER]with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eads on at noon: but I do wonder
His insolence can[SEQ_SPLITTER] brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.

BRUTUS:
Fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]me, at the which he aims,
In whom already he's wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l graced, can not
Better be held nor more attain'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] than by
A place below the first: for what miscarr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ies
Shall be the general's fault, though he perfor[SEQ_SPLITTER]m
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Will t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Had borne the busi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ness!'

SICINIUS:
Besides, if things go well,
Opin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Of his demerit[SEQ_SPLITTER]s rob Cominius.

BRUTUS:
Come:
Half all Cominius' [SEQ_SPLITTER]honours are to Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them[SEQ_SPLITTER] not, and all his faults
To Marcius shall be honou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs, though indeed
In aught he merit not.

SICINIUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Let's hence, and hear
How the dispatch is made, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and in what fashion,
More than his singularity, he[SEQ_SPLITTER] goes
Upon this present action.

BRUTUS:
Lets alon[SEQ_SPLITTER]g.

First Senator:
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]know how we proceed.

AUFIDIUS:
Is it not yours?
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat ever have been thought on in this state,
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circum[SEQ_SPLITTER]vention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard the[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce; these are the words: I think
I have the lette[SEQ_SPLITTER]r here; yes, here it is.
'They have press'd a powe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, but it is not known
Whether for east or west: t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he dearth is great;
The people mutinous; and it is[SEQ_SPLITTER] rumour'd,
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
Who i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of Rome worse hated than of you,
And Titus Larti[SEQ_SPLITTER]us, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this[SEQ_SPLITTER] preparation
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or you:
Consider of it.'

First Senator:
Our army'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s in the field
We never yet made doubt but Rome wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s ready
To answer us.

AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think[SEQ_SPLITTER] it folly
To keep your great pretences veil'd till[SEQ_SPLITTER] when
They needs must show themselves; which
in th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hatching,
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the di[SEQ_SPLITTER]scovery.
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which w[SEQ_SPLITTER]as
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow we were afoot.

Second Senator:
Noble Aufidius,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
Let [SEQ_SPLITTER]us alone to guard Corioli:
If they set down before[SEQ_SPLITTER] 's, for the remove
Bring your army; but, I think,[SEQ_SPLITTER] you'll find
They've not prepared for us.

AUFIDIU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
O, doubt not that;
I speak from certainties. Na[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, more,
Some parcels of their power are forth alr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eady,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]f we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn [SEQ_SPLITTER]between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no[SEQ_SPLITTER] more.

All:
The gods assist you!

AUFIDIUS:
And k[SEQ_SPLITTER]eep your honours safe!

First Senator:
Farewell.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Second Senator:
Farewell.

All:
Farewell.

VOLUMNI[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself[SEQ_SPLITTER] in a
more comfortable sort: if my son were my hus[SEQ_SPLITTER]band, I
should freelier rejoice in that absence wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]erein he
won honour than in the embracements of hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s bed where
he would show most love. When yet he w[SEQ_SPLITTER]as but
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, [SEQ_SPLITTER]when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, when
for a day of kings' entreaties a mother sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould not
sell him an hour from her beholding, I, c[SEQ_SPLITTER]onsidering
how honour would become such a person. [SEQ_SPLITTER]that it was
no better than picture-like to hang by[SEQ_SPLITTER] the wall, if
renown made it not stir, was pleased[SEQ_SPLITTER] to let him seek
danger where he was like to find [SEQ_SPLITTER]fame. To a cruel
war I sent him; from whence he re[SEQ_SPLITTER]turned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, dau[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghter, I sprang not
more in joy at first hearing h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had [SEQ_SPLITTER]proved himself a
man.

VIRGILIA:
But had he died i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the business, madam; how then?

VOLUMNIA:
Then h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is good report should have been my son; I
therein [SEQ_SPLITTER]would have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely:[SEQ_SPLITTER] had I a dozen sons, each in my love
alike and non[SEQ_SPLITTER]e less dear than thine and my good
Marcius, I had [SEQ_SPLITTER]rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than[SEQ_SPLITTER] one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

Gentlewo[SEQ_SPLITTER]man:
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

VIRGILIA:
Beseech you, give me leave to retire m[SEQ_SPLITTER]yself.

VOLUMNIA:
Indeed, you shall not.
Methinks [SEQ_SPLITTER]I hear hither your husband's drum,
See him pluck A[SEQ_SPLITTER]ufidius down by the hair,
As children from a bear,[SEQ_SPLITTER] the Volsces shunning him:
Methinks I see him stam[SEQ_SPLITTER]p thus, and call thus:
'Come on, you cowards! you [SEQ_SPLITTER]were got in fear,
Though you were born in Rome:' h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is bloody brow
With his mail'd hand then wiping, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]orth he goes,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]to mow
Or all or lose his hire.

VIRGILIA:
His blo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!

VOLUMNIA:
Away, yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u fool! it more becomes a man
Than gilt his trophy[SEQ_SPLITTER]: the breasts of Hecuba,
When she did suckle Hecto[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, look'd not lovelier
Than Hector's forehead when[SEQ_SPLITTER] it spit forth blood
At Grecian sword, contemning.[SEQ_SPLITTER] Tell Valeria,
We are fit to bid her welcome.

VIR[SEQ_SPLITTER]GILIA:
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

[SEQ_SPLITTER]VOLUMNIA:
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And tread upon his neck.

VALERIA:
My ladies both[SEQ_SPLITTER], good day to you.

VOLUMNIA:
Sweet madam.

VIRGIL[SEQ_SPLITTER]IA:
I am glad to see your ladyship.

VALERIA:
How [SEQ_SPLITTER]do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
What [SEQ_SPLITTER]are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
faith. H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow does your little son?

VIRGILIA:
I thank your l[SEQ_SPLITTER]adyship; well, good madam.

VOLUMNIA:
He had rathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r see the swords, and hear a drum, than
look upon [SEQ_SPLITTER]his school-master.

VALERIA:
O' my word, the fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's son: I'll swear,'tis a
very pretty boy. O' my [SEQ_SPLITTER]troth, I looked upon him o'
Wednesday half an hour[SEQ_SPLITTER] together: has such a
confirmed countenance. I saw[SEQ_SPLITTER] him run after a gilded
butterfly: and when he cau[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght it, he let it go
again; and after it again; an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d over and over he
comes, and again; catched it ag[SEQ_SPLITTER]ain; or whether his
fall enraged him, or how 'twas[SEQ_SPLITTER], he did so set his
teeth and tear it; O, I warran[SEQ_SPLITTER]t it, how he mammocked
it!

VOLUMNIA:
One on 's fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther's moods.

VALERIA:
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble c[SEQ_SPLITTER]hild.

VIRGILIA:
A crack, madam.

VALERIA:
Come, l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay aside your stitchery; I must have you play
the [SEQ_SPLITTER]idle husewife with me this afternoon.

VIRGILIA:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, good madam; I will not out of doors.

VALERIA:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA:
She shall, she shall.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not[SEQ_SPLITTER] over the
threshold till my lord return from the w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ars.

VALERIA:
Fie, you confine yourself most unre[SEQ_SPLITTER]asonably: come,
you must go visit the good lady th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at lies in.

VIRGILIA:
I will wish her speedy stre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngth, and visit her with
my prayers; but I cannot [SEQ_SPLITTER]go thither.

VOLUMNIA:
Why, I pray you?

VIRGILIA:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

V[SEQ_SPLITTER]ALERIA:
You would be another Penelope: yet, they s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did [SEQ_SPLITTER]but fill
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your [SEQ_SPLITTER]cambric
were sensible as your finger, that you mig[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht leave
pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go [SEQ_SPLITTER]with us.

VIRGILIA:
No, good madam, pardon me; ind[SEQ_SPLITTER]eed, I will not forth.

VALERIA:
In truth, la, go [SEQ_SPLITTER]with me; and I'll tell you
excellent news of your [SEQ_SPLITTER]husband.

VIRGILIA:
O, good madam, there can be no[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne yet.

VALERIA:
Verily, I do not jest with you; [SEQ_SPLITTER]there came news from
him last night.

VIRGILIA:
In[SEQ_SPLITTER]deed, madam?

VALERIA:
In earnest, it's true; I he[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard a senator speak it.
Thus it is: the Volsces ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve an army forth; against
whom Cominius the genera[SEQ_SPLITTER]l is gone, with one part of
our Roman power: your [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord and Titus Lartius are set
down before their c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ity Corioli; they nothing doubt
prevailing and to [SEQ_SPLITTER]make it brief wars. This is true,
on mine honour; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and so, I pray, go with us.

VIRGILIA:
Give me exc[SEQ_SPLITTER]use, good madam; I will obey you in every
thing he[SEQ_SPLITTER]reafter.

VOLUMNIA:
Let her alone, lady: as she is[SEQ_SPLITTER] now, she will but
disease our better mirth.

VALE[SEQ_SPLITTER]RIA:
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen.
Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, tur[SEQ_SPLITTER]n thy
solemness out o' door. and go along with us.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

VIRGILIA:
No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot. I wish
you much mirth.

VALERIA:
Well, then, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]arewell.

MARCIUS:
Yonder comes news. A wager they[SEQ_SPLITTER] have met.

LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, no.

MARCI[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
'Tis done.

LARTIUS:
Agreed.

MARCIUS:
Say, ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]s our general met the enemy?

Messenger:
They lie [SEQ_SPLITTER]in view; but have not spoke as yet.

LARTIUS:
So, [SEQ_SPLITTER]the good horse is mine.

MARCIUS:
I'll buy him of [SEQ_SPLITTER]you.

LARTIUS:
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: len[SEQ_SPLITTER]d you him I will
For half a hundred years. Summon [SEQ_SPLITTER]the town.

MARCIUS:
How far off lie these armies?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Messenger:
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now[SEQ_SPLITTER], Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
That we [SEQ_SPLITTER]with smoking swords may march from hence,
To help [SEQ_SPLITTER]our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
Tutus A[SEQ_SPLITTER]ufidius, is he within your walls?

First Senator:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
That's [SEQ_SPLITTER]lesser than a little.
Hark! our drums
Are bringing[SEQ_SPLITTER] forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
Rather th[SEQ_SPLITTER]an they shall pound us up: our gates,
Which yet se[SEQ_SPLITTER]em shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
They'll [SEQ_SPLITTER]open of themselves.
Hark you. far off!
There is Au[SEQ_SPLITTER]fidius; list, what work he makes
Amongst your clov[SEQ_SPLITTER]en army.

MARCIUS:
O, they are at it!

LARTIUS:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]eir noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!

MARCIU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow put your shields before your hearts, and fight
[SEQ_SPLITTER]With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e Titus:
They do disdain us much beyond our though[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts,
Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ellows:
He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce[SEQ_SPLITTER],
And he shall feel mine edge.

MARCIUS:
All the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ontagion of the south light on you,
You shames of [SEQ_SPLITTER]Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
Plaster you o[SEQ_SPLITTER]'er, that you may be abhorr'd
Further than seen an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You [SEQ_SPLITTER]souls of geese,
That bear the shapes of men, how h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Plut[SEQ_SPLITTER]o and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces [SEQ_SPLITTER]pale
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
If [SEQ_SPLITTER]you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
As they us to our trenches followed.
So, now the [SEQ_SPLITTER]gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
'Tis for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e followers fortune widens them,
Not for the flier[SEQ_SPLITTER]s: mark me, and do the like.

First Soldier:
Fool-[SEQ_SPLITTER]hardiness; not I.

Second Soldier:
Nor I.

First S[SEQ_SPLITTER]oldier:
See, they have shut him in.

All:
To the p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot, I warrant him.

LARTIUS:
What is become of Mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]cius?

All:
Slain, sir, doubtless.

First Soldier:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Following the fliers at the very heels,
With them[SEQ_SPLITTER] he enters; who, upon the sudden,
Clapp'd to their[SEQ_SPLITTER] gates: he is himself alone,
To answer all the cit[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.

LARTIUS:
O noble fellow!
Who sensibly outdares[SEQ_SPLITTER] his senseless sword,
And, when it bows, stands up[SEQ_SPLITTER]. Thou art left, Marcius:
A carbuncle entire, as b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ig as thou art,
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou was[SEQ_SPLITTER]t a soldier
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and te[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrible
Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
Thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
Were f[SEQ_SPLITTER]everous and did tremble.

First Soldier:
Look, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER].

LARTIUS:
O,'tis Marcius!
Let's fetch him off, o[SEQ_SPLITTER]r make remain alike.

First Roman:
This will I car[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry to Rome.

Second Roman:
And I this.

Third Roma[SEQ_SPLITTER]n:
A murrain on't! I took this for silver.

MARCIU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
See here these movers that do prize their hours[SEQ_SPLITTER]
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
Iro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Bury wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h those that wore them, these base slaves,
Ere yet[SEQ_SPLITTER] the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
And h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ark, what noise the general makes! To him!
There i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Piercing ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
Convenient num[SEQ_SPLITTER]bers to make good the city;
Whilst I, with those t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat have the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
LARTIUS:
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
Thy exercise [SEQ_SPLITTER]hath been too violent for
A second course of fight[SEQ_SPLITTER].

MARCIUS:
Sir, praise me not;
My work hath yet n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot warm'd me: fare you well:
The blood I drop is r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather physical
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hus
I will appear, and fight.

LARTIUS:
Now the fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir goddess, Fortune,
Fall deep in love with thee; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and her great charms
Misguide thy opposers' swords[SEQ_SPLITTER]! Bold gentleman,
Prosperity be thy page!

MARCIUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Thy friend no less
Than those she placeth highes[SEQ_SPLITTER]t! So, farewell.

LARTIUS:
Thou worthiest Marcius![SEQ_SPLITTER]
Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
Call t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hither all the officers o' the town,
Where they sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all know our mind: away!

COMINIUS:
Breathe you, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y friends: well fought;
we are come off
Like Roman[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, neither foolish in our stands,
Nor cowardly in [SEQ_SPLITTER]retire: believe me, sirs,
We shall be charged agai[SEQ_SPLITTER]n. Whiles we have struck,
By interims and conveyin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Ye Roman gods!
Lead their successes as we wish our[SEQ_SPLITTER] own,
That both our powers, with smiling
fronts en[SEQ_SPLITTER]countering,
May give you thankful sacrifice.
Thy n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ews?

Messenger:
The citizens of Corioli have issu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed,
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]saw our party to their trenches driven,
And then I[SEQ_SPLITTER] came away.

COMINIUS:
Though thou speak'st truth,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Methinks thou speak'st not well.
How long is't si[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce?

Messenger:
Above an hour, my lord.

COMINIUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
And br[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing thy news so late?

Messenger:
Spies of the Vol[SEQ_SPLITTER]sces
Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
Half a[SEQ_SPLITTER]n hour since brought my report.

COMINIUS:
Who's y[SEQ_SPLITTER]onder,
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
[SEQ_SPLITTER]He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-tim[SEQ_SPLITTER]e seen him thus.

MARCIUS:

COMINIUS:
The shepherd[SEQ_SPLITTER] knows not thunder from a tabour
More than I know [SEQ_SPLITTER]the sound of Marcius' tongue
From every meaner man[SEQ_SPLITTER].

MARCIUS:
Come I too late?

COMINIUS:
Ay, if you[SEQ_SPLITTER] come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our own.

MARCIUS:
O, let me clip ye
In arms as so[SEQ_SPLITTER]und as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our[SEQ_SPLITTER] nuptial day was done,
And tapers burn'd to bedwar[SEQ_SPLITTER]d!

COMINIUS:
Flower of warriors,
How is it with T[SEQ_SPLITTER]itus Lartius?

MARCIUS:
As with a man busied about[SEQ_SPLITTER] decrees:
Condemning some to death, and some to ex[SEQ_SPLITTER]ile;
Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the ot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her;
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
Even lik[SEQ_SPLITTER]e a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To let him sli[SEQ_SPLITTER]p at will.

COMINIUS:
Where is that slave
Which to[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld me they had beat you to your trenches?
Where is[SEQ_SPLITTER] he? call him hither.

MARCIUS:
Let him alone;
He [SEQ_SPLITTER]did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
The c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ommon file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
The mou[SEQ_SPLITTER]se ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
From ra[SEQ_SPLITTER]scals worse than they.

COMINIUS:
But how prevail'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d you?

MARCIUS:
Will the time serve to tell? I do[SEQ_SPLITTER] not think.
Where is the enemy? are you lords o' t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he field?
If not, why cease you till you are so?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]COMINIUS:
Marcius,
We have at disadvantage fought [SEQ_SPLITTER]and did
Retire to win our purpose.

MARCIUS:
How l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ies their battle? know you on which side
They have[SEQ_SPLITTER] placed their men of trust?

COMINIUS:
As I guess,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Marcius,
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiat[SEQ_SPLITTER]es,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their[SEQ_SPLITTER] very heart of hope.

MARCIUS:
I do beseech you,
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]y all the battles wherein we have fought,
By the b[SEQ_SPLITTER]lood we have shed together, by the vows
We have ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]de to endure friends, that you directly
Set me aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]inst Aufidius and his Antiates;
And that you not d[SEQ_SPLITTER]elay the present, but,
Filling the air with swords[SEQ_SPLITTER] advanced and darts,
We prove this very hour.

COM[SEQ_SPLITTER]INIUS:
Though I could wish
You were conducted to a[SEQ_SPLITTER] gentle bath
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I[SEQ_SPLITTER] never
Deny your asking: take your choice of those[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That best can aid your action.

MARCIUS:
Those ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e they
That most are willing. If any such be here-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-
As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Lesser hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s person than an ill report;
If any think brave de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath outweighs bad life
And that his country's dear[SEQ_SPLITTER]er than himself;
Let him alone, or so many so mind[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed,
Wave thus, to express his disposition,
And fol[SEQ_SPLITTER]low Marcius.
O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]If these shows be not outward, which of you
But is[SEQ_SPLITTER] four Volsces? none of you but is
Able to bear aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]inst the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A[SEQ_SPLITTER] certain number,
Though thanks to all, must I sele[SEQ_SPLITTER]ct
from all: the rest
Shall bear the business in s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome other fight,
As cause will be obey'd. Please y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou to march;
And four shall quickly draw out my co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mmand,
Which men are best inclined.

COMINIUS:
Mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch on, my fellows:
Make good this ostentation, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] you shall
Divide in all with us.

LARTIUS:
So, le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
As I hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e set them down. If I do send, dispatch
Those cent[SEQ_SPLITTER]uries to our aid: the rest will serve
For a short [SEQ_SPLITTER]holding: if we lose the field,
We cannot keep the [SEQ_SPLITTER]town.

Lieutenant:
Fear not our care, sir.

LARTIU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
Our guider, [SEQ_SPLITTER]come; to the Roman camp conduct us.

MARCIUS:
I'll[SEQ_SPLITTER] fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
Wors[SEQ_SPLITTER]e than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS:
We hate alike[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ame and envy. Fix thy foot.

MARCIUS:
Let the firs[SEQ_SPLITTER]t budger die the other's slave,
And the gods doom [SEQ_SPLITTER]him after!

AUFIDIUS:
If I fly, Marcius,
Holloa me[SEQ_SPLITTER] like a hare.

MARCIUS:
Within these three hours, [SEQ_SPLITTER]Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
Wherei[SEQ_SPLITTER]n thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy power to the highest.

AUFIDIUS:
Wert thou the[SEQ_SPLITTER] Hector
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Thou shouldst not scape me here.
Officious, and n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot valiant, you have shamed me
In your condemned s[SEQ_SPLITTER]econds.

COMINIUS:
If I should tell thee o'er this[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy day's work,
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: [SEQ_SPLITTER]but I'll report it
Where senators shall mingle tea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs with smiles,
Where great patricians shall atten[SEQ_SPLITTER]d and shrug,
I' the end admire, where ladies shall[SEQ_SPLITTER] be frighted,
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where[SEQ_SPLITTER] the
dull tribunes,
That, with the fusty plebeians[SEQ_SPLITTER], hate thine honours,
Shall say against their hear[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts 'We thank the gods
Our Rome hath such a soldier[SEQ_SPLITTER].'
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
Havi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng fully dined before.

LARTIUS:
O general,
Here i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the steed, we the caparison:
Hadst thou beheld--[SEQ_SPLITTER]

MARCIUS:
Pray now, no more: my mother,
Who has a[SEQ_SPLITTER] charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise [SEQ_SPLITTER]me grieves me. I have done
As you have done; that'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s what I can; induced
As you have been; that's for[SEQ_SPLITTER] my country:
He that has but effected his good wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l
Hath overta'en mine act.

COMINIUS:
You shall no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t be
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he value of her own: 'twere a concealment
Worse th[SEQ_SPLITTER]an a theft, no less than a traducement,
To hide yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur doings; and to silence that,
Which, to the spir[SEQ_SPLITTER]e and top of praises vouch'd,
Would seem but modes[SEQ_SPLITTER]t: therefore, I beseech you
In sign of what you ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, not to reward
What you have done--before our ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]my hear me.

MARCIUS:
I have some wounds upon me, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and they smart
To hear themselves remember'd.

COM[SEQ_SPLITTER]INIUS:
Should they not,
Well might they fester 'ga[SEQ_SPLITTER]inst ingratitude,
And tent themselves with death. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Of all the horses,
Whereof we have ta'en good and [SEQ_SPLITTER]good store, of all
The treasure in this field achi[SEQ_SPLITTER]eved and city,
We render you the tenth, to be ta'e[SEQ_SPLITTER]n forth,
Before the common distribution, at
Your o[SEQ_SPLITTER]nly choice.

MARCIUS:
I thank you, general;
But ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]nnot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay [SEQ_SPLITTER]my sword: I do refuse it;
And stand upon my common[SEQ_SPLITTER] part with those
That have beheld the doing.

MARC[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
May these same instruments, which you profane[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and citi[SEQ_SPLITTER]es be
Made all of false-faced soothing!
When steel[SEQ_SPLITTER] grows soft as the parasite's silk,
Let him be mad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e a coverture for the wars!
No more, I say! For th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at I have not wash'd
My nose that bled, or foil'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]some debile wretch.--
Which, without note, here's [SEQ_SPLITTER]many else have done,--
You shout me forth
In accla[SEQ_SPLITTER]mations hyperbolical;
As if I loved my little shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld be dieted
In praises sauced with lies.

COMINIU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Too modest are you;
More cruel to your good rep[SEQ_SPLITTER]ort than grateful
To us that give you truly: by yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur patience,
If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, [SEQ_SPLITTER]we'll put you,
Like one that means his proper harm[SEQ_SPLITTER], in manacles,
Then reason safely with you. Theref[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore, be it known,
As to us, to all the world, that[SEQ_SPLITTER] Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland: in token [SEQ_SPLITTER]of the which,
My noble steed, known to the camp, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] give him,
With all his trim belonging; and from t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his time,
For what he did before Corioli, call him[SEQ_SPLITTER],
With all the applause and clamour of the host,
C[SEQ_SPLITTER]AIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
The addition nobly e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ver!

All:
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I will go wash;
And when my face is fair, you shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l perceive
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank[SEQ_SPLITTER] you.
I mean to stride your steed, and at all time[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
To undercrest your good addition
To the fairness[SEQ_SPLITTER] of my power.

COMINIUS:
So, to our tent;
Where, e[SEQ_SPLITTER]re we do repose us, we will write
To Rome of our s[SEQ_SPLITTER]uccess. You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: [SEQ_SPLITTER]send us to Rome
The best, with whom we may articul[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate,
For their own good and ours.

LARTIUS:
I shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
The gods begin to mock me[SEQ_SPLITTER]. I, that now
Refused most princely gifts, am boun[SEQ_SPLITTER]d to beg
Of my lord general.

COMINIUS:
Take't; 't[SEQ_SPLITTER]is yours. What is't?

CORIOLANUS:
I sometime lay h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me k[SEQ_SPLITTER]indly:
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n Aufidius was within my view,
And wrath o'erwhelm[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d my pity: I request you
To give my poor host fre[SEQ_SPLITTER]edom.

COMINIUS:
O, well begg'd!
Were he the butch[SEQ_SPLITTER]er of my son, he should
Be free as is the wind. De[SEQ_SPLITTER]liver him, Titus.

LARTIUS:
Marcius, his name?

CO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RIOLANUS:
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?

COMINIUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Go we to our tent:
The blood upon your visage drie[SEQ_SPLITTER]s; 'tis time
It should be look'd to: come.

AUFIDI[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
The town is ta'en!

First Soldier:
'Twill be d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eliver'd back on good condition.

AUFIDIUS:
Condit[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
Being a[SEQ_SPLITTER] Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
What good condit[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion can a treaty find
I' the part that is at mercy[SEQ_SPLITTER]? Five times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee: so[SEQ_SPLITTER] often hast thou beat me,
And wouldst do so, I thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nk, should we encounter
As often as we eat. By the[SEQ_SPLITTER] elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard[SEQ_SPLITTER],
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not [SEQ_SPLITTER]that honour in't it had; for where
I thought to cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword, I'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll potch at him some way
Or wrath or craft may get[SEQ_SPLITTER] him.

First Soldier:
He's the devil.

AUFIDIUS:
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]older, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
[SEQ_SPLITTER]With only suffering stain by him; for him
Shall fl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being na[SEQ_SPLITTER]ked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of[SEQ_SPLITTER] fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and cu[SEQ_SPLITTER]stom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius: where I find him,[SEQ_SPLITTER] were it
At home, upon my brother's guard, even th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my[SEQ_SPLITTER] fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
Learn[SEQ_SPLITTER] how 'tis held; and what they are that must
Be hos[SEQ_SPLITTER]tages for Rome.

First Soldier:
Will not you go?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]AUFIDIUS:
I am attended at the cypress grove: I pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay you--
'Tis south the city mills--bring me word [SEQ_SPLITTER]thither
How the world goes, that to the pace of it[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I may spur on my journey.

First Soldier:
I shall[SEQ_SPLITTER], sir.

MENENIUS:
The augurer tells me we shall ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve news to-night.

BRUTUS:
Good or bad?

MENENIUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Not according to the prayer of the people, for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey
love not Marcius.

SICINIUS:
Nature teaches bea[SEQ_SPLITTER]sts to know their friends.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]o does the wolf love?

SICINIUS:
The lamb.

MENENI[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld the
noble Marcius.

BRUTUS:
He's a lamb indeed,[SEQ_SPLITTER] that baes like a bear.

MENENIUS:
He's a bear ind[SEQ_SPLITTER]eed, that lives like a lamb. You two
are old men: [SEQ_SPLITTER]tell me one thing that I shall ask you.

Both:
Wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, sir.

MENENIUS:
In what enormity is Marcius poo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r in, that you two
have not in abundance?

BRUTUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]SICINIUS:
Especially in pride.

BRUTUS:
And toppin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g all others in boasting.

MENENIUS:
This is stran[SEQ_SPLITTER]ge now: do you two know how you are
censured here [SEQ_SPLITTER]in the city, I mean of us o' the
right-hand file? [SEQ_SPLITTER]do you?

Both:
Why, how are we censured?

MENENIUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be [SEQ_SPLITTER]angry?

Both:
Well, well, sir, well.

MENENIUS:
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patienc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e:
give your dispositions the reins, and be angry [SEQ_SPLITTER]at
your pleasures; at the least if you take it as [SEQ_SPLITTER]a
pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or
being proud?

BRUTUS:
We do it not alone, sir.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
MENENIUS:
I know you can do very little alone; fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r your helps
are many, or else your actions would [SEQ_SPLITTER]grow wondrous
single: your abilities are too infan[SEQ_SPLITTER]t-like for
doing much alone. You talk of pride: O [SEQ_SPLITTER]that you
could turn your eyes toward the napes of [SEQ_SPLITTER]your necks,
and make but an interior survey of you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r good selves!
O that you could!

BRUTUS:
What the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, sir?

MENENIUS:
Why, then you should discover a[SEQ_SPLITTER] brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy magist[SEQ_SPLITTER]rates, alias fools, as
any in Rome.

SICINIUS:
Men[SEQ_SPLITTER]enius, you are known well enough too.

MENENIUS:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that[SEQ_SPLITTER]
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allayi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng
Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
f[SEQ_SPLITTER]avouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-lik[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
upon too trivial motion; one that converses more[SEQ_SPLITTER]
with the buttock of the night than with the foreh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ead
of the morning: what I think I utter, and spen[SEQ_SPLITTER]d my
malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsme[SEQ_SPLITTER]n as
you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the[SEQ_SPLITTER] drink
you give me touch my palate adversely, I ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke a
crooked face at it. I can't say your worships[SEQ_SPLITTER] have
delivered the matter well, when I find the a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss in
compound with the major part of your syllabl[SEQ_SPLITTER]es: and
though I must be content to bear with thos[SEQ_SPLITTER]e that say
you are reverend grave men, yet they li[SEQ_SPLITTER]e deadly that
tell you you have good faces. If you[SEQ_SPLITTER] see this in
the map of my microcosm, follows it t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat I am known
well enough too? what barm can your[SEQ_SPLITTER] bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character[SEQ_SPLITTER], if I be
known well enough too?

BRUTUS:
Come, si[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, come, we know you well enough.

MENENIUS:
You k[SEQ_SPLITTER]now neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
are [SEQ_SPLITTER]ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
wear[SEQ_SPLITTER] out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause [SEQ_SPLITTER]between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and th[SEQ_SPLITTER]en rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
sec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ond day of audience. When you are hearing a
matter[SEQ_SPLITTER] between party and party, if you chance to be
pinc[SEQ_SPLITTER]hed with the colic, you make faces like
mummers; s[SEQ_SPLITTER]et up the bloody flag against all
patience; and, i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n roaring for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the controver[SEQ_SPLITTER]sy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing: al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l the peace you make in their
cause is, calling bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]th the parties knaves. You are
a pair of strange o[SEQ_SPLITTER]nes.

BRUTUS:
Come, come, you are well understood [SEQ_SPLITTER]to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a neces[SEQ_SPLITTER]sary
bencher in the Capitol.

MENENIUS:
Our very p[SEQ_SPLITTER]riests must become mockers, if they shall
encounte[SEQ_SPLITTER]r such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
you sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]eak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
wag[SEQ_SPLITTER]ging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
cushi[SEQ_SPLITTER]on, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
saddle. Ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]t you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
who in a c[SEQ_SPLITTER]heap estimation, is worth predecessors
since Deuca[SEQ_SPLITTER]lion, though peradventure some of the
best of 'em [SEQ_SPLITTER]were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
your worships:[SEQ_SPLITTER] more of your conversation would
infect my brain, [SEQ_SPLITTER]being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians: I wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be bold to take my leave of you.
How now, my as [SEQ_SPLITTER]fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
were she eart[SEQ_SPLITTER]hly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
your eyes s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o fast?

VOLUMNIA:
Honourable Menenius, my boy Mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]cius approaches; for
the love of Juno, let's go.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MENENIUS:
Ha! Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, [SEQ_SPLITTER]worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
approbat[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion.

MENENIUS:
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee. Hoo!
Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
Nay,'ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]s true.

VOLUMNIA:
Look, here's a letter from him:[SEQ_SPLITTER] the state hath
another, his wife another; and, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]think, there's one
at home for you.

MENENIUS:
I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
[SEQ_SPLITTER]me!

VIRGILIA:
Yes, certain, there's a letter for [SEQ_SPLITTER]you; I saw't.

MENENIUS:
A letter for me! it gives[SEQ_SPLITTER] me an estate of seven
years' health; in which tim[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I will make a lip at
the physician: the most sov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ereign prescription in
Galen is but empiricutic, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, to this preservative,
of no better report than[SEQ_SPLITTER] a horse-drench. Is he
not wounded? he was wont to[SEQ_SPLITTER] come home wounded.

VIRGILIA:
O, no, no, no.

VOL[SEQ_SPLITTER]UMNIA:
O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MENENIUS:
So do I too, if it be not too much: brin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gs a'
victory in his pocket? the wounds become him[SEQ_SPLITTER].

VOLUMNIA:
On's brows: Menenius, he comes the th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ird time home
with the oaken garland.

MENENIUS:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]as he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA:
Tit[SEQ_SPLITTER]us Lartius writes, they fought together, but
Aufid[SEQ_SPLITTER]ius got off.

MENENIUS:
And 'twas time for him too[SEQ_SPLITTER], I'll warrant him that:
an he had stayed by him, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I would not have been so
fidiused for all the ches[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts in Corioli, and the gold
that's in them. Is the[SEQ_SPLITTER] senate possessed of this?

VOLUMNIA:
Good ladies,[SEQ_SPLITTER] let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
has letters f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom the general, wherein he gives my
son the whole[SEQ_SPLITTER] name of the war: he hath in this
action outdone h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is former deeds doubly

VALERIA:
In troth, there's[SEQ_SPLITTER] wondrous things spoke of him.

MENENIUS:
Wondrous[SEQ_SPLITTER]! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
true purc[SEQ_SPLITTER]hasing.

VIRGILIA:
The gods grant them true!

VOLU[SEQ_SPLITTER]MNIA:
True! pow, wow.

MENENIUS:
True! I'll be swo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rn they are true.
Where is he wounded?
God save yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur good worships! Marcius is coming
home: he has m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?

VOLUM[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIA:
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be
large cicatrices to show the people, when he [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall
stand for his place. He received in the repu[SEQ_SPLITTER]lse of
Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.

MENENIUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ine that I know.

VOLUMNIA:
He had, before this la[SEQ_SPLITTER]st expedition, twenty-five
wounds upon him.

MENEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enem[SEQ_SPLITTER]y's grave.
Hark! the trumpets.

VOLUMNIA:
These ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e the ushers of Marcius: before him he
carries noi[SEQ_SPLITTER]se, and behind him he leaves tears:
Death, that da[SEQ_SPLITTER]rk spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
Which, being [SEQ_SPLITTER]advanced, declines, and then men die.

Herald:
Kno[SEQ_SPLITTER]w, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
Within C[SEQ_SPLITTER]orioli gates: where he hath won,
With fame, a name[SEQ_SPLITTER] to Caius Marcius; these
In honour follows Coriola[SEQ_SPLITTER]nus.
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

All:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]elcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now[SEQ_SPLITTER], no more.

COMINIUS:
Look, sir, your mother!

COR[SEQ_SPLITTER]IOLANUS:
O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ods
For my prosperity!

VOLUMNIA:
Nay, my good sol[SEQ_SPLITTER]dier, up;
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
By [SEQ_SPLITTER]deed-achieving honour newly named,--
What is it?--[SEQ_SPLITTER]Coriolanus must I call thee?--
But O, thy wife!

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORIOLANUS:
My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
That weep'[SEQ_SPLITTER]st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
Such eyes the w[SEQ_SPLITTER]idows in Corioli wear,
And mothers that lack sons.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

MENENIUS:
Now, the gods crown thee!

CORIOLANUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And live you yet?
O my sweet lady, pardon.

VOLUM[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIA:
I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.

MENENI[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
A cu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rse begin at very root on's heart,
That is not gla[SEQ_SPLITTER]d to see thee! You are three
That Rome should dote[SEQ_SPLITTER] on: yet, by the faith of men,
We have some old cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ab-trees here
at home that will not
Be grafted to [SEQ_SPLITTER]your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
We call a nett[SEQ_SPLITTER]le but a nettle and
The faults of fools but folly.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

COMINIUS:
Ever right.

CORIOLANUS:
Menenius ever[SEQ_SPLITTER], ever.

Herald:
Give way there, and go on!

CORIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LANUS:

VOLUMNIA:
I have lived
To see inherited my[SEQ_SPLITTER] very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy: only
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]here's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r Rome will cast upon thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Know, goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Than sway with them in theirs.

COMINIUS:
On, to [SEQ_SPLITTER]the Capitol!

BRUTUS:
All tongues speak of him, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him: yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
Her[SEQ_SPLITTER] richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clambering[SEQ_SPLITTER] the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
Are[SEQ_SPLITTER] smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
Wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestnes[SEQ_SPLITTER]s to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station[SEQ_SPLITTER]: or veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and dama[SEQ_SPLITTER]sk in
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spo[SEQ_SPLITTER]il
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
As if[SEQ_SPLITTER] that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slily crep[SEQ_SPLITTER]t into his human powers
And gave him graceful post[SEQ_SPLITTER]ure.

SICINIUS:
On the sudden,
I warrant him consu[SEQ_SPLITTER]l.

BRUTUS:
Then our office may,
During his power,[SEQ_SPLITTER] go sleep.

SICINIUS:
He cannot temperately transp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ort his honours
From where he should begin and end[SEQ_SPLITTER], but will
Lose those he hath won.

BRUTUS:
In tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t there's comfort.

SICINIUS:
Doubt not
The common[SEQ_SPLITTER]ers, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their ancien[SEQ_SPLITTER]t malice will forget
With the least cause these hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s new honours, which
That he will give them make I[SEQ_SPLITTER] as little question
As he is proud to do't.

BRUTU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul,[SEQ_SPLITTER] never would he
Appear i' the market-place nor on [SEQ_SPLITTER]him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor showi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng, as the manner is, his wounds
To the people, be[SEQ_SPLITTER]g their stinking breaths.

SICINIUS:
'Tis right.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]BRUTUS:
It was his word: O, he would miss it rathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im,
And the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS:
I wis[SEQ_SPLITTER]h no better
Than have him hold that purpose and to[SEQ_SPLITTER] put it
In execution.

BRUTUS:
'Tis most like he w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill.

SICINIUS:
It shall be to him then as our goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d wills,
A sure destruction.

BRUTUS:
So it must f[SEQ_SPLITTER]all out
To him or our authorities. For an end,
We [SEQ_SPLITTER]must suggest the people in what hatred
He still ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th held them; that to's power he would
Have made t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hem mules, silenced their pleaders and
Disproperti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed their freedoms, holding them,
In human action a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd capacity,
Of no more soul nor fitness for the w[SEQ_SPLITTER]orld
Than camels in the war, who have their provan[SEQ_SPLITTER]d
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sin[SEQ_SPLITTER]king under them.

SICINIUS:
This, as you say, sugg[SEQ_SPLITTER]ested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l touch the people--which time shall not want,
If [SEQ_SPLITTER]he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
As to set do[SEQ_SPLITTER]gs on sheep--will be his fire
To kindle their dry [SEQ_SPLITTER]stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever[SEQ_SPLITTER].

BRUTUS:
What's the matter?

Messenger:
You are [SEQ_SPLITTER]sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
That Marcius[SEQ_SPLITTER] shall be consul:
I have seen the dumb men throng [SEQ_SPLITTER]to see him and
The blind to bear him speak: matron[SEQ_SPLITTER]s flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and [SEQ_SPLITTER]handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles be[SEQ_SPLITTER]nded,
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
A [SEQ_SPLITTER]shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
I n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ever saw the like.

BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]hearts for the event.

SICINIUS:
Have with you.

F[SEQ_SPLITTER]irst Officer:
Come, come, they are almost here. Ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w many stand
for consulships?

Second Officer:
Thr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
Coriol[SEQ_SPLITTER]anus will carry it.

First Officer:
That's a brave[SEQ_SPLITTER] fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
loves not t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he common people.

Second Officer:
Faith, there ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]d been many great men that have
flattered the peop[SEQ_SPLITTER]le, who ne'er loved them; and there
be many that t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hey have loved, they know not
wherefore: so that, [SEQ_SPLITTER]if they love they know not why,
they hate upon no [SEQ_SPLITTER]better a ground: therefore, for
Coriolanus neither[SEQ_SPLITTER] to care whether they love or hate
him manifests t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he true knowledge he has in their
disposition; and[SEQ_SPLITTER] out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee't.

First Officer:
If he did not care whether h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e had their love or no,
he waved indifferently 'tw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ixt doing them neither
good nor harm: but he seeks[SEQ_SPLITTER] their hate with greater
devotion than can render [SEQ_SPLITTER]it him; and leaves
nothing undone that may fully d[SEQ_SPLITTER]iscover him their
opposite. Now, to seem to affect[SEQ_SPLITTER] the malice and
displeasure of the people is as ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]d as that which he
dislikes, to flatter them for t[SEQ_SPLITTER]heir love.

Second Officer:
He hath deserved worth[SEQ_SPLITTER]ily of his country: and his
ascent is not by such [SEQ_SPLITTER]easy degrees as those who,
having been supple and [SEQ_SPLITTER]courteous to the people,
bonneted, without any fur[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther deed to have them at
an into their estimation[SEQ_SPLITTER] and report: but he hath so
planted his honours in[SEQ_SPLITTER] their eyes, and his actions
in their hearts, that[SEQ_SPLITTER] for their tongues to be
silent, and not confess s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o much, were a kind of
ingrateful injury; to repor[SEQ_SPLITTER]t otherwise, were a
malice, that, giving itself th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e lie, would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar that heard it.

First Officer:
No more of him; [SEQ_SPLITTER]he is a worthy man: make way, they
are coming.

ME[SEQ_SPLITTER]NENIUS:
Having determined of the Volsces and
To se[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd for Titus Lartius, it remains,
As the main poin[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of this our after-meeting,
To gratify his noble [SEQ_SPLITTER]service that
Hath thus stood for his country: ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]efore,
please you,
Most reverend and grave elders,[SEQ_SPLITTER] to desire
The present consul, and last general
In[SEQ_SPLITTER] our well-found successes, to report
A little of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat worthy work perform'd
By Caius Marcius Coriola[SEQ_SPLITTER]nus, whom
We met here both to thank and to remembe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r
With honours like himself.

First Senator:
Speak[SEQ_SPLITTER], good Cominius:
Leave nothing out for length, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] make us think
Rather our state's defective for re[SEQ_SPLITTER]quital
Than we to stretch it out.
Masters o' the p[SEQ_SPLITTER]eople,
We do request your kindest ears, and after,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Your loving motion toward the common body,
To yie[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld what passes here.

SICINIUS:
We are convented
U[SEQ_SPLITTER]pon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
Inclinable [SEQ_SPLITTER]to honour and advance
The theme of our assembly.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]BRUTUS:
Which the rather
We shall be blest to do, [SEQ_SPLITTER]if he remember
A kinder value of the people than
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hath hereto prized them at.

MENENIUS:
That's of[SEQ_SPLITTER]f, that's off;
I would you rather had been silent.[SEQ_SPLITTER] Please you
To hear Cominius speak?

BRUTUS:
Most [SEQ_SPLITTER]willingly;
But yet my caution was more pertinent
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]han the rebuke you give it.

MENENIUS:
He loves yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur people
But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]orthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, keep your place.

Firs[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Senator:
Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at you have nobly done.

CORIOLANUS:
Your horror's[SEQ_SPLITTER] pardon:
I had rather have my wounds to heal again[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Than hear say how I got them.

BRUTUS:
Sir, I hop[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
My words disbench'd you not.

CORIOLANUS:
No, si[SEQ_SPLITTER]r: yet oft,
When blows have made me stay, I fled f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom words.
You soothed not, therefore hurt not: bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
your people,
I love them as they weigh.

MENENIU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Pray now, sit down.

CORIOLANUS:
I had rather h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave one scratch my head i' the sun
When the alarum[SEQ_SPLITTER] were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings mon[SEQ_SPLITTER]ster'd.

MENENIUS:
Masters of the people,
Your mul[SEQ_SPLITTER]tiplying spawn how can he flatter--
That's thousan[SEQ_SPLITTER]d to one good one--when you now see
He had rather [SEQ_SPLITTER]venture all his limbs for honour
Than one on's ear[SEQ_SPLITTER]s to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e utter'd feebly. It is held
That valour is the ch[SEQ_SPLITTER]iefest virtue, and
Most dignifies the haver: if it[SEQ_SPLITTER] be,
The man I speak of cannot in the world
Be sin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
When Tarquin [SEQ_SPLITTER]made a head for Rome, he fought
Beyond the mark of[SEQ_SPLITTER] others: our then dictator,
Whom with all praise I[SEQ_SPLITTER] point at, saw him fight,
When with his Amazonian [SEQ_SPLITTER]chin he drove
The bristled lips before him: be bes[SEQ_SPLITTER]trid
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's vie[SEQ_SPLITTER]w
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
When [SEQ_SPLITTER]he might act the woman in the scene,
He proved bes[SEQ_SPLITTER]t man i' the field, and for his meed
Was brow-boun[SEQ_SPLITTER]d with the oak. His pupil age
Man-enter'd thus, he[SEQ_SPLITTER] waxed like a sea,
And in the brunt of seventeen b[SEQ_SPLITTER]attles since
He lurch'd all swords of the garland.[SEQ_SPLITTER] For this last,
Before and in Corioli, let me say,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror[SEQ_SPLITTER] into sport: as weeds before
A vessel under sail, [SEQ_SPLITTER]so men obey'd
And fell below his stem: his sword, [SEQ_SPLITTER]death's stamp,
Where it did mark, it took; from fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]tion
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
[SEQ_SPLITTER]The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
With[SEQ_SPLITTER] shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with a su[SEQ_SPLITTER]dden reinforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow all's his:
When, by and by, the din of war gan [SEQ_SPLITTER]pierce
His ready sense; then straight his doubled [SEQ_SPLITTER]spirit
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d to the battle came he; where he did
Run reeking [SEQ_SPLITTER]o'er the lives of men, as if
'Twere a perpetual sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]oil: and till we call'd
Both field and city ours, [SEQ_SPLITTER]he never stood
To ease his breast with panting.

M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENENIUS:
Worthy man!

First Senator:
He cannot but[SEQ_SPLITTER] with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

COMINIUS:
Our spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd up[SEQ_SPLITTER]on things precious as they were
The common muck of[SEQ_SPLITTER] the world: he covets less
Than misery itself woul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d give; rewards
His deeds with doing them, and is [SEQ_SPLITTER]content
To spend the time to end it.

MENENIUS:
He[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s right noble:
Let him be call'd for.

First Sena[SEQ_SPLITTER]tor:
Call Coriolanus.

Officer:
He doth appear.

M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENENIUS:
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To make thee consul.

CORIOLANUS:
I do owe them st[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill
My life and services.

MENENIUS:
It then remai[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns
That you do speak to the people.

CORIOLANUS:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] do beseech you,
Let me o'erleap that custom, for [SEQ_SPLITTER]I cannot
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat [SEQ_SPLITTER]them,
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage:[SEQ_SPLITTER] please you
That I may pass this doing.

SICINIUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Sir, the people
Must have their voices; neither w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill they bate
One jot of ceremony.

MENENIUS:
Put [SEQ_SPLITTER]them not to't:
Pray you, go fit you to the custom [SEQ_SPLITTER]and
Take to you, as your predecessors have,
Your h[SEQ_SPLITTER]onour with your form.

CORIOLANUS:
It is apart
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken[SEQ_SPLITTER] from the people.

BRUTUS:
Mark you that?

CORIOLA[SEQ_SPLITTER]NUS:
To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
Show[SEQ_SPLITTER] them the unaching scars which I should hide,
As i[SEQ_SPLITTER]f I had received them for the hire
Of their breath[SEQ_SPLITTER] only!

MENENIUS:
Do not stand upon't.
We recommen[SEQ_SPLITTER]d to you, tribunes of the people,
Our purpose to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hem: and to our noble consul
Wish we all joy and h[SEQ_SPLITTER]onour.

Senators:
To Coriolanus come all joy and h[SEQ_SPLITTER]onour!

BRUTUS:
You see how he intends to use the [SEQ_SPLITTER]people.

SICINIUS:
May they perceive's intent! He [SEQ_SPLITTER]will require them,
As if he did contemn what he re[SEQ_SPLITTER]quested
Should be in them to give.

BRUTUS:
Come, [SEQ_SPLITTER]we'll inform them
Of our proceedings here: on the [SEQ_SPLITTER]marketplace,
I know, they do attend us.

First Cit[SEQ_SPLITTER]izen:
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought [SEQ_SPLITTER]not to deny him.

Second Citizen:
We may, sir, if [SEQ_SPLITTER]we will.

Third Citizen:
We have power in ourselve[SEQ_SPLITTER]s to do it, but it is a
power that we have no powe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r to do; for if he show us
his wounds and tell us [SEQ_SPLITTER]his deeds, we are to put our
tongues into those wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]unds and speak for them; so, if
he tell us his nob[SEQ_SPLITTER]le deeds, we must also tell him
our noble acceptan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce of them. Ingratitude is
monstrous, and for the [SEQ_SPLITTER]multitude to be ingrateful,
were to make a monster[SEQ_SPLITTER] of the multitude: of the
which we being members, [SEQ_SPLITTER]should bring ourselves to be
monstrous members.

F[SEQ_SPLITTER]irst Citizen:
And to make us no better thought of,[SEQ_SPLITTER] a little help
will serve; for once we stood up ab[SEQ_SPLITTER]out the corn, he
himself stuck not to call us the [SEQ_SPLITTER]many-headed multitude.

Third Citizen:
We have bee[SEQ_SPLITTER]n called so of many; not that our heads
are some b[SEQ_SPLITTER]rown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
but that[SEQ_SPLITTER] our wits are so diversely coloured: and
truly I t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hink if all our wits were to issue out of
one skul[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, they would fly east, west, north, south,
and th[SEQ_SPLITTER]eir consent of one direct way should be at
once to[SEQ_SPLITTER] all the points o' the compass.

Second Citizen:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hink you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly?

Third Citizen:
Nay, your wit will not so soon[SEQ_SPLITTER] out as another man's
will;'tis strongly wedged up[SEQ_SPLITTER] in a block-head, but
if it were at liberty, 'twou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld, sure, southward.

Second Citizen:
Why that way[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

Third Citizen:
To lose itself in a fog, where b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eing three parts
melted away with rotten dews, the[SEQ_SPLITTER] fourth would return
for conscience sake, to help [SEQ_SPLITTER]to get thee a wife.

Second Citizen:
You are never[SEQ_SPLITTER] without your tricks: you may, you may.

Third Cit[SEQ_SPLITTER]izen:
Are you all resolved to give your voices? Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I[SEQ_SPLITTER]
say, if he would incline to the people, there was[SEQ_SPLITTER]
never a worthier man.
Here he comes, and in the g[SEQ_SPLITTER]own of humility: mark his
behavior. We are not to [SEQ_SPLITTER]stay all together, but to
come by him where he sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds, by ones, by twos, and
by threes. He's to make[SEQ_SPLITTER] his requests by
particulars; wherein every one of[SEQ_SPLITTER] us has a single
honour, in giving him our own voi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ces with our own
tongues: therefore follow me, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] I direct you how
you shall go by him.

All:
Conte[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt, content.

MENENIUS:
O sir, you are not right: [SEQ_SPLITTER]have you not known
The worthiest men have done't?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
CORIOLANUS:
What must I say?
'I Pray, sir'--Plagu[SEQ_SPLITTER]e upon't! I cannot bring
My tongue to such a pace:[SEQ_SPLITTER]--'Look, sir, my wounds!
I got them in my country'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s service, when
Some certain of your brethren roar[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d and ran
From the noise of our own drums.'

MENE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIUS:
O me, the gods!
You must not speak of that: [SEQ_SPLITTER]you must desire them
To think upon you.

CORIOLANU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Think upon me! hang 'em!
I would they would for[SEQ_SPLITTER]get me, like the virtues
Which our divines lose by[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'em.

MENENIUS:
You'll mar all:
I'll leave you: p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
In wholesome ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]nner.

CORIOLANUS:
Bid them wash their faces
And k[SEQ_SPLITTER]eep their teeth clean.
So, here comes a brace.
You[SEQ_SPLITTER] know the cause, air, of my standing here.

Third [SEQ_SPLITTER]Citizen:
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you[SEQ_SPLITTER] to't.

CORIOLANUS:
Mine own desert.

Second Citiz[SEQ_SPLITTER]en:
Your own desert!

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, but not mine[SEQ_SPLITTER] own desire.

Third Citizen:
How not your own desi[SEQ_SPLITTER]re?

CORIOLANUS:
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet[SEQ_SPLITTER] to trouble the
poor with begging.

Third Citizen:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope[SEQ_SPLITTER] to
gain by you.

CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I pray, y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our price o' the consulship?

First Citizen:
The p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rice is to ask it kindly.

CORIOLANUS:
Kindly! Sir[SEQ_SPLITTER], I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
show you, [SEQ_SPLITTER]which shall be yours in private. Your
good voice, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir; what say you?

Second Citizen:
You shall ha' [SEQ_SPLITTER]it, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS:
A match, sir. There's[SEQ_SPLITTER] in all two worthy voices
begged. I have your alms[SEQ_SPLITTER]: adieu.

Third Citizen:
But this is something odd[SEQ_SPLITTER].

Second Citizen:
An 'twere to give again,--but '[SEQ_SPLITTER]tis no matter.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray you now, if it ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y stand with the tune of your
voices that I may be[SEQ_SPLITTER] consul, I have here the
customary gown.

Fourth C[SEQ_SPLITTER]itizen:
You have deserved nobly of your country, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd you
have not deserved nobly.

CORIOLANUS:
Your [SEQ_SPLITTER]enigma?

Fourth Citizen:
You have been a scourge t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o her enemies, you have
been a rod to her friends;[SEQ_SPLITTER] you have not indeed loved
the common people.

COR[SEQ_SPLITTER]IOLANUS:
You should account me the more virtuous t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat I have
not been common in my love. I will, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER], flatter my
sworn brother, the people, to earn a [SEQ_SPLITTER]dearer
estimation of them; 'tis a condition they a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ccount
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choic[SEQ_SPLITTER]e is
rather to have my hat than my heart, I will p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ractise
the insinuating nod and be off to them mos[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit [SEQ_SPLITTER]the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]untiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] may be consul.

Fifth Citizen:
We hope to find yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u our friend; and therefore give
you our voices he[SEQ_SPLITTER]artily.

Fourth Citizen:
You have received many wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]unds for your country.

CORIOLANUS:
I will not sea[SEQ_SPLITTER]l your knowledge with showing them. I
will make mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Both Citizens:
The gods give you joy, sir, hearti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly!

CORIOLANUS:
Most sweet voices!
Better it is t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which[SEQ_SPLITTER] first we do deserve.
Why in this woolvish toge sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould I stand here,
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do[SEQ_SPLITTER] appear,
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o't:
What custom wills, in all things should we do[SEQ_SPLITTER]'t,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d mountainous error be too highly heapt
For truth [SEQ_SPLITTER]to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
Let the high[SEQ_SPLITTER] office and the honour go
To one that would do thu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s. I am half through;
The one part suffer'd, the o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther will I do.
Here come more voices.
Your voices[SEQ_SPLITTER]: for your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your [SEQ_SPLITTER]voices; for Your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen o[SEQ_SPLITTER]dd; battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of; f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or your voices have
Done many things, some less, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome more your voices:
Indeed I would be consul.

S[SEQ_SPLITTER]ixth Citizen:
He has done nobly, and cannot go wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hout any honest
man's voice.

Seventh Citizen:
The[SEQ_SPLITTER]refore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd make him good friend to the people!

All Citize[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns:
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!

CORI[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLANUS:
Worthy voices!

MENENIUS:
You have stood y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our limitation; and the tribunes
Endue you with th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e people's voice: remains
That, in the official ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]rks invested, you
Anon do meet the senate.

CORIOL[SEQ_SPLITTER]ANUS:
Is this done?

SICINIUS:
The custom of reque[SEQ_SPLITTER]st you have discharged:
The people do admit you, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbatio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.

CORIOLANUS:
Where? at the senate-house?

SICIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
There, Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS:
May I change [SEQ_SPLITTER]these garments?

SICINIUS:
You may, sir.

CORIOLAN[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]in,
Repair to the senate-house.

MENENIUS:
I'll ke[SEQ_SPLITTER]ep you company. Will you along?

BRUTUS:
We stay h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere for the people.

SICINIUS:
Fare you well.
He h[SEQ_SPLITTER]as it now, and by his looks methink
'Tis warm at '[SEQ_SPLITTER]s heart.

BRUTUS:
With a proud heart he wore his h[SEQ_SPLITTER]umble weeds.
will you dismiss the people?

SICINIU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
How now, my masters! have you chose this man?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]First Citizen:
He has our voices, sir.

BRUTUS:
We[SEQ_SPLITTER] pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

Second [SEQ_SPLITTER]Citizen:
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
He[SEQ_SPLITTER] mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

Third Citiz[SEQ_SPLITTER]en:
Certainly
He flouted us downright.

First Citi[SEQ_SPLITTER]zen:
No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock u[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.

Second Citizen:
Not one amongst us, save yours[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf, but says
He used us scornfully: he should hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds received fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's country.

SICINIUS:
Why, so he did, I am sure.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Citizens:
No, no; no man saw 'em.

Third Citizen[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
He said he had wounds, which he could show
in pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ivate;
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
But by[SEQ_SPLITTER] your voices, will not so permit me;
Your voices t[SEQ_SPLITTER]herefore.' When we granted that,
Here was 'I thank[SEQ_SPLITTER] you for your voices: thank you:
Your most sweet v[SEQ_SPLITTER]oices: now you have left
your voices,
I have no fu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rther with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Or, seeing [SEQ_SPLITTER]it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your vo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ices?

BRUTUS:
Could you not have told him
As you [SEQ_SPLITTER]were lesson'd, when he had no power,
But was a pet[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty servant to the state,
He was your enemy, ever s[SEQ_SPLITTER]pake against
Your liberties and the charters that [SEQ_SPLITTER]you bear
I' the body of the weal; and now, arrivin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
If he [SEQ_SPLITTER]should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to the pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? [SEQ_SPLITTER]You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did [SEQ_SPLITTER]claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his graci[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous nature
Would think upon you for your voices an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Stan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ding your friendly lord.

SICINIUS:
Thus to have s[SEQ_SPLITTER]aid,
As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spi[SEQ_SPLITTER]rit
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Ei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther his gracious promise, which you might,
As cau[SEQ_SPLITTER]se had call'd you up, have held him to
Or else it [SEQ_SPLITTER]would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ndures not article
Tying him to aught; so putting [SEQ_SPLITTER]him to rage,
You should have ta'en the advantage o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f his choler
And pass'd him unelected.

BRUTUS:
Di[SEQ_SPLITTER]d you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt[SEQ_SPLITTER]
When he did need your loves, and do you think
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
When [SEQ_SPLITTER]he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
No he[SEQ_SPLITTER]art among you? or had you tongues to cry
Against t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he rectorship of judgment?

SICINIUS:
Have you
Ere[SEQ_SPLITTER] now denied the asker? and now again
Of him that d[SEQ_SPLITTER]id not ask, but mock, bestow
Your sued-for tongues[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

Third Citizen:
He's not confirm'd; we may deny [SEQ_SPLITTER]him yet.

Second Citizen:
And will deny him:
I'll [SEQ_SPLITTER]have five hundred voices of that sound.

First Cit[SEQ_SPLITTER]izen:
I twice five hundred and their friends to pi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ece 'em.

BRUTUS:
Get you hence instantly, and tel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l those friends,
They have chose a consul that wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l from them take
Their liberties; make them of no [SEQ_SPLITTER]more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]rking
As therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS:
Let t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hem assemble,
And on a safer judgment all revoke
Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our ignorant election; enforce his pride,
And his [SEQ_SPLITTER]old hate unto you; besides, forget not
With what c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ontempt he wore the humble weed,
How in his suit h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ervices, took from you
The apprehension of his pre[SEQ_SPLITTER]sent portance,
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he [SEQ_SPLITTER]did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you[SEQ_SPLITTER].

BRUTUS:
Lay
A fault on us, your tribunes; that [SEQ_SPLITTER]we laboured,
No impediment between, but that you m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust
Cast your election on him.

SICINIUS:
Say, you[SEQ_SPLITTER] chose him
More after our commandment than as guid[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed
By your own true affections, and that your mind[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
Preoccupied with what you rather must do
Than w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat you should, made you against the grain
To voic[SEQ_SPLITTER]e him consul: lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS:
Ay, sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]are us not. Say we read lectures to you.
How young[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly he began to serve his country,
How long continu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed, and what stock he springs of,
The noble house [SEQ_SPLITTER]o' the Marcians, from whence came
That Ancus Marci[SEQ_SPLITTER]us, Numa's daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostil[SEQ_SPLITTER]ius, here was king;
Of the same house Publius and [SEQ_SPLITTER]Quintus were,
That our beat water brought by condu[SEQ_SPLITTER]its hither;
And  
Twice being  
Was his great ance[SEQ_SPLITTER]stor.

SICINIUS:
One thus descended,
That hath bes[SEQ_SPLITTER]ide well in his person wrought
To be set high in p[SEQ_SPLITTER]lace, we did commend
To your remembrances: but you[SEQ_SPLITTER] have found,
Scaling his present bearing with his [SEQ_SPLITTER]past,
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your [SEQ_SPLITTER]sudden approbation.

BRUTUS:
Say, you ne'er had do[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne't--
Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Re[SEQ_SPLITTER]pair to the Capitol.

All:
We will so: almost all
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Repent in their election.

BRUTUS:
Let them go on;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
This mutiny were better put in hazard,
Than stay,[SEQ_SPLITTER] past doubt, for greater:
If, as his nature is, he[SEQ_SPLITTER] fall in rage
With their refusal, both observe and[SEQ_SPLITTER] answer
The vantage of his anger.

SICINIUS:
To th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e Capitol, come:
We will be there before the strea[SEQ_SPLITTER]m o' the people;
And this shall seem, as partly 't[SEQ_SPLITTER]is, their own,
Which we have goaded onward.

CORIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LANUS:
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

LA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RTIUS:
He had, my lord; and that it was which caus[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed
Our swifter composition.

CORIOLANUS:
So then t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he Volsces stand but as at first,
Ready, when time[SEQ_SPLITTER] shall prompt them, to make road.
Upon's again.

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]OMINIUS:
They are worn, lord consul, so,
That we s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]in.

CORIOLANUS:
Saw you Aufidius?

LARTIUS:
On sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe-guard he came to me; and did curse
Against the [SEQ_SPLITTER]Volsces, for they had so vilely
Yielded the town: [SEQ_SPLITTER]he is retired to Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of [SEQ_SPLITTER]me?

LARTIUS:
He did, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
How? w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat?

LARTIUS:
How often he had met you, sword to [SEQ_SPLITTER]sword;
That of all things upon the earth he hated
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To hopeless restitution, so he might
Be call'd you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r vanquisher.

CORIOLANUS:
At Antium lives he?

LA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RTIUS:
At Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
I wish I had a caus[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully. W[SEQ_SPLITTER]elcome home.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the[SEQ_SPLITTER] people,
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do des[SEQ_SPLITTER]pise them;
For they do prank them in authority,
Ag[SEQ_SPLITTER]ainst all noble sufferance.

SICINIUS:
Pass no fur[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther.

CORIOLANUS:
Ha! what is that?

BRUTUS:
It w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill be dangerous to go on: no further.

CORIOLANUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
What makes this change?

MENENIUS:
The matter?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]COMINIUS:
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the com[SEQ_SPLITTER]mon?

BRUTUS:
Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS:
Have I ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]d children's voices?

First Senator:
Tribunes, giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e way; he shall to the market-place.

BRUTUS:
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]people are incensed against him.

SICINIUS:
Stop,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Or all will fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS:
Are these [SEQ_SPLITTER]your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield [SEQ_SPLITTER]them now
And straight disclaim their tongues? What[SEQ_SPLITTER] are
your offices?
You being their mouths, why rul[SEQ_SPLITTER]e you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MENENIUS:
Be calm, be calm.

CORIOLANUS:
It is a p[SEQ_SPLITTER]urposed thing, and grows by plot,
To curb the will[SEQ_SPLITTER] of the nobility:
Suffer't, and live with such as [SEQ_SPLITTER]cannot rule
Nor ever will be ruled.

BRUTUS:
Call'[SEQ_SPLITTER]t not a plot:
The people cry you mock'd them, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ned;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to noblene[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss.

CORIOLANUS:
Why, this was known before.

BRUT[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
Not to them all.

CORIOLANUS:
Have you inform'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d them sithence?

BRUTUS:
How! I inform them!

COR[SEQ_SPLITTER]IOLANUS:
You are like to do such business.

BRUTUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Not unlike,
Each way, to better yours.

CORIOLAN[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
L[SEQ_SPLITTER]et me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Your fell[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow tribune.

SICINIUS:
You show too much of that
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or which the people stir: if you will pass
To wher[SEQ_SPLITTER]e you are bound, you must inquire your way,
Which [SEQ_SPLITTER]you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Or never be[SEQ_SPLITTER] so noble as a consul,
Nor yoke with him for tribu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne.

MENENIUS:
Let's be calm.

COMINIUS:
The peopl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e are abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes not R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome, nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d rub, laid falsely
I' the plain way of his merit[SEQ_SPLITTER].

CORIOLANUS:
Tell me of corn!
This was my speech[SEQ_SPLITTER], and I will speak't again--

MENENIUS:
Not now, n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot now.

First Senator:
Not in this heat, sir, now[SEQ_SPLITTER].

CORIOLANUS:
Now, as I live, I will. My nobler f[SEQ_SPLITTER]riends,
I crave their pardons:
For the mutable, ra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nk-scented many, let them
Regard me as I do not fl[SEQ_SPLITTER]atter, and
Therein behold themselves: I say again,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which[SEQ_SPLITTER] we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
and scatte[SEQ_SPLITTER]r'd,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch they have given to beggars.

MENENIUS:
Well, no[SEQ_SPLITTER] more.

First Senator:
No more words, we beseech y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou.

CORIOLANUS:
How! no more!
As for my country I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so[SEQ_SPLITTER] shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay agains[SEQ_SPLITTER]t those measles,
Which we disdain should tatter us[SEQ_SPLITTER], yet sought
The very way to catch them.

BRUTUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]You speak o' the people,
As if you were a god to p[SEQ_SPLITTER]unish, not
A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS:
'T[SEQ_SPLITTER]were well
We let the people know't.

MENENIUS:
Wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, what? his choler?

CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould [SEQ_SPLITTER]be my mind!

SICINIUS:
It is a mind
That shall rem[SEQ_SPLITTER]ain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
CORIOLANUS:
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of[SEQ_SPLITTER] the minnows? mark you
His absolute 'shall'?

COMI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIUS:
'Twas from the canon.

CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]O good but most unwise patricians! why,
You grave [SEQ_SPLITTER]but reckless senators, have you thus
Given Hydra h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere to choose an officer,
That with his peremptory[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'shall,' being but
The horn and noise o' the mons[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter's, wants not spirit
To say he'll turn your cur[SEQ_SPLITTER]rent in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If he [SEQ_SPLITTER]have power
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t as common fools; if you are not,
Let them have c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ushions by you. You are plebeians,
If they be sena[SEQ_SPLITTER]tors: and they are no less,
When, both your voices[SEQ_SPLITTER] blended, the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. [SEQ_SPLITTER]They choose their magistrate,
And such a one as he[SEQ_SPLITTER], who puts his 'shall,'
His popular 'shall' agains[SEQ_SPLITTER]t a graver bench
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e himself!
It makes the consuls base: and my soul [SEQ_SPLITTER]aches
To know, when two authorities are up,
Neithe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r supreme, how soon confusion
May enter 'twixt the[SEQ_SPLITTER] gap of both and take
The one by the other.

COMIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
Well, on to the market-place.

CORIOLANUS:
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]oever gave that counsel, to give forth
The corn o'[SEQ_SPLITTER] the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in [SEQ_SPLITTER]Greece,--

MENENIUS:
Well, well, no more of that.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
CORIOLANUS:
Though there the people had more abso[SEQ_SPLITTER]lute power,
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fe[SEQ_SPLITTER]d
The ruin of the state.

BRUTUS:
Why, shall the p[SEQ_SPLITTER]eople give
One that speaks thus their voice?

CORI[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLANUS:
I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than t[SEQ_SPLITTER]heir voices. They know the corn
Was not our recomp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ense, resting well assured
That ne'er did service [SEQ_SPLITTER]for't: being press'd to the war,
Even when the nav[SEQ_SPLITTER]el of the state was touch'd,
They would not thread[SEQ_SPLITTER] the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve c[SEQ_SPLITTER]orn gratis. Being i' the war
Their mutinies and re[SEQ_SPLITTER]volts, wherein they show'd
Most valour, spoke not [SEQ_SPLITTER]for them: the accusation
Which they have often mad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e against the senate,
All cause unborn, could neve[SEQ_SPLITTER]r be the motive
Of our so frank donation. Well, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at then?
How shall this bisson multitude digest
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
What's like[SEQ_SPLITTER] to be their words: 'we did request it;
We are the[SEQ_SPLITTER] greater poll, and in true fear
They gave us our d[SEQ_SPLITTER]emands.' Thus we debase
The nature of our seats an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will[SEQ_SPLITTER] in time
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng in
The crows to peck the eagles.

MENENIUS:
Com[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, enough.

BRUTUS:
Enough, with over-measure.

CO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RIOLANUS:
No, take more:
What may be sworn by, bot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ouble worship,
Where one part does disdain with ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]use, the other
Insult without all reason, where ge[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]a and no
Of general ignorance,--it must omit
Real [SEQ_SPLITTER]necessities, and give way the while
To unstable sl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ightness: purpose so barr'd,
it follows,
Nothing i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
You t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat will be less fearful than discreet,
That love [SEQ_SPLITTER]the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt [SEQ_SPLITTER]the change on't, that prefer
A noble life before a[SEQ_SPLITTER] long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous ph[SEQ_SPLITTER]ysic
That's sure of death without it, at once pluc[SEQ_SPLITTER]k out
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
[SEQ_SPLITTER]The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
Ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngles true judgment and bereaves the state
Of that[SEQ_SPLITTER] integrity which should become't,
Not having the p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ower to do the good it would,
For the in which dot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h control't.

BRUTUS:
Has said enough.

SICINIUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
As tra[SEQ_SPLITTER]itors do.

CORIOLANUS:
Thou wretch, despite o'erwh[SEQ_SPLITTER]elm thee!
What should the people do with these bal[SEQ_SPLITTER]d tribunes?
On whom depending, their obedience fai[SEQ_SPLITTER]ls
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
When what[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s not meet, but what must be, was law,
Then were [SEQ_SPLITTER]they chosen: in a better hour,
Let what is meet be[SEQ_SPLITTER] said it must be meet,
And throw their power i' th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e dust.

BRUTUS:
Manifest treason!

SICINIUS:
This[SEQ_SPLITTER] a consul? no.

BRUTUS:
The aediles, ho!
Let him b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e apprehended.

SICINIUS:
Go, call the people:
in [SEQ_SPLITTER]whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous inno[SEQ_SPLITTER]vator,
A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee,
And follow to thine answer.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence[SEQ_SPLITTER], old goat!

Senators, &C:
We'll surety him.

COMI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, rot[SEQ_SPLITTER]ten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy g[SEQ_SPLITTER]arments.

SICINIUS:
Help, ye citizens!

MENENIUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]On both sides more respect.

SICINIUS:
Here's he t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat would take from you all your power.

BRUTUS:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]eize him, AEdiles!

Citizens:
Down with him! down [SEQ_SPLITTER]with him!

Senators, &C:
Weapons, weapons, weapons[SEQ_SPLITTER]!
'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho![SEQ_SPLITTER]'
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
[SEQ_SPLITTER]'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'

MENEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
What is about to be? I am out of breath;
Conf[SEQ_SPLITTER]usion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
To the[SEQ_SPLITTER] people! Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Siciniu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.

SICINIUS:
Hear me, people; peace!

Citizens:
L[SEQ_SPLITTER]et's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
SICINIUS:
You are at point to lose your liberties[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
Whom l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate you have named for consul.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie[SEQ_SPLITTER], fie!
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]First Senator:
To unbuild the city and to lay all [SEQ_SPLITTER]flat.

SICINIUS:
What is the city but the people?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Citizens:
True,
The people are the city.

BRUTUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
By the consent of all, we were establish'd
The pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ople's magistrates.

Citizens:
You so remain.

MEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENIUS:
And so are like to do.

COMINIUS:
That is t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he way to lay the city flat;
To bring the roof to [SEQ_SPLITTER]the foundation,
And bury all, which yet distinctly[SEQ_SPLITTER] ranges,
In heaps and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is deserves death.

BRUTUS:
Or let us stand to our[SEQ_SPLITTER] authority,
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
We [SEQ_SPLITTER]were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
Of present [SEQ_SPLITTER]death.

SICINIUS:
Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear [SEQ_SPLITTER]him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
Into des[SEQ_SPLITTER]truction cast him.

BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him!

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]itizens:
Yield, Marcius, yield!

MENENIUS:
Hear me[SEQ_SPLITTER] one word;
Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd.

AEdile:
Peace, peace!

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
Sir[SEQ_SPLITTER], those cold ways,
That seem like prudent helps, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]re very poisonous
Where the disease is violent. La[SEQ_SPLITTER]y hands upon him,
And bear him to the rock.

CORIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LANUS:
No, I'll die here.
There's some among you h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave beheld me fighting:
Come, try upon yourselves [SEQ_SPLITTER]what you have seen me.

MENENIUS:
Down with that s[SEQ_SPLITTER]word! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

BRUTUS:
Lay hand[SEQ_SPLITTER]s upon him.

COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t be noble; help him, young and old!

Citizens:
Do[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn with him, down with him!

MENENIUS:
Go, get you[SEQ_SPLITTER] to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught [SEQ_SPLITTER]else.

Second Senator:
Get you gone.

COMINIUS:
St[SEQ_SPLITTER]and fast;
We have as many friends as enemies.

MEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENIUS:
Sham it be put to that?

First Senator:
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] gods forbid!
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] house;
Leave us to cure this cause.

MENENIUS:
Fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r 'tis a sore upon us,
You cannot tent yourself: b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e gone, beseech you.

COMINIUS:
Come, sir, along w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith us.

CORIOLANUS:
I would they were barbarians-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-as they are,
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-as they are not,
Though calved i' the porch o' th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e Capitol--

MENENIUS:
Be gone;
Put not your worth[SEQ_SPLITTER]y rage into your tongue;
One time will owe another[SEQ_SPLITTER].

CORIOLANUS:
On fair ground
I could beat forty o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f them.

COMINIUS:
I could myself
Take up a brace [SEQ_SPLITTER]o' the best of them; yea, the
two tribunes:
But no[SEQ_SPLITTER]w 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
And manhood is call[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d foolery, when it stands
Against a falling fabri[SEQ_SPLITTER]c. Will you hence,
Before the tag return? whose ra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ge doth rend
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
[SEQ_SPLITTER]What they are used to bear.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e gone:
I'll try whether my old wit be in request
[SEQ_SPLITTER]With those that have but little: this must be patc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h'd
With cloth of any colour.

COMINIUS:
Nay, come[SEQ_SPLITTER] away.

A Patrician:
This man has marr'd his fortu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne.

MENENIUS:
His nature is too noble for the wor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld:
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uth:
What his breast forges, that his tongue must [SEQ_SPLITTER]vent;
And, being angry, does forget that ever
He h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eard the name of death.
Here's goodly work!

Secon[SEQ_SPLITTER]d Patrician:
I would they were abed!

MENENIUS:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
Coul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d he not speak 'em fair?

SICINIUS:
Where is this [SEQ_SPLITTER]viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every [SEQ_SPLITTER]man himself?

MENENIUS:
You worthy tribunes,--

SI[SEQ_SPLITTER]CINIUS:
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
[SEQ_SPLITTER]With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
And the[SEQ_SPLITTER]refore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the [SEQ_SPLITTER]severity of the public power
Which he so sets at n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ought.

First Citizen:
He shall well know
The nobl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e tribunes are the people's mouths,
And we their h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ands.

Citizens:
He shall, sure on't.

MENENIUS:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir, sir,--

SICINIUS:
Peace!

MENENIUS:
Do not cry[SEQ_SPLITTER] havoc, where you should but hunt
With modest warr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ant.

SICINIUS:
Sir, how comes't that you
Have hol[SEQ_SPLITTER]p to make this rescue?

MENENIUS:
Hear me speak:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]s I do know the consul's worthiness,
So can I name[SEQ_SPLITTER] his faults,--

SICINIUS:
Consul! what consul?

ME[SEQ_SPLITTER]NENIUS:
The consul Coriolanus.

BRUTUS:
He consul![SEQ_SPLITTER]

Citizens:
No, no, no, no, no.

MENENIUS:
If, by [SEQ_SPLITTER]the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
I may[SEQ_SPLITTER] be heard, I would crave a word or two;
The which [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall turn you to no further harm
Than so much los[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of time.

SICINIUS:
Speak briefly then;
For we a[SEQ_SPLITTER]re peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor: t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o eject him hence
Were but one danger, and to keep[SEQ_SPLITTER] him here
Our certain death: therefore it is decre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed
He dies to-night.

MENENIUS:
Now the good gods [SEQ_SPLITTER]forbid
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
Tow[SEQ_SPLITTER]ards her deserved children is enroll'd
In Jove's o[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn book, like an unnatural dam
Should now eat up h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er own!

SICINIUS:
He's a disease that must be cut[SEQ_SPLITTER] away.

MENENIUS:
O, he's a limb that has but a di[SEQ_SPLITTER]sease;
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
Which, I d[SEQ_SPLITTER]are vouch, is more than that he hath,
By many an o[SEQ_SPLITTER]unce--he dropp'd it for his country;
And what is l[SEQ_SPLITTER]eft, to lose it by his country,
Were to us all, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at do't and suffer it,
A brand to the end o' the w[SEQ_SPLITTER]orld.

SICINIUS:
This is clean kam.

BRUTUS:
Merel[SEQ_SPLITTER]y awry: when he did love his country,
It honour'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]him.

MENENIUS:
The service of the foot
Being once[SEQ_SPLITTER] gangrened, is not then respected
For what before [SEQ_SPLITTER]it was.

BRUTUS:
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to[SEQ_SPLITTER] his house, and pluck him thence:
Lest his infecti[SEQ_SPLITTER]on, being of catching nature,
Spread further.

MEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENIUS:
One word more, one word.
This tiger-footed [SEQ_SPLITTER]rage, when it shall find
The harm of unscann'd swi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ftness, will too late
Tie leaden pounds to's heels[SEQ_SPLITTER]. Proceed by process;
Lest parties, as he is belov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed, break out,
And sack great Rome with Romans.

B[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUTUS:
If it were so,--

SICINIUS:
What do ye talk[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Our ae[SEQ_SPLITTER]diles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.

MENENIUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
Since [SEQ_SPLITTER]he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
In bolt[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed language; meal and bran together
He throws with[SEQ_SPLITTER]out distinction. Give me leave,
I'll go to him, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d undertake to bring him
Where he shall answer, by[SEQ_SPLITTER] a lawful form,
In peace, to his utmost peril.

Fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]rst Senator:
Noble tribunes,
It is the humane way:[SEQ_SPLITTER] the other course
Will prove too bloody, and the e[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd of it
Unknown to the beginning.

SICINIUS:
Nobl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e Menenius,
Be you then as the people's officer.
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]asters, lay down your weapons.

BRUTUS:
Go not hom[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

SICINIUS:
Meet on the market-place. We'll atte[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd you there:
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll proceed
In our first way.

MENENIUS:
I'll bring[SEQ_SPLITTER] him to you.
Let me desire your company: he must c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome,
Or what is worst will follow.

First Senator:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Pray you, let's to him.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them puf[SEQ_SPLITTER]f all about mine ears, present me
Death on the whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]el or at wild horses' heels,
Or pile ten hills on [SEQ_SPLITTER]the Tarpeian rock,
That the precipitation might do[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn stretch
Below the beam of sight, yet will I sti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll
Be thus to them.

A Patrician:
You do the noble[SEQ_SPLITTER]r.

CORIOLANUS:
I muse my mother
Does not approve [SEQ_SPLITTER]me further, who was wont
To call them woollen vass[SEQ_SPLITTER]als, things created
To buy and sell with groats, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o show bare heads
In congregations, to yawn, be st[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill and wonder,
When one but of my ordinance stood[SEQ_SPLITTER] up
To speak of peace or war.
I talk of you:
Why d[SEQ_SPLITTER]id you wish me milder? would you have me
False to [SEQ_SPLITTER]my nature? Rather say I play
The man I am.

VOLUMN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IA:
O, sir, sir, sir,
I would have had you put you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r power well on,
Before you had worn it out.

CORI[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLANUS:
Let go.

VOLUMNIA:
You might have been eno[SEQ_SPLITTER]ugh the man you are,
With striving less to be so; [SEQ_SPLITTER]lesser had been
The thwartings of your disposition[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, if
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Ere they lack'd power to cross you.

CORIOLANUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Let them hang.

A Patrician:
Ay, and burn too.

ME[SEQ_SPLITTER]NENIUS:
Come, come, you have been too rough, somet[SEQ_SPLITTER]hing
too rough;
You must return and mend it.

Firs[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Senator:
There's no remedy;
Unless, by not so do[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing, our good city
Cleave in the midst, and perish[SEQ_SPLITTER].

VOLUMNIA:
Pray, be counsell'd:
I have a heart a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s little apt as yours,
But yet a brain that leads [SEQ_SPLITTER]my use of anger
To better vantage.

MENENIUS:
Well[SEQ_SPLITTER] said, noble woman?
Before he should thus stoop to[SEQ_SPLITTER] the herd, but that
The violent fit o' the time cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]aves it as physic
For the whole state, I would put[SEQ_SPLITTER] mine armour on,
Which I can scarcely bear.

CORIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LANUS:
What must I do?

MENENIUS:
Return to the tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ibunes.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, what then? what then?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MENENIUS:
Repent what you have spoke.

CORIOLANUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then[SEQ_SPLITTER] do't to them?

VOLUMNIA:
You are too absolute;
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ough therein you can never be too noble,
But when [SEQ_SPLITTER]extremities speak. I have heard you say,
Honour an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d policy, like unsever'd friends,
I' the war do gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow together: grant that, and tell me,
In peace wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t each of them by the other lose,
That they combin[SEQ_SPLITTER]e not there.

CORIOLANUS:
Tush, tush!

MENENIUS:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER] good demand.

VOLUMNIA:
If it be honour in your w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ars to seem
The same you are not, which, for your [SEQ_SPLITTER]best ends,
You adopt your policy, how is it less o[SEQ_SPLITTER]r worse,
That it shall hold companionship in peace[SEQ_SPLITTER]
With honour, as in war, since that to both
It sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds in like request?

CORIOLANUS:
Why force you th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is?

VOLUMNIA:
Because that now it lies you on to [SEQ_SPLITTER]speak
To the people; not by your own instruction,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t with such words that are but rooted in
Your tong[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue, though but bastards and syllables
Of no allowa[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce to your bosom's truth.
Now, this no more disho[SEQ_SPLITTER]nours you at all
Than to take in a town with gentl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e words,
Which else would put you to your fortune [SEQ_SPLITTER]and
The hazard of much blood.
I would dissemble wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th my nature where
My fortunes and my friends at s[SEQ_SPLITTER]take required
I should do so in honour: I am in th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is,
Your wife, your son, these senators, the noble[SEQ_SPLITTER]s;
And you will rather show our general louts
How [SEQ_SPLITTER]you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
For the [SEQ_SPLITTER]inheritance of their loves and safeguard
Of what t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat want might ruin.

MENENIUS:
Noble lady!
Come, [SEQ_SPLITTER]go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
Not what[SEQ_SPLITTER] is dangerous present, but the loss
Of what is pas[SEQ_SPLITTER]t.

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, my son,
Go to them, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith this bonnet in thy hand;
And thus far having s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tretch'd it--here be with them--
Thy knee bussing [SEQ_SPLITTER]the stones--for in such business
Action is eloquen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce, and the eyes of the ignorant
More learned than[SEQ_SPLITTER] the ears--waving thy head,
Which often, thus, cor[SEQ_SPLITTER]recting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest [SEQ_SPLITTER]mulberry
That will not hold the handling: or say t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o them,
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in [SEQ_SPLITTER]broils
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost conf[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess,
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
In[SEQ_SPLITTER] asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
Thys[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
As thou ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]st power and person.

MENENIUS:
This but done,
Eve[SEQ_SPLITTER]n as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
As words [SEQ_SPLITTER]to little purpose.

VOLUMNIA:
Prithee now,
Go, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
Follo[SEQ_SPLITTER]w thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in [SEQ_SPLITTER]a bower. Here is Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I have been [SEQ_SPLITTER]i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
You make st[SEQ_SPLITTER]rong party, or defend yourself
By calmness or by a[SEQ_SPLITTER]bsence: all's in anger.

MENENIUS:
Only fair speec[SEQ_SPLITTER]h.

COMINIUS:
I think 'twill serve, if he
Can ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]eto frame his spirit.

VOLUMNIA:
He must, and will[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

CORI[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLANUS:
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]st I with base tongue give my noble heart
A lie th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at it must bear? Well, I will do't:
Yet, were ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Marc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ius, they to dust should grind it
And throw't agai[SEQ_SPLITTER]nst the wind. To the market-place!
You have put me[SEQ_SPLITTER] now to such a part which never
I shall discharge [SEQ_SPLITTER]to the life.

COMINIUS:
Come, come, we'll prompt y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou.

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, sweet son, as thou h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ast said
My praises made thee first a soldier, so,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To have my praise for this, perform a part
Thou h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ast not done before.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, I must do'[SEQ_SPLITTER]t:
Away, my disposition, and possess me
Some harlo[SEQ_SPLITTER]t's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
Which quir[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed with my drum, into a pipe
Small as an eunuch, o[SEQ_SPLITTER]r the virgin voice
That babies lulls asleep! the s[SEQ_SPLITTER]miles of knaves
Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys'[SEQ_SPLITTER] tears take up
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's[SEQ_SPLITTER] tongue
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]knees,
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
[SEQ_SPLITTER]That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
Lest [SEQ_SPLITTER]I surcease to honour mine own truth
And by my body[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s action teach my mind
A most inherent baseness.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
VOLUMNIA:
At thy choice, then:
To beg of thee, it[SEQ_SPLITTER] is my more dishonour
Than thou of them. Come all [SEQ_SPLITTER]to ruin; let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than[SEQ_SPLITTER] fear
Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death[SEQ_SPLITTER]
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
Thy va[SEQ_SPLITTER]liantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]owe thy pride thyself.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray, be conte[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt:
Mother, I am going to the market-place;
Chide [SEQ_SPLITTER]me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
Cog their[SEQ_SPLITTER] hearts from them, and come home beloved
Of all th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
Commend me to [SEQ_SPLITTER]my wife. I'll return consul;
Or never trust to wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t my tongue can do
I' the way of flattery further.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

VOLUMNIA:
Do your will.

COMINIUS:
Away! the tri[SEQ_SPLITTER]bunes do attend you: arm yourself
To answer mildly[SEQ_SPLITTER]; for they are prepared
With accusations, as I hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, more strong
Than are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
Let th[SEQ_SPLITTER]em accuse me by invention, I
Will answer in mine h[SEQ_SPLITTER]onour.

MENENIUS:
Ay, but mildly.

CORIOLANUS:
Wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, mildly be it then. Mildly!

BRUTUS:
In this poi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt charge him home, that he affects
Tyrannical pow[SEQ_SPLITTER]er: if he evade us there,
Enforce him with his env[SEQ_SPLITTER]y to the people,
And that the spoil got on the Ant[SEQ_SPLITTER]iates
Was ne'er distributed.
What, will he come?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]AEdile:
He's coming.

BRUTUS:
How accompanied?

AE[SEQ_SPLITTER]dile:
With old Menenius, and those senators
That a[SEQ_SPLITTER]lways favour'd him.

SICINIUS:
Have you a catalogu[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Of all the voices that we have procured
Set down[SEQ_SPLITTER] by the poll?

AEdile:
I have; 'tis ready.

SICINI[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
Have you collected them by tribes?

AEdile:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]have.

SICINIUS:
Assemble presently the people hit[SEQ_SPLITTER]her;
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
I' [SEQ_SPLITTER]the right and strength o' the commons,' be it eith[SEQ_SPLITTER]er
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let th[SEQ_SPLITTER]em
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death[SEQ_SPLITTER].'
Insisting on the old prerogative
And power i' t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he truth o' the cause.

AEdile:
I shall inform the[SEQ_SPLITTER]m.

BRUTUS:
And when such time they have begun to [SEQ_SPLITTER]cry,
Let them not cease, but with a din confused
E[SEQ_SPLITTER]nforce the present execution
Of what we chance to [SEQ_SPLITTER]sentence.

AEdile:
Very well.

SICINIUS:
Make them[SEQ_SPLITTER] be strong and ready for this hint,
When we shall [SEQ_SPLITTER]hap to give 't them.

BRUTUS:
Go about it.
Put him[SEQ_SPLITTER] to choler straight: he hath been used
Ever to con[SEQ_SPLITTER]quer, and to have his worth
Of contradiction: bein[SEQ_SPLITTER]g once chafed, he cannot
Be rein'd again to temper[SEQ_SPLITTER]ance; then he speaks
What's in his heart; and that[SEQ_SPLITTER] is there which looks
With us to break his neck.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]SICINIUS:
Well, here he comes.

MENENIUS:
Calmly, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I do beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an ostler, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat for the poorest piece
Will bear the knave by t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he volume. The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in safety, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and the chairs of justice
Supplied with worthy men[SEQ_SPLITTER]! plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th the shows of peace,
And not our streets with wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]r!

First Senator:
Amen, amen.

MENENIUS:
A noble [SEQ_SPLITTER]wish.

SICINIUS:
Draw near, ye people.

AEdile:
Li[SEQ_SPLITTER]st to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!

CORI[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLANUS:
First, hear me speak.

Both Tribunes:
Well[SEQ_SPLITTER], say. Peace, ho!

CORIOLANUS:
Shall I be charged [SEQ_SPLITTER]no further than this present?
Must all determine h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere?

SICINIUS:
I do demand,
If you submit you to [SEQ_SPLITTER]the people's voices,
Allow their officers and are [SEQ_SPLITTER]content
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]s shall be proved upon you?

CORIOLANUS:
I am cont[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent.

MENENIUS:
Lo, citizens, he says he is conten[SEQ_SPLITTER]t:
The warlike service he has done, consider; thin[SEQ_SPLITTER]k
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
Like [SEQ_SPLITTER]graves i' the holy churchyard.

CORIOLANUS:
Scratc[SEQ_SPLITTER]hes with briers,
Scars to move laughter only.

MEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENIUS:
Consider further,
That when he speaks not l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ike a citizen,
You find him like a soldier: do not[SEQ_SPLITTER] take
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, as I say, such as become a soldier,
Rather than[SEQ_SPLITTER] envy you.

COMINIUS:
Well, well, no more.

CORIOL[SEQ_SPLITTER]ANUS:
What is the matter
That being pass'd for con[SEQ_SPLITTER]sul with full voice,
I am so dishonour'd that the [SEQ_SPLITTER]very hour
You take it off again?

SICINIUS:
Answer[SEQ_SPLITTER] to us.

CORIOLANUS:
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought[SEQ_SPLITTER] so.

SICINIUS:
We charge you, that you have contr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ived to take
From Rome all season'd office and to [SEQ_SPLITTER]wind
Yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou are a traitor to the people.

CORIOLANUS:
How! [SEQ_SPLITTER]traitor!

MENENIUS:
Nay, temperately; your promise[SEQ_SPLITTER].

CORIOLANUS:
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the people!
Call me their traitor! Thou injuriou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s tribune!
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaths,
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
'Thou li[SEQ_SPLITTER]est' unto thee with a voice as free
As I do pray t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he gods.

SICINIUS:
Mark you this, people?

Citize[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns:
To the rock, to the rock with him!

SICINIUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Peace!
We need not put new matter to his charge:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat you have seen him do and heard him speak,
Beat[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing your officers, cursing yourselves,
Opposing la[SEQ_SPLITTER]ws with strokes and here defying
Those whose great[SEQ_SPLITTER] power must try him; even this,
So criminal and in[SEQ_SPLITTER] such capital kind,
Deserves the extremest death.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BRUTUS:
But since he hath
Served well for Rome,--[SEQ_SPLITTER]

CORIOLANUS:
What do you prate of service?

BRUTU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
I talk of that, that know it.

CORIOLANUS:
You?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

MENENIUS:
Is this the promise that you made your[SEQ_SPLITTER] mother?

COMINIUS:
Know, I pray you,--

CORIOLANU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
I know no further:
Let them pronounce the steep[SEQ_SPLITTER] Tarpeian death,
Vagabond exile, raying, pent to l[SEQ_SPLITTER]inger
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
Thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r mercy at the price of one fair word;
Nor cheque [SEQ_SPLITTER]my courage for what they can give,
To have't with [SEQ_SPLITTER]saying 'Good morrow.'

SICINIUS:
For that he has,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]As much as in him lies, from time to time
Envied a[SEQ_SPLITTER]gainst the people, seeking means
To pluck away the[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir power, as now at last
Given hostile strokes, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d that not in the presence
Of dreaded justice, but[SEQ_SPLITTER] on the ministers
That do distribute it; in the na[SEQ_SPLITTER]me o' the people
And in the power of us the tribun[SEQ_SPLITTER]es, we,
Even from this instant, banish him our cit[SEQ_SPLITTER]y,
In peril of precipitation
From off the rock Tar[SEQ_SPLITTER]peian never more
To enter our Rome gates: i' the p[SEQ_SPLITTER]eople's name,
I say it shall be so.

Citizens:
It [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
He's ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]nish'd, and it shall be so.

COMINIUS:
Hear me, my[SEQ_SPLITTER] masters, and my common friends,--

SICINIUS:
He's[SEQ_SPLITTER] sentenced; no more hearing.

COMINIUS:
Let me spe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ak:
I have been consul, and can show for Rome
Her [SEQ_SPLITTER]enemies' marks upon me. I do love
My country's goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d with a respect more tender,
More holy and profou[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, than mine own life,
My dear wife's estimate, h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er womb's increase,
And treasure of my loins; then[SEQ_SPLITTER] if I would
Speak that,--

SICINIUS:
We know your [SEQ_SPLITTER]drift: speak what?

BRUTUS:
There's no more to be [SEQ_SPLITTER]said, but he is banish'd,
As enemy to the people a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd his country:
It shall be so.

Citizens:
It shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be so, it shall be so.

CORIOLANUS:
You common c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry of curs! whose breath I hate
As reek o' the rot[SEQ_SPLITTER]ten fens, whose loves I prize
As the dead carcasse[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of unburied men
That do corrupt my air, I banish[SEQ_SPLITTER] you;
And here remain with your uncertainty!
Let e[SEQ_SPLITTER]very feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemies[SEQ_SPLITTER], with nodding of their plumes,
Fan you into despa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir! Have the power still
To banish your defenders;[SEQ_SPLITTER] till at length
Your ignorance, which finds not ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll it feels,
Making not reservation of yourselves,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
Abated c[SEQ_SPLITTER]aptives to some nation
That won you without blows![SEQ_SPLITTER] Despising,
For you, the city, thus I turn my back[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
There is a world elsewhere.

AEdile:
The people'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s enemy is gone, is gone!

Citizens:
Our enemy is [SEQ_SPLITTER]banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!

SICINIUS:
Go, see[SEQ_SPLITTER] him out at gates, and follow him,
As he hath foll[SEQ_SPLITTER]owed you, with all despite;
Give him deserved vexa[SEQ_SPLITTER]tion. Let a guard
Attend us through the city.

Cit[SEQ_SPLITTER]izens:
Come, come; let's see him out at gates; com[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.

CO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RIOLANUS:
Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell[SEQ_SPLITTER]: the beast
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther,
Where is your ancient courage? you were used[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
That c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ommon chances common men could bear;
That when the[SEQ_SPLITTER] sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in[SEQ_SPLITTER] floating; fortune's blows,
When most struck home,[SEQ_SPLITTER] being gentle wounded, craves
A noble cunning: you[SEQ_SPLITTER] were used to load me
With precepts that would mak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e invincible
The heart that conn'd them.

VIRGILIA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
O heavens! O heavens!

CORIOLANUS:
Nay! prithee,[SEQ_SPLITTER] woman,--

VOLUMNIA:
Now the red pestilence strike[SEQ_SPLITTER] all trades in Rome,
And occupations perish!

CORI[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLANUS:
What, what, what!
I shall be loved when I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am lack'd. Nay, mother.
Resume that spirit, when y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou were wont to say,
If you had been the wife of H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ercules,
Six of his labours you'ld have done, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]saved
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
Droop [SEQ_SPLITTER]not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
I'll do [SEQ_SPLITTER]well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy tears ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e salter than a younger man's,
And venomous to thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne eyes. My sometime general,
I have seen thee ste[SEQ_SPLITTER]m, and thou hast oft beheld
Heart-hardening specta[SEQ_SPLITTER]cles; tell these sad women
'Tis fond to wail inevi[SEQ_SPLITTER]table strokes,
As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother,[SEQ_SPLITTER] you wot well
My hazards still have been your sola[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce: and
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
Makes fear'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] and talk'd of more than seen--your son
Will or ex[SEQ_SPLITTER]ceed the common or be caught
With cautelous baits [SEQ_SPLITTER]and practise.

VOLUMNIA:
My first son.
Whither wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thou go? Take good Cominius
With thee awhile: de[SEQ_SPLITTER]termine on some course,
More than a wild exposture[SEQ_SPLITTER] to each chance
That starts i' the way before thee[SEQ_SPLITTER].

CORIOLANUS:
O the gods!

COMINIUS:
I'll follow [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee a month, devise with thee
Where thou shalt re[SEQ_SPLITTER]st, that thou mayst hear of us
And we of thee: so [SEQ_SPLITTER]if the time thrust forth
A cause for thy repeal, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]e shall not send
O'er the vast world to seek a sin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gle man,
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I' the absence of the needer.

CORIOLANUS:
Fare ye[SEQ_SPLITTER] well:
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too[SEQ_SPLITTER] full
Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
Com[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
My friend[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of noble touch, when I am forth,
Bid me farewell[SEQ_SPLITTER], and smile. I pray you, come.
While I remain abov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e the ground, you shall
Hear from me still, and ne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ver of me aught
But what is like me formerly.

MEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENIUS:
That's worthily
As any ear can hear. Come, [SEQ_SPLITTER]let's not weep.
If I could shake off but one seven[SEQ_SPLITTER] years
From these old arms and legs, by the good g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ods,
I'ld with thee every foot.

CORIOLANUS:
Give [SEQ_SPLITTER]me thy hand: Come.

SICINIUS:
Bid them all home; h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e's gone, and we'll no further.
The nobility are v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ex'd, whom we see have sided
In his behalf.

BRUTU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Now we have shown our power,
Let us seem humble[SEQ_SPLITTER]r after it is done
Than when it was a-doing.

SICI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIUS:
Bid them home:
Say their great enemy is gone[SEQ_SPLITTER], and they
Stand in their ancient strength.

BRUTU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Dismiss them home.
Here comes his mother.

SICI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIUS:
Let's not meet her.

BRUTUS:
Why?

SICINIUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
They say she's mad.

BRUTUS:
They have ta'en note[SEQ_SPLITTER] of us: keep on your way.

VOLUMNIA:
O, ye're well[SEQ_SPLITTER] met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
Requite your [SEQ_SPLITTER]love!

MENENIUS:
Peace, peace; be not so loud.

VO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LUMNIA:
If that I could for weeping, you should he[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar,--
Nay, and you shall hear some.
Will you be go[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne?

VIRGILIA:

SICINIUS:
Are you mankind?

VOLUMN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IA:
Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
To ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]nish him that struck more blows for Rome
Than thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] hast spoken words?

SICINIUS:
O blessed heavens!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
VOLUMNIA:
More noble blows than ever thou wise wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rds;
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet[SEQ_SPLITTER] go:
Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
His good[SEQ_SPLITTER] sword in his hand.

SICINIUS:
What then?

VIRGILI[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
What then!
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
VOLUMNIA:
Bastards and all.
Good man, the wounds [SEQ_SPLITTER]that he does bear for Rome!

MENENIUS:
Come, come,[SEQ_SPLITTER] peace.

SICINIUS:
I would he had continued to his[SEQ_SPLITTER] country
As he began, and not unknit himself
The n[SEQ_SPLITTER]oble knot he made.

BRUTUS:
I would he had.

VOLUM[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIA:
'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabb[SEQ_SPLITTER]le:
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
As [SEQ_SPLITTER]I can of those mysteries which heaven
Will not hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e earth to know.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us go.

VOLUMN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IA:
Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
You have done a [SEQ_SPLITTER]brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
As far as dot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h the Capitol exceed
The meanest house in Rome, so[SEQ_SPLITTER] far my son--
This lady's husband here, this, do y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou see--
Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll.

BRUTUS:
Well, well, we'll leave you.

SICINIU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Why stay we to be baited
With one that wants he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r wits?

VOLUMNIA:
Take my prayers with you.
I wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld the gods had nothing else to do
But to confirm [SEQ_SPLITTER]my curses! Could I meet 'em
But once a-day, it wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld unclog my heart
Of what lies heavy to't.

MENEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
You have told them home;
And, by my troth, yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u have cause. You'll sup with me?

VOLUMNIA:
Anger[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s my meat; I sup upon myself,
And so shall starve[SEQ_SPLITTER] with feeding. Come, let's go:
Leave this faint pu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ling and lament as I do,
In anger, Juno-like. Come[SEQ_SPLITTER], come, come.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!

Roman:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]know you well, sir, and you know
me: your name, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]think, is Adrian.

Volsce:
It is so, sir: truly, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have forgot you.

Roman:
I am a Roman; and my ser[SEQ_SPLITTER]vices are,
as you are, against 'em: know you me ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]t?

Volsce:
Nicanor? no.

Roman:
The same, sir.

V[SEQ_SPLITTER]olsce:
You had more beard when I last saw you; but[SEQ_SPLITTER] your
favour is well approved by your tongue. What[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s the
news in Rome? I have a note from the Volsci[SEQ_SPLITTER]an state,
to find you out there: you have well sav[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed me a
day's journey.

Roman:
There hath been in [SEQ_SPLITTER]Rome strange insurrections; the
people against the[SEQ_SPLITTER] senators, patricians, and nobles.

Volsce:
Hath b[SEQ_SPLITTER]een! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
so: t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hey are in a most warlike preparation, and
hope to[SEQ_SPLITTER] come upon them in the heat of their division.

Ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]man:
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng
would make it flame again: for the nobles recei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve
so to heart the banishment of that worthy
Corio[SEQ_SPLITTER]lanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all[SEQ_SPLITTER] power from the people and to pluck from them
thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
tell[SEQ_SPLITTER] you, and is almost mature for the violent
breakin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g out.

Volsce:
Coriolanus banished!

Roman:
Banis[SEQ_SPLITTER]hed, sir.

Volsce:
You will be welcome with this i[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntelligence, Nicanor.

Roman:
The day serves well [SEQ_SPLITTER]for them now. I have heard it
said, the fittest ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]me to corrupt a man's wife is
when she's fallen ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t with her husband. Your noble
Tullus Aufidius wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l appear well in these wars, his
great opposer, Co[SEQ_SPLITTER]riolanus, being now in no request
of his country.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Volsce:
He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]us
accidentally to encounter you: you have ended m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
business, and I will merrily accompany you home.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Roman:
I shall, between this and supper, tell yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u most
strange things from Rome; all tending to th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e good of
their adversaries. Have you an army read[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, say you?

Volsce:
A most royal one; the centuri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ons and their charges,
distinctly billeted, alread[SEQ_SPLITTER]y in the entertainment,
and to be on foot at an ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur's warning.

Roman:
I am joyful to hear of their[SEQ_SPLITTER] readiness, and am the
man, I think, that shall se[SEQ_SPLITTER]t them in present action.
So, sir, heartily well m[SEQ_SPLITTER]et, and most glad of your company.

Volsce:
You ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
to [SEQ_SPLITTER]be glad of yours.

Roman:
Well, let us go together[SEQ_SPLITTER].

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly city is this Antium. City,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
Of thes[SEQ_SPLITTER]e fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard groan a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd drop: then know me not,
Lest that thy wives wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h spits and boys with stones
In puny battle slay m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.
Save you, sir.

Citizen:
And you.

CORIOLANUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Direct me, if it be your will,
Where great Aufidiu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen:
He is, and feas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts the nobles of the state
At his house this night[SEQ_SPLITTER].

CORIOLANUS:
Which is his house, beseech you?

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]itizen:
This, here before you.

CORIOLANUS:
Thank [SEQ_SPLITTER]you, sir: farewell.
O world, thy slippery turns! F[SEQ_SPLITTER]riends now fast sworn,
Whose double bosoms seem to[SEQ_SPLITTER] wear one heart,
Whose house, whose bed, whose mea[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, and exercise,
Are still together, who twin, as [SEQ_SPLITTER]'twere, in love
Unseparable, shall within this hou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r,
On a dissension of a doit, break out
To bittere[SEQ_SPLITTER]st enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose passions and wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ose plots have broke their sleep,
To take the one [SEQ_SPLITTER]the other, by some chance,
Some trick not worth an[SEQ_SPLITTER] egg, shall grow dear friends
And interjoin their [SEQ_SPLITTER]issues. So with me:
My birth-place hate I, and my [SEQ_SPLITTER]love's upon
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he sla[SEQ_SPLITTER]y me,
He does fair justice; if he give me way,
I'l[SEQ_SPLITTER]l do his country service.

First Servingman:
Wine,[SEQ_SPLITTER] wine, wine! What service
is here! I think our fel[SEQ_SPLITTER]lows are asleep.

Second Servingman:
Where's Cotus[SEQ_SPLITTER]? my master calls
for him. Cotus!

CORIOLANUS:
A g[SEQ_SPLITTER]oodly house: the feast smells well; but I
Appear n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot like a guest.

First Servingman:
What would you[SEQ_SPLITTER] have, friend? whence are you?
Here's no place for[SEQ_SPLITTER] you: pray, go to the door.

CORIOLANUS:
I have de[SEQ_SPLITTER]served no better entertainment,
In being Coriolanu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.

Second Servingman:
Whence are you, sir? Has th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e porter his eyes in his
head; that he gives entra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce to such companions?
Pray, get you out.

CORIOL[SEQ_SPLITTER]ANUS:
Away!

Second Servingman:
Away! get you away[SEQ_SPLITTER].

CORIOLANUS:
Now thou'rt troublesome.

Second Se[SEQ_SPLITTER]rvingman:
Are you so brave? I'll have you talked w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith anon.

Third Servingman:
What fellow's this?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]First Servingman:
A strange one as ever I looked o[SEQ_SPLITTER]n: I cannot get him
out of the house: prithee, cal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l my master to him.

Third Servingman:
What have y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
the house.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
CORIOLANUS:
Let me but stand; I will not hurt you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r hearth.

Third Servingman:
What are you?

CORIOL[SEQ_SPLITTER]ANUS:
A gentleman.

Third Servingman:
A marvellous[SEQ_SPLITTER] poor one.

CORIOLANUS:
True, so I am.

Third Serv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ingman:
Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some oth[SEQ_SPLITTER]er
station; here's no place for you; pray you, avo[SEQ_SPLITTER]id: come.

CORIOLANUS:
Follow your function, go, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd batten on cold bits.

Third Servingman:
What, y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
strang[SEQ_SPLITTER]e guest he has here.

Second Servingman:
And I sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll.

Third Servingman:
Where dwellest thou?

CORIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LANUS:
Under the canopy.

Third Servingman:
Under [SEQ_SPLITTER]the canopy!

CORIOLANUS:
Ay.

Third Servingman:
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere's that?

CORIOLANUS:
I' the city of kites and [SEQ_SPLITTER]crows.

Third Servingman:
I' the city of kites and[SEQ_SPLITTER] crows! What an ass it is!
Then thou dwellest with[SEQ_SPLITTER] daws too?

CORIOLANUS:
No, I serve not thy master[SEQ_SPLITTER].

Third Servingman:
How, sir! do you meddle with [SEQ_SPLITTER]my master?

CORIOLANUS:
Ay; 'tis an honester servi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce than to meddle with thy
mistress. Thou pratest,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and pratest; serve with thy
trencher, hence!

AUF[SEQ_SPLITTER]IDIUS:
Where is this fellow?

Second Servingman:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for[SEQ_SPLITTER]
disturbing the lords within.

AUFIDIUS:
Whence co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Why speak'[SEQ_SPLITTER]st not? speak, man: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]If, Tullus,
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ommands me name myself.

AUFIDIUS:
What is thy nam[SEQ_SPLITTER]e?

CORIOLANUS:
A name unmusical to the Volscians'[SEQ_SPLITTER] ears,
And harsh in sound to thine.

AUFIDIUS:
Say[SEQ_SPLITTER], what's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d thy face
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s torn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ame?

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'[SEQ_SPLITTER]st
thou me yet?

AUFIDIUS:
I know thee not: thy na[SEQ_SPLITTER]me?

CORIOLANUS:
My name is Caius Marcius, who hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My s[SEQ_SPLITTER]urname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
The extre[SEQ_SPLITTER]me dangers and the drops of blood
Shed for my than[SEQ_SPLITTER]kless country are requited
But with that surname; [SEQ_SPLITTER]a good memory,
And witness of the malice and displ[SEQ_SPLITTER]easure
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name[SEQ_SPLITTER] remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Perm[SEQ_SPLITTER]itted by our dastard nobles, who
Have all forsook [SEQ_SPLITTER]me, hath devour'd the rest;
And suffer'd me by the[SEQ_SPLITTER] voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of hope--
Mistake me not--to save my life, for i[SEQ_SPLITTER]f
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
To b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee, that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs[SEQ_SPLITTER] and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy co[SEQ_SPLITTER]untry, speed
thee straight,
And make my misery ser[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve thy turn: so use it
That my revengeful services[SEQ_SPLITTER] may prove
As benefits to thee, for I will fight
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]gainst my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all [SEQ_SPLITTER]the under fiends. But if so be
Thou darest not thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s and that to prove more fortunes
Thou'rt tired, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most wear[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancien[SEQ_SPLITTER]t malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]awn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee service.

AUFIDIUS:
O Marcius, Marcius!
Each [SEQ_SPLITTER]word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A r[SEQ_SPLITTER]oot of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond c[SEQ_SPLITTER]loud speak divine things,
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld[SEQ_SPLITTER] not believe them more
Than thee, all noble Marciu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where a[SEQ_SPLITTER]gainst
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he anvil of my sword, and do contest
As hotly and [SEQ_SPLITTER]as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious streng[SEQ_SPLITTER]th I did
Contend against thy valour. Know thou fir[SEQ_SPLITTER]st,
I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ruer breath; but that I see thee here,
Thou noble [SEQ_SPLITTER]thing! more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first[SEQ_SPLITTER] my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why[SEQ_SPLITTER], thou Mars! I tell thee,
We have a power on foot;[SEQ_SPLITTER] and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat[SEQ_SPLITTER] me out
Twelve several times, and I have nightly s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ince
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]e have been down together in my sleep,
Unbuckling [SEQ_SPLITTER]helms, fisting each other's throat,
And waked half[SEQ_SPLITTER] dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quar[SEQ_SPLITTER]rel else to Rome, but that
Thou art thence banish'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ike a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
And ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke our friendly senators by the hands;
Who now are[SEQ_SPLITTER] here, taking their leaves of me,
Who am prepared [SEQ_SPLITTER]against your territories,
Though not for Rome itse[SEQ_SPLITTER]lf.

CORIOLANUS:
You bless me, gods!

AUFIDIUS:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]erefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]leading of thine own revenges, take
The one half o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f my commission; and set down--
As best thou art e[SEQ_SPLITTER]xperienced, since thou know'st
Thy country's stren[SEQ_SPLITTER]gth and weakness,--thine own ways;
Whether to knoc[SEQ_SPLITTER]k against the gates of Rome,
Or rudely visit them [SEQ_SPLITTER]in parts remote,
To fright them, ere destroy. But [SEQ_SPLITTER]come in:
Let me commend thee first to those that s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius[SEQ_SPLITTER], that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

First S[SEQ_SPLITTER]ervingman:
Here's a strange alteration!

Second Se[SEQ_SPLITTER]rvingman:
By my hand, I had thought to have struck[SEQ_SPLITTER]en him with
a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his [SEQ_SPLITTER]clothes made a
false report of him.

First Serving[SEQ_SPLITTER]man:
What an arm he has! he turned me about with h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top[SEQ_SPLITTER].

Second Servingman:
Nay, I knew by his face that[SEQ_SPLITTER] there was something in
him: he had, sir, a kind o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f face, methought,--I
cannot tell how to term it.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
First Servingman:
He had so; looking as it were--[SEQ_SPLITTER]would I were hanged,
but I thought there was more [SEQ_SPLITTER]in him than I could think.

Second Servingman:
So [SEQ_SPLITTER]did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
man [SEQ_SPLITTER]i' the world.

First Servingman:
I think he is: bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t a greater soldier than he you wot on.

Second Se[SEQ_SPLITTER]rvingman:
Who, my master?

First Servingman:
Nay, [SEQ_SPLITTER]it's no matter for that.

Second Servingman:
Worth[SEQ_SPLITTER] six on him.

First Servingman:
Nay, not so neithe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r: but I take him to be the
greater soldier.

Seco[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd Servingman:
Faith, look you, one cannot tell ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w to say that:
for the defence of a town, our gene[SEQ_SPLITTER]ral is excellent.

First Servingman:
Ay, and for a[SEQ_SPLITTER]n assault too.

Third Servingman:
O slaves, I can [SEQ_SPLITTER]tell you news,-- news, you rascals!

First Serving[SEQ_SPLITTER]man:
What, what, what? let's partake.

Third Servi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngman:
I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad as
lieve be a condemned man.

First Servingman:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Wherefore? wherefore?

Third Servingman:
Why, her[SEQ_SPLITTER]e's he that was wont to thwack our general,
Caius [SEQ_SPLITTER]Marcius.

First Servingman:
Why do you say 'thwack[SEQ_SPLITTER] our general '?

Third Servingman:
I do not say 't[SEQ_SPLITTER]hwack our general;' but he was always
good enough [SEQ_SPLITTER]for him.

Second Servingman:
Come, we are fellows [SEQ_SPLITTER]and friends: he was ever too
hard for him; I have [SEQ_SPLITTER]heard him say so himself.

First Servingman:
He wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s too hard for him directly, to say the troth
on't[SEQ_SPLITTER]: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
him l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ike a carbon ado.

Second Servingman:
An he had be[SEQ_SPLITTER]en cannibally given, he might have
broiled and eat[SEQ_SPLITTER]en him too.

First Servingman:
But, more of thy ne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ws?

Third Servingman:
Why, he is so made on here [SEQ_SPLITTER]within, as if he were son
and heir to Mars; set at[SEQ_SPLITTER] upper end o' the table; no
question asked him by [SEQ_SPLITTER]any of the senators, but they
stand bald before hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m: our general himself makes a
mistress of him: sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]nctifies himself with's hand and
turns up the whit[SEQ_SPLITTER]e o' the eye to his discourse. But
the bottom of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he news is that our general is cut i'
the middle a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd but one half of what he was
yesterday; for the [SEQ_SPLITTER]other has half, by the entreaty
and grant of the w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the porter[SEQ_SPLITTER] of Rome gates by the ears: he
will mow all down b[SEQ_SPLITTER]efore him, and leave his passage polled.

Second S[SEQ_SPLITTER]ervingman:
And he's as like to do't as any man I c[SEQ_SPLITTER]an imagine.

Third Servingman:
Do't! he will do't;[SEQ_SPLITTER] for, look you, sir, he has as
many friends as ene[SEQ_SPLITTER]mies; which friends, sir, as it
were, durst not, l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ook you, sir, show themselves, as
we term it, his [SEQ_SPLITTER]friends whilst he's in directitude.

First Serving[SEQ_SPLITTER]man:
Directitude! what's that?

Third Servingman:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]and the man in blood, they will out of their
burro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ws, like conies after rain, and revel all with
him[SEQ_SPLITTER].

First Servingman:
But when goes this forward?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Third Servingman:
To-morrow; to-day; presently; yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u shall have the
drum struck up this afternoon: 't[SEQ_SPLITTER]is, as it were, a
parcel of their feast, and to be[SEQ_SPLITTER] executed ere they
wipe their lips.

Second Servin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gman:
Why, then we shall have a stirring world aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]in.
This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, incre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ase
tailors, and breed ballad-makers.

First Servi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngman:
Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as[SEQ_SPLITTER] far as
day does night; it's spritely, waking, aud[SEQ_SPLITTER]ible, and
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, [SEQ_SPLITTER]lethargy;
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a gett[SEQ_SPLITTER]er of more
bastard children than war's a destroyer[SEQ_SPLITTER] of men.

Second Servingman:
'Tis so: and as war, [SEQ_SPLITTER]in some sort, may be said to
be a ravisher, so it [SEQ_SPLITTER]cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuc[SEQ_SPLITTER]kolds.

First Servingman:
Ay, and it makes men hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]e one another.

Third Servingman:
Reason; because [SEQ_SPLITTER]they then less need one another.
The wars for my m[SEQ_SPLITTER]oney. I hope to see Romans as cheap
as Volscians. [SEQ_SPLITTER]They are rising, they are rising.

All:
In, in, in[SEQ_SPLITTER], in!

SICINIUS:
We hear not of him, neither need [SEQ_SPLITTER]we fear him;
His remedies are tame i' the present [SEQ_SPLITTER]peace
And quietness of the people, which before
We[SEQ_SPLITTER]re in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
Blus[SEQ_SPLITTER]h that the world goes well, who rather had,
Though[SEQ_SPLITTER] they themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentio[SEQ_SPLITTER]us numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesme[SEQ_SPLITTER]n with in their shops and going
About their functi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ons friendly.

BRUTUS:
We stood to't in good time.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Is this Menenius?

SICINIUS:
'Tis he,'tis he: O, [SEQ_SPLITTER]he is grown most kind of late.

Both Tribunes:
Hai[SEQ_SPLITTER]l sir!

MENENIUS:
Hail to you both!

SICINIUS:
You[SEQ_SPLITTER]r Coriolanus
Is not much miss'd, but with his frie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds:
The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Were he more angry at it.

MENENIUS:
All's well; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and might have been much better, if
He could have [SEQ_SPLITTER]temporized.

SICINIUS:
Where is he, hear you?

MEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENIUS:
Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wif[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Hear nothing from him.

Citizens:
The gods prese[SEQ_SPLITTER]rve you both!

SICINIUS:
God-den, our neighbours.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BRUTUS:
God-den to you all, god-den to you all.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]First Citizen:
Ourselves, our wives, and children,[SEQ_SPLITTER] on our knees,
Are bound to pray for you both.

SI[SEQ_SPLITTER]CINIUS:
Live, and thrive!

BRUTUS:
Farewell, kind [SEQ_SPLITTER]neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Had loved you as [SEQ_SPLITTER]we did.

Citizens:
Now the gods keep you!

Both Tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ibunes:
Farewell, farewell.

SICINIUS:
This is a h[SEQ_SPLITTER]appier and more comely time
Than when these fellow[SEQ_SPLITTER]s ran about the streets,
Crying confusion.

BRUTUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war; b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut insolent,
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll thinking,
Self-loving,--

SICINIUS:
And affecti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng one sole throne,
Without assistance.

MENENIUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I think not so.

SICINIUS:
We should by this, to [SEQ_SPLITTER]all our lamentation,
If he had gone forth consul, [SEQ_SPLITTER]found it so.

BRUTUS:
The gods have well prevented[SEQ_SPLITTER] it, and Rome
Sits safe and still without him.

AE[SEQ_SPLITTER]dile:
Worthy tribunes,
There is a slave, whom we h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave put in prison,
Reports, the Volsces with two s[SEQ_SPLITTER]everal powers
Are enter'd in the Roman territories[SEQ_SPLITTER],
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat lies before 'em.

MENENIUS:
'Tis Aufidius,
Who[SEQ_SPLITTER], hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Thrusts fort[SEQ_SPLITTER]h his horns again into the world;
Which were inshe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
And durst not on[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce peep out.

SICINIUS:
Come, what talk you
Of Mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]cius?

BRUTUS:
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]nnot be
The Volsces dare break with us.

MENENIUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And three examples of the like have been
Within my[SEQ_SPLITTER] age. But reason with the fellow,
Before you punis[SEQ_SPLITTER]h him, where he heard this,
Lest you shall chance [SEQ_SPLITTER]to whip your information
And beat the messenger wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]o bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded.

SICINIUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Tell not me:
I know this cannot be.

BRUTUS:
Not [SEQ_SPLITTER]possible.

Messenger:
The nobles in great earnestn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess are going
All to the senate-house: some news i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s come
That turns their countenances.

SICINIUS:
'[SEQ_SPLITTER]Tis this slave;--
Go whip him, 'fore the people's [SEQ_SPLITTER]eyes:--his raising;
Nothing but his report.

Messe[SEQ_SPLITTER]nger:
Yes, worthy sir,
The slave's report is secon[SEQ_SPLITTER]ded; and more,
More fearful, is deliver'd.

SICINI[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
What more fearful?

Messenger:
It is spoke fre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ely out of many mouths--
How probable I do not kno[SEQ_SPLITTER]w--that Marcius,
Join'd with Aufidius, leads a pow[SEQ_SPLITTER]er 'gainst Rome,
And vows revenge as spacious as b[SEQ_SPLITTER]etween
The young'st and oldest thing.

SICINIUS:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]his is most likely!

BRUTUS:
Raised only, that the[SEQ_SPLITTER] weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again.

SI[SEQ_SPLITTER]CINIUS:
The very trick on't.

MENENIUS:
This is un[SEQ_SPLITTER]likely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than vio[SEQ_SPLITTER]lentest contrariety.

Second Messenger:
You are se[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt for to the senate:
A fearful army, led by Caius[SEQ_SPLITTER] Marcius
Associated with Aufidius, rages
Upon our [SEQ_SPLITTER]territories; and have already
O'erborne their way,[SEQ_SPLITTER] consumed with fire, and took
What lay before them[SEQ_SPLITTER].

COMINIUS:
O, you have made good work!

MENENIUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
What news? what news?

COMINIUS:
You have holp t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o ravish your own daughters and
To melt the city l[SEQ_SPLITTER]eads upon your pates,
To see your wives dishonour'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d to your noses,--

MENENIUS:
What's the news? wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t's the news?

COMINIUS:
Your temples burned in th[SEQ_SPLITTER]eir cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood[SEQ_SPLITTER], confined
Into an auger's bore.

MENENIUS:
Pray n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow, your news?
You have made fair work, I fear me.[SEQ_SPLITTER]--Pray, your news?--
If Marcius should be join'd w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith Volscians,--

COMINIUS:
If!
He is their god: h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e leads them like a thing
Made by some other deity[SEQ_SPLITTER] than nature,
That shapes man better; and they fol[SEQ_SPLITTER]low him,
Against us brats, with no less confidence[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Or butcher[SEQ_SPLITTER]s killing flies.

MENENIUS:
You have made good wor[SEQ_SPLITTER]k,
You and your apron-men; you that stood so up mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch
on the voice of occupation and
The breath of ga[SEQ_SPLITTER]rlic-eaters!

COMINIUS:
He will shake
Your Rome ab[SEQ_SPLITTER]out your ears.

MENENIUS:
As Hercules
Did shake do[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn mellow fruit.
You have made fair work!

BRUTUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
But is this true, sir?

COMINIUS:
Ay; and you'll [SEQ_SPLITTER]look pale
Before you find it other. All the region[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Are mock'd f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or valiant ignorance,
And perish constant fools. W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ho is't can blame him?
Your enemies and his find s[SEQ_SPLITTER]omething in him.

MENENIUS:
We are all undone, unl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess
The noble man have mercy.

COMINIUS:
Who shall[SEQ_SPLITTER] ask it?
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the p[SEQ_SPLITTER]eople
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of[SEQ_SPLITTER] the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
Shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
As[SEQ_SPLITTER] those should do that had deserved his hate,
And t[SEQ_SPLITTER]herein show'd like enemies.

MENENIUS:
'Tis true:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]If he were putting to my house the brand
That shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld consume it, I have not the face
To say 'Beseech[SEQ_SPLITTER] you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
You and yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur crafts! you have crafted fair!

COMINIUS:
You h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave brought
A trembling upon Rome, such as was nev[SEQ_SPLITTER]er
So incapable of help.

Both Tribunes:
Say not w[SEQ_SPLITTER]e brought it.

MENENIUS:
How! Was it we? we loved [SEQ_SPLITTER]him but, like beasts
And cowardly nobles, gave way[SEQ_SPLITTER] unto your clusters,
Who did hoot him out o' the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ity.

COMINIUS:
But I fear
They'll roar him in aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]in. Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys[SEQ_SPLITTER] his points
As if he were his officer: desperation[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Is all the policy, strength and defence,
That Rom[SEQ_SPLITTER]e can make against them.

MENENIUS:
Here come the [SEQ_SPLITTER]clusters.
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat made the air unwholesome, when you cast
Your s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' exil[SEQ_SPLITTER]e. Now he's coming;
And not a hair upon a soldier'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s head
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcom[SEQ_SPLITTER]bs
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
And p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
if he coul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d burn us all into one coal,
We have deserved it.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Citizens:
Faith, we hear fearful news.

First Cit[SEQ_SPLITTER]izen:
For mine own part,
When I said, banish him, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I said 'twas pity.

Second Citizen:
And so did I.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Third Citizen:
And so did I; and, to say the trut[SEQ_SPLITTER]h, so did very
many of us: that we did, we did for[SEQ_SPLITTER] the best; and
though we willingly consented to hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s banishment, yet
it was against our will.

COMINI[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
Ye re goodly things, you voices!

MENENIUS:
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u have made
Good work, you and your cry! Shall's t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o the Capitol?

COMINIUS:
O, ay, what else?

SICIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hese are a side that would be glad to have
This tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue which they so seem to fear. Go home,
And show n[SEQ_SPLITTER]o sign of fear.

First Citizen:
The gods be good t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o us! Come, masters, let's home.
I ever said we we[SEQ_SPLITTER]re i' the wrong when we banished
him.

Second Citi[SEQ_SPLITTER]zen:
So did we all. But, come, let's home.

BRUTUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I do not like this news.

SICINIUS:
Nor I.

BRUT[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld buy this for a lie!

SICINIUS:
Pray, let us go.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

AUFIDIUS:
Do they still fly to the Roman?

Lieut[SEQ_SPLITTER]enant:
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]eir talk at table, and their thanks at end;
And yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u are darken'd in this action, sir,
Even by your o[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn.

AUFIDIUS:
I cannot help it now,
Unless, by us[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing means, I lame the foot
Of our design. He bears[SEQ_SPLITTER] himself more proudlier,
Even to my person, than I[SEQ_SPLITTER] thought he would
When first I did embrace him: ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]t his nature
In that's no changeling; and I must e[SEQ_SPLITTER]xcuse
What cannot be amended.

Lieutenant:
Yet I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ish, sir,--
I mean for your particular,--you had n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot
Join'd in commission with him; but either
Had b[SEQ_SPLITTER]orne the action of yourself, or else
To him had le[SEQ_SPLITTER]ft it solely.

AUFIDIUS:
I understand thee well; a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd be thou sure,
when he shall come to his account[SEQ_SPLITTER], he knows not
What I can urge against him. Althou[SEQ_SPLITTER]gh it seems,
And so he thinks, and is no less appa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rent
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things f[SEQ_SPLITTER]airly.
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tate,
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon[SEQ_SPLITTER]
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
That w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hich shall break his neck or hazard mine,
Whene'er[SEQ_SPLITTER] we come to our account.

Lieutenant:
Sir, I besee[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch you, think you he'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS:
All[SEQ_SPLITTER] places yield to him ere he sits down;
And the nob[SEQ_SPLITTER]ility of Rome are his:
The senators and patricians[SEQ_SPLITTER] love him too:
The tribunes are no soldiers; and t[SEQ_SPLITTER]heir people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hast[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
As[SEQ_SPLITTER] is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
By sovere[SEQ_SPLITTER]ignty of nature. First he was
A noble servant to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hem; but he could not
Carry his honours even: whet[SEQ_SPLITTER]her 'twas pride,
Which out of daily fortune ever t[SEQ_SPLITTER]aints
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o fail in the disposing of those chances
Which he [SEQ_SPLITTER]was lord of; or whether nature,
Not to be other th[SEQ_SPLITTER]an one thing, not moving
From the casque to the cu[SEQ_SPLITTER]shion, but commanding peace
Even with the same aus[SEQ_SPLITTER]terity and garb
As he controll'd the war; but one [SEQ_SPLITTER]of these--
As he hath spices of them all, not all,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
So h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
To chok[SEQ_SPLITTER]e it in the utterance. So our virtues
Lie in the i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nterpretation of the time:
And power, unto itself [SEQ_SPLITTER]most commendable,
Hath not a tomb so evident as a [SEQ_SPLITTER]chair
To extol what it hath done.
One fire drives [SEQ_SPLITTER]out one fire; one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights[SEQ_SPLITTER] falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
Come, let[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
Thou art poor[SEQ_SPLITTER]'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

MENENIUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
Which[SEQ_SPLITTER] was sometime his general; who loved him
In a most[SEQ_SPLITTER] dear particular. He call'd me father:
But what o'[SEQ_SPLITTER] that? Go, you that banish'd him;
A mile before hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s tent fall down, and knee
The way into his mercy:[SEQ_SPLITTER] nay, if he coy'd
To hear Cominius speak, I'll kee[SEQ_SPLITTER]p at home.

COMINIUS:
He would not seem to know me[SEQ_SPLITTER].

MENENIUS:
Do you hear?

COMINIUS:
Yet one time [SEQ_SPLITTER]he did call me by my name:
I urged our old acquain[SEQ_SPLITTER]tance, and the drops
That we have bled together. C[SEQ_SPLITTER]oriolanus
He would not answer to: forbad all names[SEQ_SPLITTER];
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
Till he had[SEQ_SPLITTER] forged himself a name o' the fire
Of burning Rome[SEQ_SPLITTER].

MENENIUS:
Why, so: you have made good work!
A p[SEQ_SPLITTER]air of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
To make[SEQ_SPLITTER] coals cheap,--a noble memory!

COMINIUS:
I minded[SEQ_SPLITTER] him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it was less ex[SEQ_SPLITTER]pected: he replied,
It was a bare petition of a st[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate
To one whom they had punish'd.

MENENIUS:
Very[SEQ_SPLITTER] well:
Could he say less?

COMINIUS:
I offer'd to [SEQ_SPLITTER]awaken his regard
For's private friends: his answe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r to me was,
He could not stay to pick them in a p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ile
Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
And st[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill to nose the offence.

MENENIUS:
For one poor g[SEQ_SPLITTER]rain or two!
I am one of those; his mother, wife, [SEQ_SPLITTER]his child,
And this brave fellow too, we are the g[SEQ_SPLITTER]rains:
You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.

SICINIU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]n this so never-needed help, yet do not
Upbraid's [SEQ_SPLITTER]with our distress. But, sure, if you
Would be your[SEQ_SPLITTER] country's pleader, your good tongue,
More than th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e instant army we can make,
Might stop our country[SEQ_SPLITTER]man.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not meddle.

SICINIUS:
Pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay you, go to him.

MENENIUS:
What should I do?

B[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUTUS:
Only make trial what your love can do
For R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome, towards Marcius.

MENENIUS:
Well, and say tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Marcius
Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
Unhe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard; what then?
But as a discontented friend, grie[SEQ_SPLITTER]f-shot
With his unkindness? say't be so?

SICINIUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Yet your good will
must have that thanks from Ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]me, after the measure
As you intended well.

MENEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
I'll undertake 't:
I think he'll hear me. Yet[SEQ_SPLITTER], to bite his lip
And hum at good Cominius, much u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nhearts me.
He was not taken well; he had not dine[SEQ_SPLITTER]d:
The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then[SEQ_SPLITTER]
We pout upon the morning, are unapt
To give or to[SEQ_SPLITTER] forgive; but when we have stuff'd
These and these[SEQ_SPLITTER] conveyances of our blood
With wine and feeding, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]e have suppler souls
Than in our priest-like fasts[SEQ_SPLITTER]: therefore I'll watch him
Till he be dieted to my[SEQ_SPLITTER] request,
And then I'll set upon him.

BRUTUS:
You[SEQ_SPLITTER] know the very road into his kindness,
And cannot [SEQ_SPLITTER]lose your way.

MENENIUS:
Good faith, I'll prove h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im,
Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowl[SEQ_SPLITTER]edge
Of my success.

COMINIUS:
He'll never hear hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m.

SICINIUS:
Not?

COMINIUS:
I tell you, he does [SEQ_SPLITTER]sit in gold, his eye
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and[SEQ_SPLITTER] his injury
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd befo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re him;
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d me
Thus, with his speechless hand: what he woul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d do,
He sent in writing after me; what he would n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot,
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
So that all hope is vain.
Unless his noble mother[SEQ_SPLITTER], and his wife;
Who, as I hear, mean to solicit hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m
For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence[SEQ_SPLITTER],
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.

Fir[SEQ_SPLITTER]st Senator:
Stay: whence are you?

Second Senator:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Stand, and go back.

MENENIUS:
You guard like men[SEQ_SPLITTER]; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
I am an officer o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f state, and come
To speak with Coriolanus.

First[SEQ_SPLITTER] Senator:
From whence?

MENENIUS:
From Rome.

Firs[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Senator:
You may not pass, you must return: our [SEQ_SPLITTER]general
Will no more hear from thence.

Second Sen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ator:
You'll see your Rome embraced with fire befo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re
You'll speak with Coriolanus.

MENENIUS:
Good m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y friends,
If you have heard your general talk of [SEQ_SPLITTER]Rome,
And of his friends there, it is lots to blan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ks,
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

First Senator:
Be it so; go back: the virtue of [SEQ_SPLITTER]your name
Is not here passable.

MENENIUS:
I tell [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee, fellow,
The general is my lover: I have been[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The book of his good acts, whence men have read
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]is name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
For I have [SEQ_SPLITTER]ever verified my friends,
Of whom he's chief, with[SEQ_SPLITTER] all the size that verity
Would without lapsing su[SEQ_SPLITTER]ffer: nay, sometimes,
Like to a bowl upon a subtle[SEQ_SPLITTER] ground,
I have tumbled past the throw; and in his[SEQ_SPLITTER] praise
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore[SEQ_SPLITTER], fellow,
I must have leave to pass.

First Senato[SEQ_SPLITTER]r:
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his[SEQ_SPLITTER]
behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you[SEQ_SPLITTER]
should not pass here; no, though it were as virtu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous
to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back[SEQ_SPLITTER].

MENENIUS:
Prithee, fellow, remember my name is [SEQ_SPLITTER]Menenius,
always factionary on the party of your g[SEQ_SPLITTER]eneral.

Second Senator:
Howsoever you have been h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is liar, as you say you
have, I am one that, telli[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng true under him, must
say, you cannot pass. Ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]efore, go back.

MENENIUS:
Has he dined, canst tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u tell? for I would not
speak with him till after [SEQ_SPLITTER]dinner.

First Senator:
You are a Roman, are you?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
MENENIUS:
I am, as thy general is.

First Senator[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]when you have pushed out your gates the very
defen[SEQ_SPLITTER]der of them, and, in a violent popular
ignorance, [SEQ_SPLITTER]given your enemy your shield, think to
front his r[SEQ_SPLITTER]evenges with the easy groans of old
women, the vir[SEQ_SPLITTER]ginal palms of your daughters, or with
the palsied[SEQ_SPLITTER] intercession of such a decayed dotant as
you seem[SEQ_SPLITTER] to be? Can you think to blow out the
intended fir[SEQ_SPLITTER]e your city is ready to flame in, with
such weak b[SEQ_SPLITTER]reath as this? No, you are deceived;
therefore, ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck to Rome, and prepare for your
execution: you ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e condemned, our general has sworn
you out of repr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ieve and pardon.

MENENIUS:
Sirrah, if thy captain[SEQ_SPLITTER] knew I were here, he would
use me with estimation[SEQ_SPLITTER].

Second Senator:
Come, my captain knows you not.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

MENENIUS:
I mean, thy general.

First Senator:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]y general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
the utmost of your having: back.

MENENIUS:
Nay,[SEQ_SPLITTER] but, fellow, fellow,--

CORIOLANUS:
What's the ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]tter?

MENENIUS:
Now, you companion, I'll say an e[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrand for you:
You shall know now that I am in est[SEQ_SPLITTER]imation; you shall
perceive that a Jack guardant c[SEQ_SPLITTER]annot office me from
my son Coriolanus: guess, but[SEQ_SPLITTER] by my entertainment
with him, if thou standest no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t i' the state of
hanging, or of some death more l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ong in
spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ehold now
presently, and swoon for what's to come [SEQ_SPLITTER]upon thee.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod a[SEQ_SPLITTER]bout thy
particular prosperity, and love thee no w[SEQ_SPLITTER]orse than
thy old father Menenius does! O my son, [SEQ_SPLITTER]my son!
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee,[SEQ_SPLITTER] here's
water to quench it. I was hardly moved to [SEQ_SPLITTER]come to
thee; but being assured none but myself co[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld move
thee, I have been blown out of your gates[SEQ_SPLITTER] with
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy
petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varl[SEQ_SPLITTER]et
here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
[SEQ_SPLITTER]access to thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

MENENIUS:
How![SEQ_SPLITTER] away!

CORIOLANUS:
Wife, mother, child, I know no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t. My affairs
Are servanted to others: though I ow[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
My revenge properly, my remission lies
In Volsci[SEQ_SPLITTER]an breasts. That we have been familiar,
Ingrate fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rgetfulness shall poison, rather
Than pity note ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w much. Therefore, be gone.
Mine ears against your[SEQ_SPLITTER] suits are stronger than
Your gates against my for[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce. Yet, for I loved thee,
Take this along; I writ[SEQ_SPLITTER] it for thy sake
And would have rent it. Another w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord, Menenius,
I will not hear thee speak. This ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, Aufidius,
Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou beho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld'st!

AUFIDIUS:
You keep a constant temper.

Fir[SEQ_SPLITTER]st Senator:
Now, sir, is your name Menenius?

Seco[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd Senator:
'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: [SEQ_SPLITTER]you know the
way home again.

First Senator:
Do yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness[SEQ_SPLITTER] back?

Second Senator:
What cause, do you think, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I have to swoon?

MENENIUS:
I neither care for the[SEQ_SPLITTER] world nor your general: for
such things as you, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] can scarce think there's any,
ye're so slight. He[SEQ_SPLITTER] that hath a will to die by
himself fears it not f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom another: let your general
do his worst. For yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u, be that you are, long; and
your misery increase[SEQ_SPLITTER] with your age! I say to you,
as I was said to, Aw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay!

First Senator:
A noble fellow, I warrant him.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Second Senator:
The worthy fellow is our general[SEQ_SPLITTER]: he's the rock, the
oak not to be wind-shaken.

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORIOLANUS:
We will before the walls of Rome tomorr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow
Set down our host. My partner in this action,
Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I have borne this business.

AUFIDIUS:
Only their [SEQ_SPLITTER]ends
You have respected; stopp'd your ears against[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The general suit of Rome; never admitted
A privat[SEQ_SPLITTER]e whisper, no, not with such friends
That thought [SEQ_SPLITTER]them sure of you.

CORIOLANUS:
This last old man,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
Lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed me above the measure of a father;
Nay, godded m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r whose old love I have,
Though I show'd sourly to[SEQ_SPLITTER] him, once more offer'd
The first conditions, whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h they did refuse
And cannot now accept; to grace [SEQ_SPLITTER]him only
That thought he could do more, a very lit[SEQ_SPLITTER]tle
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
Shall [SEQ_SPLITTER]I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time '[SEQ_SPLITTER]tis made? I will not.
My wife comes foremost; then[SEQ_SPLITTER] the honour'd mould
Wherein this trunk was framed,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and in her hand
The grandchild to her blood. But,[SEQ_SPLITTER] out, affection!
All bond and privilege of nature,[SEQ_SPLITTER] break!
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
What i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which [SEQ_SPLITTER]can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Of stro[SEQ_SPLITTER]nger earth than others. My mother bows;
As if Olym[SEQ_SPLITTER]pus to a molehill should
In supplication nod: and [SEQ_SPLITTER]my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession, which[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
Pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
Be such a g[SEQ_SPLITTER]osling to obey instinct, but stand,
As if a man we[SEQ_SPLITTER]re author of himself
And knew no other kin.

VIRGI[SEQ_SPLITTER]LIA:
My lord and husband!

CORIOLANUS:
These eyes [SEQ_SPLITTER]are not the same I wore in Rome.

VIRGILIA:
The so[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrow that delivers us thus changed
Makes you think[SEQ_SPLITTER] so.

CORIOLANUS:
Like a dull actor now,
I have fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rgot my part, and I am out,
Even to a full disgrac[SEQ_SPLITTER]e. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but do no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t say
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
Lon[SEQ_SPLITTER]g as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the je[SEQ_SPLITTER]alous queen of heaven, that kiss
I carried from th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee, dear; and my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er si[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce. You gods! I prate,
And the most noble mother [SEQ_SPLITTER]of the world
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e earth;
Of thy deep duty more impression show
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n that of common sons.

VOLUMNIA:
O, stand up bles[SEQ_SPLITTER]t!
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I kneel before thee; and unproperly
Show duty, as [SEQ_SPLITTER]mistaken all this while
Between the child and pare[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt.

CORIOLANUS:
What is this?
Your knees to me? t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o your corrected son?
Then let the pebbles on the [SEQ_SPLITTER]hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let the mutino[SEQ_SPLITTER]us winds
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery[SEQ_SPLITTER] sun;
Murdering impossibility, to make
What cannot[SEQ_SPLITTER] be, slight work.

VOLUMNIA:
Thou art my warrior;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?

CORI[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLANUS:
The noble sister of Publicola,
The moon of[SEQ_SPLITTER] Rome, chaste as the icicle
That's curdied by the [SEQ_SPLITTER]frost from purest snow
And hangs on Dian's temple:[SEQ_SPLITTER] dear Valeria!

VOLUMNIA:
This is a poor epitome o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f yours,
Which by the interpretation of full time
[SEQ_SPLITTER]May show like all yourself.

CORIOLANUS:
The god o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f soldiers,
With the consent of supreme Jove, info[SEQ_SPLITTER]rm
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ike a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
And sav[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing those that eye thee!

VOLUMNIA:
Your knee, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER]rah.

CORIOLANUS:
That's my brave boy!

VOLUMNIA:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
Are sui[SEQ_SPLITTER]tors to you.

CORIOLANUS:
I beseech you, peace:
Or[SEQ_SPLITTER], if you'ld ask, remember this before:
The thing I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by you d[SEQ_SPLITTER]enials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers, or capi[SEQ_SPLITTER]tulate
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]erein I seem unnatural: desire not
To ally my rage[SEQ_SPLITTER]s and revenges with
Your colder reasons.

VOLUMNIA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
O, no more, no more!
You have said you will not [SEQ_SPLITTER]grant us any thing;
For we have nothing else to as[SEQ_SPLITTER]k, but that
Which you deny already: yet we will as[SEQ_SPLITTER]k;
That, if you fail in our request, the blame
May[SEQ_SPLITTER] hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.

CORI[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLANUS:
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]VOLUMNIA:
Should we be silent and not speak, our r[SEQ_SPLITTER]aiment
And state of bodies would bewray what life
[SEQ_SPLITTER]We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
Ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w more unfortunate than all living women
Are we co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me hither: since that thy sight,
which should
Make[SEQ_SPLITTER] our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
with comfort[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and so[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrow;
Making the mother, wife and child to see
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] son, the husband and the father tearing
His count[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry's bowels out. And to poor we
Thine enmity's mos[SEQ_SPLITTER]t capital: thou barr'st us
Our prayers to the gods[SEQ_SPLITTER], which is a comfort
That all but we enjoy; for ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w can we,
Alas, how can we for our country pray.
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
The cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntry, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
Our comf[SEQ_SPLITTER]ort in the country. We must find
An evident calami[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty, though we had
Our wish, which side should win:[SEQ_SPLITTER] for either thou
Must, as a foreign recreant, be l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed
With manacles thorough our streets, or else
tri[SEQ_SPLITTER]umphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
And bear th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife and childr[SEQ_SPLITTER]en's blood. For myself, son,
I purpose not to wait[SEQ_SPLITTER] on fortune till
These wars determine: if I cannot[SEQ_SPLITTER] persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to bot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h parts
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no so[SEQ_SPLITTER]oner
March to assault thy country than to tread--
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]That brought thee to this world.

VIRGILIA:
Ay, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d mine,
That brought you forth this boy, to keep y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our name
Living to time.

Young MARCIUS:
A' shall [SEQ_SPLITTER]not tread on me;
I'll run away till I am bigger, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut then I'll fight.

CORIOLANUS:
Not of a woman's [SEQ_SPLITTER]tenderness to be,
Requires nor child nor woman's f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace to see.
I have sat too long.

VOLUMNIA:
Nay, g[SEQ_SPLITTER]o not from us thus.
If it were so that our request[SEQ_SPLITTER] did tend
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]s poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
Is that y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou reconcile them: while the Volsces
May say 'This[SEQ_SPLITTER] mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
'This we recei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ved;' and each in either side
Give the all-hail to[SEQ_SPLITTER] thee and cry 'Be blest
For making up this peace!'[SEQ_SPLITTER] Thou know'st, great son,
The end of war's uncerta[SEQ_SPLITTER]in, but this certain,
That, if thou conquer Rome, [SEQ_SPLITTER]the benefit
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such [SEQ_SPLITTER]a name,
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curse[SEQ_SPLITTER]s;
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
Destroy[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d his country, and his name remains
To the ensuin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
Thou hast affec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ted the fine strains of honour,
To imitate the gra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ces of the gods;
To tear with thunder the wide che[SEQ_SPLITTER]eks o' the air,
And yet to charge thy sulphur with[SEQ_SPLITTER] a bolt
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not [SEQ_SPLITTER]speak?
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
He[SEQ_SPLITTER] cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
Perh[SEQ_SPLITTER]aps thy childishness will move him more
Than can o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur reasons. There's no man in the world
More bound[SEQ_SPLITTER] to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
Like one [SEQ_SPLITTER]i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
Show'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy dear mother any courtesy,
When she, poor hen, [SEQ_SPLITTER]fond of no second brood,
Has cluck'd thee to the w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ars and safely home,
Loaden with honour. Say my re[SEQ_SPLITTER]quest's unjust,
And spurn me back: but if it be no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t so,
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plagu[SEQ_SPLITTER]e thee,
That thou restrain'st from me the duty whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
Down[SEQ_SPLITTER], ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
To his [SEQ_SPLITTER]surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to [SEQ_SPLITTER]our prayers. Down: an end;
This is the last: so we[SEQ_SPLITTER] will home to Rome,
And die among our neighbours. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Nay, behold 's:
This boy, that cannot tell what he[SEQ_SPLITTER] would have
But kneels and holds up bands for fell[SEQ_SPLITTER]owship,
Does reason our petition with more strengt[SEQ_SPLITTER]h
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
This[SEQ_SPLITTER] fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
His wife is [SEQ_SPLITTER]in Corioli and his child
Like him by chance. Yet g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive us our dispatch:
I am hush'd until our city be[SEQ_SPLITTER] a-fire,
And then I'll speak a little.

CORIOLANUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
O mother, mother!
What have you done? Behold, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e heavens do ope,
The gods look down, and this unn[SEQ_SPLITTER]atural scene
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O[SEQ_SPLITTER]!
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But, for y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our son,--believe it, O, believe it,
Most dangerou[SEQ_SPLITTER]sly you have with him prevail'd,
If not most morta[SEQ_SPLITTER]l to him. But, let it come.
Aufidius, though I can[SEQ_SPLITTER]not make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace. N[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow, good Aufidius,
Were you in my stead, would you[SEQ_SPLITTER] have heard
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidi[SEQ_SPLITTER]us?

AUFIDIUS:
I was moved withal.

CORIOLANUS:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]dare be sworn you were:
And, sir, it is no little [SEQ_SPLITTER]thing to make
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, [SEQ_SPLITTER]good sir,
What peace you'll make, advise me: for m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y part,
I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and [SEQ_SPLITTER]pray you,
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wif[SEQ_SPLITTER]e!

AUFIDIUS:

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, by and by;
But we w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill drink together; and you shall bear
A better wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]tness back than words, which we,
On like condition[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, will have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Ladies, you deserve
To have a temple built you: al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l the swords
In Italy, and her confederate arms,
C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould not have made this peace.

MENENIUS:
See you [SEQ_SPLITTER]yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
corner-stone?

SIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]INIUS:
Why, what of that?

MENENIUS:
If it be poss[SEQ_SPLITTER]ible for you to displace it with your
little finge[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, there is some hope the ladies of
Rome, especial[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly his mother, may prevail with him.
But I say the[SEQ_SPLITTER]re is no hope in't: our throats are
sentenced and [SEQ_SPLITTER]stay upon execution.

SICINIUS:
Is't possible that[SEQ_SPLITTER] so short a time can alter the
condition of a man![SEQ_SPLITTER]

MENENIUS:
There is differency between a grub and[SEQ_SPLITTER] a butterfly;
yet your butterfly was a grub. This [SEQ_SPLITTER]Marcius is grown
from man to dragon: he has wings;[SEQ_SPLITTER] he's more than a
creeping thing.

SICINIUS:
He lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ved his mother dearly.

MENENIUS:
So did he me: an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d he no more remembers his mother
now than an eigh[SEQ_SPLITTER]t-year-old horse. The tartness
of his face sours r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ipe grapes: when he walks, he
moves like an engine[SEQ_SPLITTER], and the ground shrinks before
his treading: he i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s able to pierce a corslet with
his eye; talks lik[SEQ_SPLITTER]e a knell, and his hum is a
battery. He sits in hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s state, as a thing made for
Alexander. What he bi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds be done is finished with
his bidding. He wants [SEQ_SPLITTER]nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to thro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne in.

SICINIUS:
Yes, mercy, if you report him tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]uly.

MENENIUS:
I paint him in the character. Mark[SEQ_SPLITTER] what mercy his
mother shall bring from him: there[SEQ_SPLITTER] is no more mercy
in him than there is milk in a m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ale tiger; that
shall our poor city find: and all [SEQ_SPLITTER]this is long of
you.

SICINIUS:
The gods be good u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nto us!

MENENIUS:
No, in such a case the gods wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l not be good unto
us. When we banished him, we re[SEQ_SPLITTER]spected not them;
and, he returning to break our n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ecks, they respect not us.

Messenger:
Sir, if you[SEQ_SPLITTER]'ld save your life, fly to your house:
The plebeia[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns have got your fellow-tribune
And hale him up an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d down, all swearing, if
The Roman ladies bring no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t comfort home,
They'll give him death by inches.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
SICINIUS:
What's the news?

Second Messenger:
Goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
A merri[SEQ_SPLITTER]er day did never yet greet Rome,
No, not the expul[SEQ_SPLITTER]sion of the Tarquins.

SICINIUS:
Friend,
Art thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]certain this is true? is it most certain?

Second [SEQ_SPLITTER]Messenger:
As certain as I know the sun is fire:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]here have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]e'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
As[SEQ_SPLITTER] the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you![SEQ_SPLITTER]
The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
Tab[SEQ_SPLITTER]ours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
Make the[SEQ_SPLITTER] sun dance. Hark you!

MENENIUS:
This is good news[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
Is wort[SEQ_SPLITTER]h of consuls, senators, patricians,
A city full; o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f tribunes, such as you,
A sea and land full. You [SEQ_SPLITTER]have pray'd well to-day:
This morning for ten thou[SEQ_SPLITTER]sand of your throats
I'd not have given a doit. Ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]rk, how they joy!

SICINIUS:
First, the gods bless[SEQ_SPLITTER] you for your tidings; next,
Accept my thankfulnes[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.

Second Messenger:
Sir, we have all
Great cause[SEQ_SPLITTER] to give great thanks.

SICINIUS:
They are near th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e city?

Second Messenger:
Almost at point to ente[SEQ_SPLITTER]r.

SICINIUS:
We will meet them,
And help the joy.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

First Senator:
Behold our patroness, the life of[SEQ_SPLITTER] Rome!
Call all your tribes together, praise the g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ods,
And make triumphant fires; strew flowers befo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re them:
Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
Cry 'We[SEQ_SPLITTER]lcome, ladies, welcome!'

All:
Welcome, ladies, We[SEQ_SPLITTER]lcome!

AUFIDIUS:
Go tell the lords o' the city I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am here:
Deliver them this paper: having read it,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
Even[SEQ_SPLITTER] in theirs and in the commons' ears,
Will vouch th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e truth of it. Him I accuse
The city ports by this[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath enter'd and
Intends to appear before the peo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ple, hoping
To purge herself with words: dispatch.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Most welcome!

First Conspirator:
How is it with [SEQ_SPLITTER]our general?

AUFIDIUS:
Even so
As with a man by h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is own alms empoison'd,
And with his charity slain[SEQ_SPLITTER].

Second Conspirator:
Most noble sir,
If you do h[SEQ_SPLITTER]old the same intent wherein
You wish'd us parties,[SEQ_SPLITTER] we'll deliver you
Of your great danger.

AUFIDIUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Sir, I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do fin[SEQ_SPLITTER]d the people.

Third Conspirator:
The people will [SEQ_SPLITTER]remain uncertain whilst
'Twixt you there's differe[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce; but the fall of either
Makes the survivor hei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r of all.

AUFIDIUS:
I know it;
And my pretext to [SEQ_SPLITTER]strike at him admits
A good construction. I raised[SEQ_SPLITTER] him, and I pawn'd
Mine honour for his truth: who [SEQ_SPLITTER]being so heighten'd,
He water'd his new plants wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h dews of flattery,
Seducing so my friends; and, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o this end,
He bow'd his nature, never known befor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
But to be rough, unswayable and free.

Third Con[SEQ_SPLITTER]spirator:
Sir, his stoutness
When he did stand for[SEQ_SPLITTER] consul, which he lost
By lack of stooping,--

AUF[SEQ_SPLITTER]IDIUS:
That I would have spoke of:
Being banish'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]for't, he came unto my hearth;
Presented to my kni[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe his throat: I took him;
Made him joint-servant [SEQ_SPLITTER]with me; gave him way
In all his own desires; nay,[SEQ_SPLITTER] let him choose
Out of my files, his projects to a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ccomplish,
My best and freshest men; served his de[SEQ_SPLITTER]signments
In mine own person; holp to reap the fam[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Which he did end all his; and took some pride
To[SEQ_SPLITTER] do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
I seem'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] his follower, not partner, and
He waged me with h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is countenance, as if
I had been mercenary.

First[SEQ_SPLITTER] Conspirator:
So he did, my lord:
The army marvell[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d at it, and, in the last,
When he had carried Ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]me and that we look'd
For no less spoil than glory[SEQ_SPLITTER],--

AUFIDIUS:
There was it:
For which my sinews s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of wome[SEQ_SPLITTER]n's rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold the[SEQ_SPLITTER] blood and labour
Of our great action: therefore s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall he die,
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ark!

First Conspirator:
Your native town you ente[SEQ_SPLITTER]r'd like a post,
And had no welcomes home: but he [SEQ_SPLITTER]returns,
Splitting the air with noise.

Second Con[SEQ_SPLITTER]spirator:
And patient fools,
Whose children he hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h slain, their base throats tear
With giving him g[SEQ_SPLITTER]lory.

Third Conspirator:
Therefore, at your vanta[SEQ_SPLITTER]ge,
Ere he express himself, or move the people
Wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h what he would say, let him feel your sword,
Whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h we will second. When he lies along,
After your w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay his tale pronounced shall bury
His reasons with[SEQ_SPLITTER] his body.

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more:
Here come the l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ords.

All The Lords:
You are most welcome home.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]AUFIDIUS:
I have not deserved it.
But, worthy lord[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, have you with heed perused
What I have written [SEQ_SPLITTER]to you?

Lords:
We have.

First Lord:
And grieve t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o hear't.
What faults he made before the last, I t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hink
Might have found easy fines: but there to end[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Where he was to begin and give away
The benefit o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f our levies, answering us
With our own charge, ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]king a treaty where
There was a yielding,--this ad[SEQ_SPLITTER]mits no excuse.

AUFIDIUS:
He approaches: you shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l hear him.

CORIOLANUS:
Hail, lords! I am return'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d your soldier,
No more infected with my country's[SEQ_SPLITTER] love
Than when I parted hence, but still subsisti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng
Under your great command. You are to know
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]prosperously I have attempted and
With bloody pass[SEQ_SPLITTER]age led your wars even to
The gates of Rome. Our s[SEQ_SPLITTER]poils we have brought home
Do more than counterpoi[SEQ_SPLITTER]se a full third part
The charges of the action. We[SEQ_SPLITTER] have made peace
With no less honour to the Antiat[SEQ_SPLITTER]es
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
Together[SEQ_SPLITTER] with the seal o' the senate, what
We have compoun[SEQ_SPLITTER]ded on.

AUFIDIUS:
Read it not, noble lords;
But t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell the traitor, in the high'st degree
He hath abu[SEQ_SPLITTER]sed your powers.

CORIOLANUS:
Traitor! how now!

A[SEQ_SPLITTER]UFIDIUS:
Ay, traitor, Marcius!

CORIOLANUS:
Marciu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s!

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u think
I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy sto[SEQ_SPLITTER]l'n name
Coriolanus in Corioli?
You lords and head[SEQ_SPLITTER]s o' the state, perfidiously
He has betray'd your [SEQ_SPLITTER]business, and given up,
For certain drops of salt,[SEQ_SPLITTER] your city Rome,
I say 'your city,' to his wife an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d mother;
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A [SEQ_SPLITTER]twist of rotten silk, never admitting
Counsel o' t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he war, but at his nurse's tears
He whined and roa[SEQ_SPLITTER]r'd away your victory,
That pages blush'd at him a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd men of heart
Look'd wondering each at other.

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORIOLANUS:
Hear'st thou, Mars?

AUFIDIUS:
Name not[SEQ_SPLITTER] the god, thou boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS:
Ha!

AUF[SEQ_SPLITTER]IDIUS:
No more.

CORIOLANUS:
Measureless liar, tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u hast made my heart
Too great for what contains i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t. Boy! O slave!
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first [SEQ_SPLITTER]time that ever
I was forced to scold. Your judgmen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts, my grave lords,
Must give this cur the lie: an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d his own notion--
Who wears my stripes impress'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his grave--[SEQ_SPLITTER]shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.

First Lord[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Peace, both, and hear me speak.

CORIOLANUS:
Cut[SEQ_SPLITTER] me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur edges on me. Boy! false hound!
If you have writ[SEQ_SPLITTER] your annals true, 'tis there,
That, like an eagle[SEQ_SPLITTER] in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians in Cor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ioli:
Alone I did it. Boy!

AUFIDIUS:
Why, noble l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ords,
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
'[SEQ_SPLITTER]Fore your own eyes and ears?

All Conspirators:
Le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t him die for't.

All The People:
'Tear him to pie[SEQ_SPLITTER]ces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
my son.' 'My d[SEQ_SPLITTER]aughter.' 'He killed my cousin
Marcus.' 'He killed[SEQ_SPLITTER] my father.'

Second Lord:
Peace, ho! no outrage: [SEQ_SPLITTER]peace!
The man is noble and his fame folds-in
This[SEQ_SPLITTER] orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
Shall h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
And troubl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e not the peace.

CORIOLANUS:
O that I had him,
Wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
To use my l[SEQ_SPLITTER]awful sword!

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

All Con[SEQ_SPLITTER]spirators:
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

Lord[SEQ_SPLITTER]s:
Hold, hold, hold, hold!

AUFIDIUS:
My noble mas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ters, hear me speak.

First Lord:
O Tullus,--

Sec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ond Lord:
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l weep.

Third Lord:
Tread not upon him. Masters a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll, be quiet;
Put up your swords.

AUFIDIUS:
My lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rds, when you shall know--as in this rage,
Provoke[SEQ_SPLITTER]d by him, you cannot--the great danger
Which this [SEQ_SPLITTER]man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
That he is [SEQ_SPLITTER]thus cut off. Please it your honours
To call me to[SEQ_SPLITTER] your senate, I'll deliver
Myself your loyal serva[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt, or endure
Your heaviest censure.

First Lord:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Bear from hence his body;
And mourn you for him: l[SEQ_SPLITTER]et him be regarded
As the most noble corse that ev[SEQ_SPLITTER]er herald
Did follow to his urn.

Second Lord:
His[SEQ_SPLITTER] own impatience
Takes from Aufidius a great part o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f blame.
Let's make the best of it.

AUFIDIUS:
My [SEQ_SPLITTER]rage is gone;
And I am struck with sorrow. Take hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m up.
Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e one.
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfull[SEQ_SPLITTER]y:
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
Which to th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is hour bewail the injury,
Yet he shall have a nob[SEQ_SPLITTER]le memory. Assist.

GLOUCESTER:
Now is the winter [SEQ_SPLITTER]of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun[SEQ_SPLITTER] of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our [SEQ_SPLITTER]house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now a[SEQ_SPLITTER]re our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our br[SEQ_SPLITTER]uised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarum[SEQ_SPLITTER]s changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches [SEQ_SPLITTER]to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smoo[SEQ_SPLITTER]th'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mount[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful a[SEQ_SPLITTER]dversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that a[SEQ_SPLITTER]m not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to cour[SEQ_SPLITTER]t an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stam[SEQ_SPLITTER]p'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]nto this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak pipin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the [SEQ_SPLITTER]time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And desca[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I c[SEQ_SPLITTER]annot prove a lover,
To entertain these fair well-[SEQ_SPLITTER]spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ies, libels and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence[SEQ_SPLITTER] and the king
In deadly hate the one against the o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther:
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am subtle, false and treacherous,
This day should [SEQ_SPLITTER]Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prophecy, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich says that 'G'
Of Edward's heirs the murderer s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
Cla[SEQ_SPLITTER]rence comes.
Brother, good day; what means this ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]med guard
That waits upon your grace?

CLARENCE:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]is majesty
Tendering my person's safety, hath appo[SEQ_SPLITTER]inted
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.

GLO[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCESTER:
Upon what cause?

CLARENCE:
Because my na[SEQ_SPLITTER]me is George.

GLOUCESTER:
Alack, my lord, that fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ult is none of yours;
He should, for that, commit [SEQ_SPLITTER]your godfathers:
O, belike his majesty hath some i[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntent
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Towe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r.
But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]CLARENCE:
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest[SEQ_SPLITTER]
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
He hearkens[SEQ_SPLITTER] after prophecies and dreams;
And from the cross-r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow plucks the letter G.
And says a wizard told him[SEQ_SPLITTER] that by G
His issue disinherited should be;
And, [SEQ_SPLITTER]for my name of George begins with G,
It follows in[SEQ_SPLITTER] his thought that I am he.
These, as I learn, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]such like toys as these
Have moved his highness to[SEQ_SPLITTER] commit me now.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, this it is, when[SEQ_SPLITTER] men are ruled by women:
'Tis not the king that se[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds you to the Tower:
My Lady Grey his wife, Clare[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce, 'tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Antho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ny Woodville, her brother there,
That made him sen[SEQ_SPLITTER]d Lord Hastings to the Tower,
From whence this pre[SEQ_SPLITTER]sent day he is deliver'd?
We are not safe, Clarenc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e; we are not safe.

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I think [SEQ_SPLITTER]there's no man is secure
But the queen's kindred a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd night-walking heralds
That trudge betwixt the k[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what an humbl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e suppliant
Lord hastings was to her for his deliv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ery?

GLOUCESTER:
Humbly complaining to her deity
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
I'll tell you[SEQ_SPLITTER] what; I think it is our way,
If we will keep in f[SEQ_SPLITTER]avour with the king,
To be her men and wear her li[SEQ_SPLITTER]very:
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
Sinc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
Are mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghty gossips in this monarchy.

BRAKENBURY:
I bese[SEQ_SPLITTER]ech your graces both to pardon me;
His majesty hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h straitly given in charge
That no man shall have [SEQ_SPLITTER]private conference,
Of what degree soever, with hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s brother.

GLOUCESTER:
Even so; an't please your [SEQ_SPLITTER]worship, Brakenbury,
You may partake of any thing [SEQ_SPLITTER]we say:
We speak no treason, man: we say the king
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
Well str[SEQ_SPLITTER]uck in years, fair, and not jealous;
We say that S[SEQ_SPLITTER]hore's wife hath a pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
And that the q[SEQ_SPLITTER]ueen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
How say you [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir? Can you deny all this?

BRAKENBURY:
With this[SEQ_SPLITTER], my lord, myself have nought to do.

GLOUCESTER:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fel[SEQ_SPLITTER]low,
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Were best he do it secretly, alone.

BRAKENBURY:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat one, my lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Her husband, knave:[SEQ_SPLITTER] wouldst thou betray me?

BRAKENBURY:
I beseech yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur grace to pardon me, and withal
Forbear your con[SEQ_SPLITTER]ference with the noble duke.

CLARENCE:
We know th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

GLOUCESTER:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
Brother[SEQ_SPLITTER], farewell: I will unto the king;
And whatsoever y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou will employ me in,
Were it to call King Edward'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s widow sister,
I will perform it to enfranchise y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou.
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
To[SEQ_SPLITTER]uches me deeper than you can imagine.

CLARENCE:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] know it pleaseth neither of us well.

GLOUCESTER:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
Meanti[SEQ_SPLITTER]me, have patience.

CLARENCE:
I must perforce. Far[SEQ_SPLITTER]ewell.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, tread the path that thou s[SEQ_SPLITTER]halt ne'er return.
Simple, plain Clarence! I do lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve thee so,
That I will shortly send thy soul to h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaven,
If heaven will take the present at our hand[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

HASTINGS:
Good time of day unto my gracious lord[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

GLOUCESTER:
As much unto my good lord chamberla[SEQ_SPLITTER]in!
Well are you welcome to the open air.
How hath[SEQ_SPLITTER] your lordship brook'd imprisonment?

HASTINGS:
Wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
But I [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
That were[SEQ_SPLITTER] the cause of my imprisonment.

GLOUCESTER:
No dou[SEQ_SPLITTER]bt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
For they [SEQ_SPLITTER]that were your enemies are his,
And have prevail'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] as much on him as you.

HASTINGS:
More pity that [SEQ_SPLITTER]the eagle should be mew'd,
While kites and buzzard[SEQ_SPLITTER]s prey at liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
What news abroad?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
HASTINGS:
No news so bad abroad as this at home;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
And his p[SEQ_SPLITTER]hysicians fear him mightily.

GLOUCESTER:
Now, by [SEQ_SPLITTER]Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
O, he hath ke[SEQ_SPLITTER]pt an evil diet long,
And overmuch consumed his ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]yal person:
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
What, is he in his bed?

HASTINGS:
He is.

GLOUCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]STER:
Go you before, and I will follow you.
He can[SEQ_SPLITTER]not live, I hope; and must not die
Till George be [SEQ_SPLITTER]pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
I'll in, to u[SEQ_SPLITTER]rge his hatred more to Clarence,
With lies well st[SEQ_SPLITTER]eel'd with weighty arguments;
And, if I fall not i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n my deep intent,
Clarence hath not another day to[SEQ_SPLITTER] live:
Which done, God take King Edward to his mer[SEQ_SPLITTER]cy,
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
For t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
What t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hough I kill'd her husband and her father?
The rea[SEQ_SPLITTER]diest way to make the wench amends
Is to become he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r husband and her father:
The which will I; not al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l so much for love
As for another secret close int[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent,
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]yet I run before my horse to market:
Clarence stil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
When th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey are gone, then must I count my gains.

LADY ANN[SEQ_SPLITTER]E:
Set down, set down your honourable load,
If hon[SEQ_SPLITTER]our may be shrouded in a hearse,
Whilst I awhile o[SEQ_SPLITTER]bsequiously lament
The untimely fall of virtuous L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ancaster.
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Pal[SEQ_SPLITTER]e ashes of the house of Lancaster!
Thou bloodless [SEQ_SPLITTER]remnant of that royal blood!
Be it lawful that I i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nvocate thy ghost,
To hear the lamentations of Poo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r Anne,
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds!
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
Cursed [SEQ_SPLITTER]be the hand that made these fatal holes!
Cursed be[SEQ_SPLITTER] the heart that had the heart to do it!
Cursed the[SEQ_SPLITTER] blood that let this blood from hence!
More direfu[SEQ_SPLITTER]l hap betide that hated wretch,
That makes us wret[SEQ_SPLITTER]ched by the death of thee,
Than I can wish to adde[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs, spiders, toads,
Or any creeping venom'd thing [SEQ_SPLITTER]that lives!
If ever he have child, abortive be it,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
Whose [SEQ_SPLITTER]ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful m[SEQ_SPLITTER]other at the view;
And that be heir to his unhappi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ness!
If ever he have wife, let her he made
A mise[SEQ_SPLITTER]rable by the death of him
As I am made by my poor [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord and thee!
Come, now towards Chertsey with you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r holy load,
Taken from Paul's to be interred ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e;
And still, as you are weary of the weight,
Rest[SEQ_SPLITTER] you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.

GLOUCES[SEQ_SPLITTER]TER:
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it dow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.

LADY ANNE:
What black magician conjures up thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s fiend,
To stop devoted charitable deeds?

GLOUCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]STER:
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint P[SEQ_SPLITTER]aul,
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.

Gent[SEQ_SPLITTER]leman:
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pas[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.

GLOUCESTER:
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I[SEQ_SPLITTER] command:
Advance thy halbert higher than my breas[SEQ_SPLITTER]t,
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.

L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ADY ANNE:
What, do you tremble? are you all afraid[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
And m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
Avaunt, thou d[SEQ_SPLITTER]readful minister of hell!
Thou hadst but power ove[SEQ_SPLITTER]r his mortal body,
His soul thou canst not have; t[SEQ_SPLITTER]herefore be gone.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet saint, for ch[SEQ_SPLITTER]arity, be not so curst.

LADY ANNE:
Foul devil, fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
For thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]hast made the happy earth thy hell,
Fill'd it with[SEQ_SPLITTER] cursing cries and deep exclaims.
If thou delight [SEQ_SPLITTER]to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this pattern of [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy butcheries.
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s wounds
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed af[SEQ_SPLITTER]resh!
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
From [SEQ_SPLITTER]cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
Thy d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eed, inhuman and unnatural,
Provokes this deluge m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ost unnatural.
O God, which this blood madest, rev[SEQ_SPLITTER]enge his death!
O earth, which this blood drink'st[SEQ_SPLITTER] revenge his death!
Either heaven with lightning s[SEQ_SPLITTER]trike the
murderer dead,
Or earth, gape open wide [SEQ_SPLITTER]and eat him quick,
As thou dost swallow up this go[SEQ_SPLITTER]od king's blood
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath b[SEQ_SPLITTER]utchered!

GLOUCESTER:
Lady, you know no rules of [SEQ_SPLITTER]charity,
Which renders good for bad, blessings for[SEQ_SPLITTER] curses.

LADY ANNE:
Villain, thou know'st no law [SEQ_SPLITTER]of God nor man:
No beast so fierce but knows some [SEQ_SPLITTER]touch of pity.

GLOUCESTER:
But I know none, and t[SEQ_SPLITTER]herefore am no beast.

LADY ANNE:
O wonderful, whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]n devils tell the truth!

GLOUCESTER:
More wonderf[SEQ_SPLITTER]ul, when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, divine pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]rfection of a woman,
Of these supposed-evils, to g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive me leave,
By circumstance, but to acquit mysel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f.

LADY ANNE:
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an,
For these known evils, but to give me leave,
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]y circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.

GLOUCES[SEQ_SPLITTER]TER:
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

LADY ANNE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst mak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

GLOUCES[SEQ_SPLITTER]TER:
By such despair, I should accuse myself.

LAD[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y ANNE:
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand ex[SEQ_SPLITTER]cused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

GLOUCESTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]R:
Say that I slew them not?

LADY ANNE:
Why, then[SEQ_SPLITTER] they are not dead:
But dead they are, and devilis[SEQ_SPLITTER]h slave, by thee.

GLOUCESTER:
I did not kill your[SEQ_SPLITTER] husband.

LADY ANNE:
Why, then he is alive.

GLOU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CESTER:
Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's han[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.

LADY ANNE:
In thy foul throat thou liest: Quee[SEQ_SPLITTER]n Margaret saw
Thy murderous falchion smoking in h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is blood;
The which thou once didst bend against h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er breast,
But that thy brothers beat aside the po[SEQ_SPLITTER]int.

GLOUCESTER:
I was provoked by her slanderous[SEQ_SPLITTER] tongue,
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless [SEQ_SPLITTER]shoulders.

LADY ANNE:
Thou wast provoked by thy b[SEQ_SPLITTER]loody mind.
Which never dreamt on aught but butche[SEQ_SPLITTER]ries:
Didst thou not kill this king?

GLOUCESTER:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I grant ye.

LADY ANNE:
Dost grant me, hedgehog? t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen, God grant me too
Thou mayst be damned for tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t wicked deed!
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s!

GLOUCESTER:
The fitter for the King of heaven,[SEQ_SPLITTER] that hath him.

LADY ANNE:
He is in heaven, where[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou shalt never come.

GLOUCESTER:
Let him thank[SEQ_SPLITTER] me, that holp to send him thither;
For he was fit[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter for that place than earth.

LADY ANNE:
And tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u unfit for any place but hell.

GLOUCESTER:
Yes, [SEQ_SPLITTER]one place else, if you will hear me name it.

LADY[SEQ_SPLITTER] ANNE:
Some dungeon.

GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber[SEQ_SPLITTER].

LADY ANNE:
I'll rest betide the chamber where t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou liest!

GLOUCESTER:
So will it, madam till I l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ie with you.

LADY ANNE:
I hope so.

GLOUCESTER:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this kee[SEQ_SPLITTER]n encounter of our wits,
And fall somewhat into a [SEQ_SPLITTER]slower method,
Is not the causer of the timeless d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaths
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
As [SEQ_SPLITTER]blameful as the executioner?

LADY ANNE:
Thou art [SEQ_SPLITTER]the cause, and most accursed effect.

GLOUCESTER:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Your bea[SEQ_SPLITTER]uty: which did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he death of all the world,
So I might live one hou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r in your sweet bosom.

LADY ANNE:
If I thought th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at, I tell thee, homicide,
These nails should rend[SEQ_SPLITTER] that beauty from my cheeks.

GLOUCESTER:
These ey[SEQ_SPLITTER]es could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
You sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould not blemish it, if I stood by:
As all the wor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld is cheered by the sun,
So I by that; it is my d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, my life.

LADY ANNE:
Black night o'ershade thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] day, and death thy life!

GLOUCESTER:
Curse not t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hyself, fair creature thou art both.

LADY ANNE:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] would I were, to be revenged on thee.

GLOUCESTER[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
To be revenged o[SEQ_SPLITTER]n him that loveth you.

LADY ANNE:
It is a quarrel[SEQ_SPLITTER] just and reasonable,
To be revenged on him that s[SEQ_SPLITTER]lew my husband.

GLOUCESTER:
He that bereft thee, [SEQ_SPLITTER]lady, of thy husband,
Did it to help thee to a bet[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter husband.

LADY ANNE:
His better doth not breat[SEQ_SPLITTER]he upon the earth.

GLOUCESTER:
He lives that love[SEQ_SPLITTER]s thee better than he could.

LADY ANNE:
Name him.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

GLOUCESTER:
Plantagenet.

LADY ANNE:
Why, that w[SEQ_SPLITTER]as he.

GLOUCESTER:
The selfsame name, but one of [SEQ_SPLITTER]better nature.

LADY ANNE:
Where is he?

GLOUCESTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]R:
Here.
Why dost thou spit at me?

LADY ANNE:
Wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld it were mortal poison, for thy sake!

GLOUCESTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]R:
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

LADY [SEQ_SPLITTER]ANNE:
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y sight! thou dost infect my eyes.

GLOUCESTER:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

LADY AN[SEQ_SPLITTER]NE:
Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

GLOUCESTER:
I would they were, that I might die[SEQ_SPLITTER] at once;
For now they kill me with a living death[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ars,
Shamed their aspect with store of childish dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ops:
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, when my father York and Edward wept,
To hear th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-faced [SEQ_SPLITTER]Clifford shook his sword at him;
Nor when thy warl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ike father, like a child,
Told the sad story of my[SEQ_SPLITTER] father's death,
And twenty times made pause to so[SEQ_SPLITTER]b and weep,
That all the standers-by had wet their[SEQ_SPLITTER] cheeks
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad[SEQ_SPLITTER] time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
Thy be[SEQ_SPLITTER]auty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
I nev[SEQ_SPLITTER]er sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never[SEQ_SPLITTER] learn sweet smoothing word;
But now thy beauty is[SEQ_SPLITTER] proposed my fee,
My proud heart sues, and prompts[SEQ_SPLITTER] my tongue to speak.
Teach not thy lips such scorn[SEQ_SPLITTER], for they were made
For kissing, lady, not for su[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch contempt.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgiv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I lay it [SEQ_SPLITTER]naked to the deadly stroke,
And humbly beg the dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]th upon my knee.
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill[SEQ_SPLITTER] King Henry,
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Ed[SEQ_SPLITTER]ward,
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Take up the sword again, or take up me.

LADY ANNE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
I wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll not be the executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
Then bid m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e kill myself, and I will do it.

LADY ANNE:
I hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e already.

GLOUCESTER:
Tush, that was in thy rage[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Speak it again, and, even with the word,
That ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
Shall,[SEQ_SPLITTER] for thy love, kill a far truer love;
To both thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r deaths thou shalt be accessary.

LADY ANNE:
I wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld I knew thy heart.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis figured in[SEQ_SPLITTER] my tongue.

LADY ANNE:
I fear me both are false.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
GLOUCESTER:
Then never man was true.

LADY ANNE:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Well, well, put up your sword.

GLOUCESTER:
Say, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen, my peace is made.

LADY ANNE:
That shall you [SEQ_SPLITTER]know hereafter.

GLOUCESTER:
But shall I live in h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ope?

LADY ANNE:
All men, I hope, live so.

GLOUCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]STER:
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

LADY ANNE:
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]take is not to give.

GLOUCESTER:
Look, how this r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing encompasseth finger.
Even so thy breast enclos[SEQ_SPLITTER]eth my poor heart;
Wear both of them, for both of [SEQ_SPLITTER]them are thine.
And if thy poor devoted suppliant [SEQ_SPLITTER]may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
Thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]dost confirm his happiness for ever.

LADY ANNE:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat is it?

GLOUCESTER:
That it would please thee [SEQ_SPLITTER]leave these sad designs
To him that hath more caus[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to be a mourner,
And presently repair to Crosby [SEQ_SPLITTER]Place;
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
At Ch[SEQ_SPLITTER]ertsey monastery this noble king,
And wet his grav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e with my repentant tears,
I will with all expedie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt duty see you:
For divers unknown reasons. I bes[SEQ_SPLITTER]eech you,
Grant me this boon.

LADY ANNE:
With all[SEQ_SPLITTER] my heart; and much it joys me too,
To see you are[SEQ_SPLITTER] become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go alon[SEQ_SPLITTER]g with me.

GLOUCESTER:
Bid me farewell.

LADY ANN[SEQ_SPLITTER]E:
'Tis more than you deserve;
But since you teach[SEQ_SPLITTER] me how to flatter you,
Imagine I have said farewe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll already.

GLOUCESTER:
Sirs, take up the corse.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
GENTLEMEN:
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?

GLOUCES[SEQ_SPLITTER]TER:
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was ever wom[SEQ_SPLITTER]an in this humour won?
I'll have her; but I will n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot keep her long.
What! I, that kill'd her husband[SEQ_SPLITTER] and his father,
To take her in her heart's extrem[SEQ_SPLITTER]est hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her e[SEQ_SPLITTER]yes,
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
Having[SEQ_SPLITTER] God, her conscience, and these bars
against me,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd I nothing to back my suit at all,
But the plain[SEQ_SPLITTER] devil and dissembling looks,
And yet to win her, [SEQ_SPLITTER]all the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she forgot alre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ady that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]ramed in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant[SEQ_SPLITTER], wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious w[SEQ_SPLITTER]orld cannot again afford
And will she yet debase h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden prime of th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is sweet prince,
And made her widow to a woful bed[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
On [SEQ_SPLITTER]me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
My dukedom to [SEQ_SPLITTER]a beggarly denier,
I do mistake my person all this[SEQ_SPLITTER] while:
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
I'll be at[SEQ_SPLITTER] charges for a looking-glass,
And entertain some s[SEQ_SPLITTER]core or two of tailors,
To study fashions to adorn[SEQ_SPLITTER] my body:
Since I am crept in favour with myself,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Will maintain it with some little cost.
But first [SEQ_SPLITTER]I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
And then return[SEQ_SPLITTER] lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as [SEQ_SPLITTER]I pass.

RIVERS:
Have patience, madam: there's no [SEQ_SPLITTER]doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustom'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] health.

GREY:
In that you brook it in, it makes [SEQ_SPLITTER]him worse:
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain go[SEQ_SPLITTER]od comfort,
And cheer his grace with quick and mer[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry words.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If he were dead, what [SEQ_SPLITTER]would betide of me?

RIVERS:
No other harm but los[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of such a lord.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The loss of su[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch a lord includes all harm.

GREY:
The heavens ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve bless'd you with a goodly son,
To be your comfo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rter when he is gone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Oh, he is [SEQ_SPLITTER]young and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Ri[SEQ_SPLITTER]chard Gloucester,
A man that loves not me, nor non[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of you.

RIVERS:
Is it concluded that he shall b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e protector?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
It is determined, n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot concluded yet:
But so it must be, if the king m[SEQ_SPLITTER]iscarry.

GREY:
Here come the lords of Buckingham [SEQ_SPLITTER]and Derby.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good time of day unto your[SEQ_SPLITTER] royal grace!

DERBY:
God make your majesty joyful[SEQ_SPLITTER] as you have been!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Countess [SEQ_SPLITTER]Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
To your good pray[SEQ_SPLITTER]ers will scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithsta[SEQ_SPLITTER]nding she's your wife,
And loves not me, be you, g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud arr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ogance.

DERBY:
I do beseech you, either not belie[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
Or,[SEQ_SPLITTER] if she be accused in true report,
Bear with her w[SEQ_SPLITTER]eakness, which, I think proceeds
From wayward sick[SEQ_SPLITTER]ness, and no grounded malice.

RIVERS:
Saw you the[SEQ_SPLITTER] king to-day, my Lord of Derby?

DERBY:
But now th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting [SEQ_SPLITTER]his majesty.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What likelihood of [SEQ_SPLITTER]his amendment, lords?

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good hop[SEQ_SPLITTER]e; his grace speaks cheerfully.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]God grant him health! Did you confer with him?

BU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CKINGHAM:
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonem[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs,
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]sent to warn them to his royal presence.

QUEEN EL[SEQ_SPLITTER]IZABETH:
Would all were well! but that will never [SEQ_SPLITTER]be
I fear our happiness is at the highest.

GLOUCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]STER:
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Who are they that complain unto the king,
That I, [SEQ_SPLITTER]forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
By holy Pau[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, they love his grace but lightly
That fill his e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ars with such dissentious rumours.
Because I canno[SEQ_SPLITTER]t flatter and speak fair,
Smile in men's faces, sm[SEQ_SPLITTER]ooth, deceive and cog,
Duck with French nods and a[SEQ_SPLITTER]pish courtesy,
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
C[SEQ_SPLITTER]annot a plain man live and think no harm,
But thus[SEQ_SPLITTER] his simple truth must be abused
By silken, sly, i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nsinuating Jacks?

RIVERS:
To whom in all this pre[SEQ_SPLITTER]sence speaks your grace?

GLOUCESTER:
To thee, tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee? when done thee wrong?
Or thee? or thee? or a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ny of your faction?
A plague upon you all! His roy[SEQ_SPLITTER]al person,--
Whom God preserve better than you wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld wish!--
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-whil[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Brother of Gloucester, you mista[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke the matter.
The king, of his own royal disposit[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion,
And not provoked by any suitor else;
Aiming, [SEQ_SPLITTER]belike, at your interior hatred,
Which in your out[SEQ_SPLITTER]ward actions shows itself
Against my kindred, brot[SEQ_SPLITTER]hers, and myself,
Makes him to send; that thereby [SEQ_SPLITTER]he may gather
The ground of your ill-will, and so [SEQ_SPLITTER]remove it.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell: the world i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s grown so bad,
That wrens make prey where eagles [SEQ_SPLITTER]dare not perch:
Since every Jack became a gentlema[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.

QUEEN[SEQ_SPLITTER] ELIZABETH:
Come, come, we know your meaning, brot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her
Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and my fri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ends':
God grant we never may have need of you!

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]LOUCESTER:
Meantime, God grants that we have need [SEQ_SPLITTER]of you:
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Myself disgraced, and the nobility
Held in contemp[SEQ_SPLITTER]t; whilst many fair promotions
Are daily given to [SEQ_SPLITTER]ennoble those
That scarce, some two days since, we[SEQ_SPLITTER]re worth a noble.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By Him that ra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ised me to this careful height
From that contented[SEQ_SPLITTER] hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did incense his maje[SEQ_SPLITTER]sty
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
An[SEQ_SPLITTER] earnest advocate to plead for him.
My lord, you d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o me shameful injury,
Falsely to draw me in these [SEQ_SPLITTER]vile suspects.

GLOUCESTER:
You may deny that you [SEQ_SPLITTER]were not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings' late impri[SEQ_SPLITTER]sonment.

RIVERS:
She may, my lord, for--

GLOUCES[SEQ_SPLITTER]TER:
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]She may do more, sir, than denying that:
She may h[SEQ_SPLITTER]elp you to many fair preferments,
And then deny he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r aiding hand therein,
And lay those honours on yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur high deserts.
What may she not? She may, yea, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]arry, may she--

RIVERS:
What, marry, may she?

GL[SEQ_SPLITTER]OUCESTER:
What, marry, may she! marry with a king,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
I wis your [SEQ_SPLITTER]grandam had a worser match.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Your blun[SEQ_SPLITTER]t upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
By heaven, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] will acquaint his majesty
With those gross taunts[SEQ_SPLITTER] I often have endured.
I had rather be a country s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ervant-maid
Than a great queen, with this conditio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n,
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
Sma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll joy have I in being England's queen.

QUEEN MAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]GARET:
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee!
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.

GL[SEQ_SPLITTER]OUCESTER:
What! threat you me with telling of the [SEQ_SPLITTER]king?
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have s[SEQ_SPLITTER]aid
I will avouch in presence of the king:
I dare [SEQ_SPLITTER]adventure to be sent to the Tower.
'Tis time to sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]eak; my pains are quite forgot.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut, devil! I remember them too well:
Thou slewest [SEQ_SPLITTER]my husband Henry in the Tower,
And Edward, my poor[SEQ_SPLITTER] son, at Tewksbury.

GLOUCESTER:
Ere you were quee[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, yea, or your husband king,
I was a pack-horse i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n his great affairs;
A weeder-out of his proud adv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ersaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends:
To ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]yalize his blood I spilt mine own.

QUEEN MARGARET[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]LOUCESTER:
In all which time you and your husband [SEQ_SPLITTER]Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
And[SEQ_SPLITTER], Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
In Mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]garet's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me put [SEQ_SPLITTER]in your minds, if you forget,
What you have been e[SEQ_SPLITTER]re now, and what you are;
Withal, what I have been[SEQ_SPLITTER], and what I am.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A murderous vill[SEQ_SPLITTER]ain, and so still thou art.

GLOUCESTER:
Poor Clar[SEQ_SPLITTER]ence did forsake his father, Warwick;
Yea, and for[SEQ_SPLITTER]swore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

QUEEN MARGAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]ET:
Which God revenge!

GLOUCESTER:
To fight on Ed[SEQ_SPLITTER]ward's party for the crown;
And for his meed, poor[SEQ_SPLITTER] lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to God my heart wer[SEQ_SPLITTER]e flint, like Edward's;
Or Edward's soft and pitif[SEQ_SPLITTER]ul, like mine
I am too childish-foolish for this w[SEQ_SPLITTER]orld.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hie thee to hell for shame,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and leave the world,
Thou cacodemon! there thy ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngdom is.

RIVERS:
My Lord of Gloucester, in those[SEQ_SPLITTER] busy days
Which here you urge to prove us enemies[SEQ_SPLITTER],
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
So s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hould we you, if you should be our king.

GLOUCEST[SEQ_SPLITTER]ER:
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
Far [SEQ_SPLITTER]be it from my heart, the thought of it!

QUEEN ELI[SEQ_SPLITTER]ZABETH:
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You[SEQ_SPLITTER] should enjoy, were you this country's king,
As li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ttle joy may you suppose in me.
That I enjoy, bein[SEQ_SPLITTER]g the queen thereof.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A little joy[SEQ_SPLITTER] enjoys the queen thereof;
For I am she, and altog[SEQ_SPLITTER]ether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.
He[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
In sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ring that which you have pill'd from me!
Which of [SEQ_SPLITTER]you trembles not that looks on me?
If not, that, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] being queen, you bow like subjects,
Yet that, by [SEQ_SPLITTER]you deposed, you quake like rebels?
O gentle villa[SEQ_SPLITTER]in, do not turn away!

GLOUCESTER:
Foul wrinkled w[SEQ_SPLITTER]itch, what makest thou in my sight?

QUEEN MARGARE[SEQ_SPLITTER]T:
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
That w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill I make before I let thee go.

GLOUCESTER:
Wert[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou not banished on pain of death?

QUEEN MARGAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]ET:
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]han death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband[SEQ_SPLITTER] and a son thou owest to me;
And thou a kingdom; a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll of you allegiance:
The sorrow that I have, by r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight is yours,
And all the pleasures you usurp are[SEQ_SPLITTER] mine.

GLOUCESTER:
The curse my noble father laid[SEQ_SPLITTER] on thee,
When thou didst crown his warlike brows [SEQ_SPLITTER]with paper
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from[SEQ_SPLITTER] his eyes,
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke [SEQ_SPLITTER]a clout
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty R[SEQ_SPLITTER]utland--
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.

QU[SEQ_SPLITTER]EEN ELIZABETH:
So just is God, to right the innoce[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt.

HASTINGS:
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat babe,
And the most merciless that e'er was hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd of!

RIVERS:
Tyrants themselves wept when it wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s reported.

DORSET:
No man but prophesied revenge[SEQ_SPLITTER] for it.

BUCKINGHAM:
Northumberland, then present[SEQ_SPLITTER], wept to see it.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What were you s[SEQ_SPLITTER]narling all before I came,
Ready to catch each oth[SEQ_SPLITTER]er by the throat,
And turn you all your hatred now[SEQ_SPLITTER] on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h heaven?
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eath,
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould all but answer for that peevish brat?
Can cur[SEQ_SPLITTER]ses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Why, then,[SEQ_SPLITTER] give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
If not[SEQ_SPLITTER] by war, by surfeit die your king,
As ours by murd[SEQ_SPLITTER]er, to make him a king!
Edward thy son, which now [SEQ_SPLITTER]is Prince of Wales,
For Edward my son, which was P[SEQ_SPLITTER]rince of Wales,
Die in his youth by like untimely [SEQ_SPLITTER]violence!
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Long m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
And se[SEQ_SPLITTER]e another, as I see thee now,
Deck'd in thy rights[SEQ_SPLITTER], as thou art stall'd in mine!
Long die thy happy [SEQ_SPLITTER]days before thy death;
And, after many lengthen'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]hours of grief,
Die neither mother, wife, nor Engl[SEQ_SPLITTER]and's queen!
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers [SEQ_SPLITTER]by,
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]as stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat none of you may live your natural age,
But by [SEQ_SPLITTER]some unlook'd accident cut off!

GLOUCESTER:
Have [SEQ_SPLITTER]done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

QUEEN [SEQ_SPLITTER]MARGARET:
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]shalt hear me.
If heaven have any grievous plague [SEQ_SPLITTER]in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee[SEQ_SPLITTER],
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
And t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen hurl down their indignation
On thee, the troub[SEQ_SPLITTER]ler of the poor world's peace!
The worm of conscie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce still begnaw thy soul!
Thy friends suspect for[SEQ_SPLITTER] traitors while thou livest,
And take deep traitor[SEQ_SPLITTER]s for thy dearest friends!
No sleep close up that [SEQ_SPLITTER]deadly eye of thine,
Unless it be whilst some torm[SEQ_SPLITTER]enting dream
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly de[SEQ_SPLITTER]vils!
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The slave of [SEQ_SPLITTER]nature and the son of hell!
Thou slander of thy mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of thy fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's loins!
Thou rag of honour! thou detested--

GL[SEQ_SPLITTER]OUCESTER:
Margaret.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

GLO[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCESTER:
Ha!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call thee not.

GL[SEQ_SPLITTER]OUCESTER:
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, so I did; but look'd for no[SEQ_SPLITTER] reply.
O, let me make the period to my curse!

GL[SEQ_SPLITTER]OUCESTER:
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'[SEQ_SPLITTER]

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus have you breathed your cur[SEQ_SPLITTER]se against yourself.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor painted[SEQ_SPLITTER] queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Why strew'st [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou sugar on that bottled spider,
Whose deadly we[SEQ_SPLITTER]b ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a[SEQ_SPLITTER] knife to kill thyself.
The time will come when th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse that poiso[SEQ_SPLITTER]nous bunchback'd toad.

HASTINGS:
False-boding wom[SEQ_SPLITTER]an, end thy frantic curse,
Lest to thy harm thou m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove our patience.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Foul shame upon[SEQ_SPLITTER] you! you have all moved mine.

RIVERS:
Were you w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell served, you would be taught your duty.

QUEEN [SEQ_SPLITTER]MARGARET:
To serve me well, you all should do me d[SEQ_SPLITTER]uty,
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subject[SEQ_SPLITTER]s:
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that dut[SEQ_SPLITTER]y!

DORSET:
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, master marquess, you are m[SEQ_SPLITTER]alapert:
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce c[SEQ_SPLITTER]urrent.
O, that your young nobility could judge
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
They that [SEQ_SPLITTER]stand high have many blasts to shake them;
And if [SEQ_SPLITTER]they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.

GLOUCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]STER:
Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]quess.

DORSET:
It toucheth you, my lord, as much [SEQ_SPLITTER]as me.

GLOUCESTER:
Yea, and much more: but I was [SEQ_SPLITTER]born so high,
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top[SEQ_SPLITTER],
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.

Q[SEQ_SPLITTER]UEEN MARGARET:
And turns the sun to shade; alas! a[SEQ_SPLITTER]las!
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath[SEQ_SPLITTER] in eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth[SEQ_SPLITTER] in our aery's nest.
O God, that seest it, do not [SEQ_SPLITTER]suffer it!
As it was won with blood, lost be it so[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done! for shame, if not for ch[SEQ_SPLITTER]arity.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Urge neither charity nor s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hame to me:
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
My ch[SEQ_SPLITTER]arity is outrage, life my shame
And in that shame [SEQ_SPLITTER]still live my sorrow's rage.

BUCKINGHAM:
Have don[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, have done.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O princely Buckingh[SEQ_SPLITTER]am I'll kiss thy hand,
In sign of league and amity[SEQ_SPLITTER] with thee:
Now fair befal thee and thy noble hous[SEQ_SPLITTER]e!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
No[SEQ_SPLITTER]r thou within the compass of my curse.

BUCKINGHAM[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The lips [SEQ_SPLITTER]of those that breathe them in the air.

QUEEN MARG[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARET:
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Bucki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngham, take heed of yonder dog!
Look, when he fawn[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, he bites; and when he bites,
His venom tooth wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll rankle to the death:
Have not to do with him, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eware of him;
Sin, death, and hell have set their [SEQ_SPLITTER]marks on him,
And all their ministers attend on hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m.

GLOUCESTER:
What doth she say, my Lord of Buck[SEQ_SPLITTER]ingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that I respect, my gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]acious lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, dost thou scor[SEQ_SPLITTER]n me for my gentle counsel?
And soothe the devil t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat I warn thee from?
O, but remember this another[SEQ_SPLITTER] day,
When he shall split thy very heart with sorr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow,
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
Live e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ach of you the subjects to his hate,
And he to you[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs, and all of you to God's!

HASTINGS:
My hair do[SEQ_SPLITTER]th stand on end to hear her curses.

RIVERS:
And s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.

GLOUCES[SEQ_SPLITTER]TER:
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
She[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath had too much wrong; and I repent
My part the[SEQ_SPLITTER]reof that I have done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]never did her any, to my knowledge.

GLOUCESTER:
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was to[SEQ_SPLITTER]o hot to do somebody good,
That is too cold in thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nking of it now.
Marry, as for Clarence, he is wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l repaid,
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pain[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
God pardon them that are the cause of it!

RIVER[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]pray for them that have done scathe to us.

GLOUCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]STER:
So do I ever:
being well-advised.
For had I [SEQ_SPLITTER]cursed now, I had cursed myself.

CATESBY:
Madam, [SEQ_SPLITTER]his majesty doth call for you,
And for your grace;[SEQ_SPLITTER] and you, my noble lords.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Catesb[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, we come. Lords, will you go with us?

RIVERS:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]adam, we will attend your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
I do[SEQ_SPLITTER] the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s charge of others.
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have[SEQ_SPLITTER] laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gull[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
And say [SEQ_SPLITTER]it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king [SEQ_SPLITTER]against the duke my brother.
Now, they believe it;[SEQ_SPLITTER] and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaug[SEQ_SPLITTER]han, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of s[SEQ_SPLITTER]cripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for e[SEQ_SPLITTER]vil:
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old o[SEQ_SPLITTER]dd ends stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint,[SEQ_SPLITTER] when most I play the devil.
But, soft! here come [SEQ_SPLITTER]my executioners.
How now, my hardy, stout resolved[SEQ_SPLITTER] mates!
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]First Murderer:
We are, my lord; and come to have [SEQ_SPLITTER]the warrant
That we may be admitted where he is.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]GLOUCESTER:
Well thought upon; I have it here abou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t me.
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
Withal obdu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rate, do not hear him plead;
For Clarence is well-[SEQ_SPLITTER]spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts to pity i[SEQ_SPLITTER]f you mark him.

First Murderer:
Tush!
Fear not, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y lord, we will not stand to prate;
Talkers are no[SEQ_SPLITTER] good doers: be assured
We come to use our hands a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd not our tongues.

GLOUCESTER:
Your eyes drop mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]llstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
I like you,[SEQ_SPLITTER] lads; about your business straight;
Go, go, dispa[SEQ_SPLITTER]tch.

First Murderer:
We will, my noble lord.

BRA[SEQ_SPLITTER]KENBURY:
Why looks your grace so heavily today?

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]LARENCE:
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So fu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I a[SEQ_SPLITTER]m a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend anot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of [SEQ_SPLITTER]happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time![SEQ_SPLITTER]

BRAKENBURY:
What was your dream? I long to hear [SEQ_SPLITTER]you tell it.

CLARENCE:
Methoughts that I had brok[SEQ_SPLITTER]en from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]ches: thence we looked toward England,
And cited u[SEQ_SPLITTER]p a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of Yor[SEQ_SPLITTER]k and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we paced [SEQ_SPLITTER]along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Metho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ught that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
St[SEQ_SPLITTER]ruck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
Into[SEQ_SPLITTER] the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! met[SEQ_SPLITTER]hought, what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful n[SEQ_SPLITTER]oise of waters in mine ears!
What ugly sights of d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eath within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand [SEQ_SPLITTER]fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]arl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scat[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead m[SEQ_SPLITTER]en's skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyes did on[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo'd the slimy bot[SEQ_SPLITTER]tom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that la[SEQ_SPLITTER]y scatter'd by.

BRAKENBURY:
Had you such leisure [SEQ_SPLITTER]in the time of death
To gaze upon the secrets of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he deep?

CLARENCE:
Methought I had; and often did[SEQ_SPLITTER] I strive
To yield the ghost: but still the enviou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s flood
Kept in my soul, and would not let it fort[SEQ_SPLITTER]h
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
But s[SEQ_SPLITTER]mother'd it within my panting bulk,
Which almost b[SEQ_SPLITTER]urst to belch it in the sea.

BRAKENBURY:
Awaked y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou not with this sore agony?

CLARENCE:
O, no, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]dream was lengthen'd after life;
O, then began the[SEQ_SPLITTER] tempest to my soul,
Who pass'd, methought, the me[SEQ_SPLITTER]lancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poet[SEQ_SPLITTER]s write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Who cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ied aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark[SEQ_SPLITTER] monarchy afford false Clarence?'
And so he vanish[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d: then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel,[SEQ_SPLITTER] with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d out aloud,
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, p[SEQ_SPLITTER]erjured Clarence,
That stabb'd me in the field by [SEQ_SPLITTER]Tewksbury;
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your [SEQ_SPLITTER]torments!'
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul[SEQ_SPLITTER] fiends
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ear[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
I t[SEQ_SPLITTER]rembling waked, and for a season after
Could not b[SEQ_SPLITTER]elieve but that I was in hell,
Such terrible impre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssion made the dream.

BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord, though it affrighted you;
I promise, I am afr[SEQ_SPLITTER]aid to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE:
O Brakenbury, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I have done those things,
Which now bear evidence [SEQ_SPLITTER]against my soul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he[SEQ_SPLITTER] requites me!
O God! if my deep prayers cannot app[SEQ_SPLITTER]ease thee,
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my g[SEQ_SPLITTER]uiltless wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, g[SEQ_SPLITTER]entle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy, and I [SEQ_SPLITTER]fain would sleep.

BRAKENBURY:
I will, my lord: Go[SEQ_SPLITTER]d give your grace good rest!
Sorrow breaks seasons[SEQ_SPLITTER] and reposing hours,
Makes the night morning, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]the noon-tide night.
Princes have but their tides [SEQ_SPLITTER]for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward[SEQ_SPLITTER] toil;
And, for unfelt imagination,
They often fee[SEQ_SPLITTER]l a world of restless cares:
So that, betwixt thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r tides and low names,
There's nothing differs but[SEQ_SPLITTER] the outward fame.

First Murderer:
Ho! who's here[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

BRAKENBURY:
In God's name what are you, and how[SEQ_SPLITTER] came you hither?

First Murderer:
I would speak w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.

BRAKE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NBURY:
Yea, are you so brief?

Second Murderer:
O [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im our commission; talk no more.

BRAKENBURY:
I am[SEQ_SPLITTER], in this, commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of [SEQ_SPLITTER]Clarence to your hands:
I will not reason what is [SEQ_SPLITTER]meant hereby,
Because I will be guiltless of the m[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaning.
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asl[SEQ_SPLITTER]eep:
I'll to the king; and signify to him
That thu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s I have resign'd my charge to you.

First Murdere[SEQ_SPLITTER]r:
Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Second Murderer:
What, shall we stab him as he sl[SEQ_SPLITTER]eeps?

First Murderer:
No; then he will say 'twas [SEQ_SPLITTER]done cowardly, when he wakes.

Second Murderer:
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]en he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he judgment-day.

First Murderer:
Why, then he wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l say we stabbed him sleeping.

Second Murderer:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind[SEQ_SPLITTER]
of remorse in me.

First Murderer:
What, art thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] afraid?

Second Murderer:
Not to kill him, having[SEQ_SPLITTER] a warrant for it; but to be
damned for killing hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m, from which no warrant can defend us.

First Mur[SEQ_SPLITTER]derer:
I thought thou hadst been resolute.

Second[SEQ_SPLITTER] Murderer:
So I am, to let him live.

First Murder[SEQ_SPLITTER]er:
Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Second Murderer:
I pray thee, stay a while: I hope[SEQ_SPLITTER] my holy humour
will change; 'twas wont to hold me[SEQ_SPLITTER] but while one
would tell twenty.

First Murderer:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
How dost thou feel thyself now?

Second Murderer:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
[SEQ_SPLITTER]within me.

First Murderer:
Remember our reward, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen the deed is done.

Second Murderer:
'Zounds, h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e dies: I had forgot the reward.

First Murderer:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Where is thy conscience now?

Second Murderer:
In [SEQ_SPLITTER]the Duke of Gloucester's purse.

First Murderer:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]o when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy conscience flies out.

Second Murderer:
Let it [SEQ_SPLITTER]go; there's few or none will entertain it.

First [SEQ_SPLITTER]Murderer:
How if it come to thee again?

Second Mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rderer:
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous[SEQ_SPLITTER] thing: it
makes a man a coward: a man cannot stea[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, but it
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it ch[SEQ_SPLITTER]eques him;
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife[SEQ_SPLITTER], but it
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]irit that
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one [SEQ_SPLITTER]full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse[SEQ_SPLITTER] of gold
that I found; it beggars any man that kee[SEQ_SPLITTER]ps it: it
is turned out of all towns and cities fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r a
dangerous thing; and every man that means to l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive
well endeavours to trust to himself and to liv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
without it.

First Murderer:
'Zounds, it is even[SEQ_SPLITTER] now at my elbow, persuading me
not to kill the du[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke.

Second Murderer:
Take the devil in thy mind, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and relieve him not: he
would insinuate with thee [SEQ_SPLITTER]but to make thee sigh.

First Murderer:
Tut, I am [SEQ_SPLITTER]strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
I warran[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thee.

Second Murderer:
Spoke like a tail fellow[SEQ_SPLITTER] that respects his
reputation. Come, shall we to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his gear?

First Murderer:
Take him over the costa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd with the hilts of thy
sword, and then we will c[SEQ_SPLITTER]hop him in the malmsey-butt
in the next room.

Sec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ond Murderer:
O excellent devise! make a sop of hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m.

First Murderer:
Hark! he stirs: shall I strike[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

Second Murderer:
No, first let's reason with hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m.

CLARENCE:
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cu[SEQ_SPLITTER]p of wine.

Second murderer:
You shall have wine e[SEQ_SPLITTER]nough, my lord, anon.

CLARENCE:
In God's name, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at art thou?

Second Murderer:
A man, as you are.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
CLARENCE:
But not, as I am, royal.

Second Murder[SEQ_SPLITTER]er:
Nor you, as we are, loyal.

CLARENCE:
Thy voic[SEQ_SPLITTER]e is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

Second Mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rderer:
My voice is now the king's, my looks mine [SEQ_SPLITTER]own.

CLARENCE:
How darkly and how deadly dost tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u speak!
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?

Bot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h:
To, to, to--

CLARENCE:
To murder me?

Both:
Ay[SEQ_SPLITTER], ay.

CLARENCE:
You scarcely have the hearts to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell me so,
And therefore cannot have the hearts to[SEQ_SPLITTER] do it.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
First Murderer:
Offended us you have not, but the[SEQ_SPLITTER] king.

CLARENCE:
I shall be reconciled to him aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]in.

Second Murderer:
Never, my lord; therefore pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]epare to die.

CLARENCE:
Are you call'd forth from[SEQ_SPLITTER] out a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is [SEQ_SPLITTER]my offence?
Where are the evidence that do accuse [SEQ_SPLITTER]me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
The bit[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Before I be [SEQ_SPLITTER]convict by course of law,
To threaten me with deat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave redemption
By Christ's dear blood shed for our[SEQ_SPLITTER] grievous sins,
That you depart and lay no hands o[SEQ_SPLITTER]n me
The deed you undertake is damnable.

First Mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rderer:
What we will do, we do upon command.

Seco[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd Murderer:
And he that hath commanded is the kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g.

CLARENCE:
Erroneous vassal! the great King of [SEQ_SPLITTER]kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
Spu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for[SEQ_SPLITTER] he holds vengeance in his hands,
To hurl upon the[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir heads that break his law.

Second Murderer:
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
For fal[SEQ_SPLITTER]se forswearing and for murder too:
Thou didst rece[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive the holy sacrament,
To fight in quarrel of the[SEQ_SPLITTER] house of Lancaster.

First Murderer:
And, like a [SEQ_SPLITTER]traitor to the name of God,
Didst break that vow; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and with thy treacherous blade
Unrip'dst the bowel[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of thy sovereign's son.

Second Murderer:
Whom t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou wert sworn to cherish and defend.

First Murde[SEQ_SPLITTER]rer:
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?

CLARE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NCE:
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]He sends ye not to murder me for this
For in this [SEQ_SPLITTER]sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be revenged fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r this deed.
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
He ne[SEQ_SPLITTER]eds no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off thos[SEQ_SPLITTER]e that have offended him.

First Murderer:
Who mad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e thee, then, a bloody minister,
When gallant-spri[SEQ_SPLITTER]nging brave Plantagenet,
That princely novice, was[SEQ_SPLITTER] struck dead by thee?

CLARENCE:
My brother's love[SEQ_SPLITTER], the devil, and my rage.

First Murderer:
Thy bro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther's love, our duty, and thy fault,
Provoke us h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE:
Oh, if you[SEQ_SPLITTER] love my brother, hate not me;
I am his brother, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ack again,
And I will send you to my brother Glouc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ester,
Who shall reward you better for my life
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n Edward will for tidings of my death.

Second Mur[SEQ_SPLITTER]derer:
You are deceived, your brother Gloucester h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ates you.

CLARENCE:
O, no, he loves me, and he ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]lds me dear:
Go you to him from me.

Both:
Ay, so [SEQ_SPLITTER]we will.

CLARENCE:
Tell him, when that our prince[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly father York
Bless'd his three sons with his vic[SEQ_SPLITTER]torious arm,
And charged us from his soul to love [SEQ_SPLITTER]each other,
He little thought of this divided frie[SEQ_SPLITTER]ndship:
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will [SEQ_SPLITTER]weep.

First Murderer:
Ay, millstones; as be lesso[SEQ_SPLITTER]n'd us to weep.

CLARENCE:
O, do not slander him, [SEQ_SPLITTER]for he is kind.

First Murderer:
Right,
As snow in[SEQ_SPLITTER] harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
'Tis he that sen[SEQ_SPLITTER]t us hither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE:
It c[SEQ_SPLITTER]annot be; for when I parted with him,
He hugg'd me[SEQ_SPLITTER] in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
That he would [SEQ_SPLITTER]labour my delivery.

Second Murderer:
Why, so he d[SEQ_SPLITTER]oth, now he delivers thee
From this world's thrald[SEQ_SPLITTER]om to the joys of heaven.

First Murderer:
Make pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace with God, for you must die, my lord.

CLARENCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
To coun[SEQ_SPLITTER]sel me to make my peace with God,
And art thou yet[SEQ_SPLITTER] to thy own soul so blind,
That thou wilt war with[SEQ_SPLITTER] God by murdering me?
Ah, sirs, consider, he that [SEQ_SPLITTER]set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eed.

Second Murderer:
What shall we do?

CLARENCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Relent, and save your souls.

First Murderer:
Re[SEQ_SPLITTER]lent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.

CLARENCE:
Not t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Which of yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u, if you were a prince's son,
Being pent from lib[SEQ_SPLITTER]erty, as I am now,
if two such murderers as yourse[SEQ_SPLITTER]lves came to you,
Would not entreat for life?
My f[SEQ_SPLITTER]riend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ye be not a flatterer,
Come thou on my side, and e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntreat for me,
As you would beg, were you in my di[SEQ_SPLITTER]stress
A begging prince what beggar pities not?

S[SEQ_SPLITTER]econd Murderer:
Look behind you, my lord.

First M[SEQ_SPLITTER]urderer:
Take that, and that: if all this will not[SEQ_SPLITTER] do,
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.

S[SEQ_SPLITTER]econd Murderer:
A bloody deed, and desperately dis[SEQ_SPLITTER]patch'd!
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!

Fir[SEQ_SPLITTER]st Murderer:
How now! what mean'st thou, that thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] help'st me not?
By heavens, the duke shall know h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow slack thou art!

Second Murderer:
I would he kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ew that I had saved his brother!
Take thou the fee[SEQ_SPLITTER], and tell him what I say;
For I repent me that th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e duke is slain.

First Murderer:
So do not I: go,[SEQ_SPLITTER] coward as thou art.
Now must I hide his body in s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome hole,
Until the duke take order for his burial[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
And when I have my meed, I must away;
For this w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill out, and here I must not stay.

KING EDWARD IV[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
You [SEQ_SPLITTER]peers, continue this united league:
I every day ex[SEQ_SPLITTER]pect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me he[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce;
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
Dissem[SEQ_SPLITTER]ble not your hatred, swear your love.

RIVERS:
By [SEQ_SPLITTER]heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] with my hand I seal my true heart's love.

HASTIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]GS:
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!

KING [SEQ_SPLITTER]EDWARD IV:
Take heed you dally not before your kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g;
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
Confo[SEQ_SPLITTER]und your hidden falsehood, and award
Either of you[SEQ_SPLITTER] to be the other's end.

HASTINGS:
So prosper I, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s I swear perfect love!

RIVERS:
And I, as I love [SEQ_SPLITTER]Hastings with my heart!

KING EDWARD IV:
Madam, yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]urself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son Dorset[SEQ_SPLITTER], Buckingham, nor you;
You have been factious one [SEQ_SPLITTER]against the other,
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im kiss your hand;
And what you do, do it unfeigne[SEQ_SPLITTER]dly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here, Hastings; I will neve[SEQ_SPLITTER]r more remember
Our former hatred, so thrive I and[SEQ_SPLITTER] mine!

KING EDWARD IV:
Dorset, embrace him; Hasti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngs, love lord marquess.

DORSET:
This interchange[SEQ_SPLITTER] of love, I here protest,
Upon my part shall be un[SEQ_SPLITTER]violable.

HASTINGS:
And so swear I, my lord

KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] EDWARD IV:
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is league
With thy embracements to my wife's allie[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
And make me happy in your unity.

BUCKINGHAM:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]henever Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]urs,
but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d yours, God punish me
With hate in those where I [SEQ_SPLITTER]expect most love!
When I have most need to employ [SEQ_SPLITTER]a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend
Dee[SEQ_SPLITTER]p, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
Be he u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nto me! this do I beg of God,
When I am cold in ze[SEQ_SPLITTER]al to yours.

KING EDWARD IV:
A pleasing cordial, [SEQ_SPLITTER]princely Buckingham,
is this thy vow unto my sickl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y heart.
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester [SEQ_SPLITTER]here,
To make the perfect period of this peace.

B[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCKINGHAM:
And, in good time, here comes the noble[SEQ_SPLITTER] duke.

GLOUCESTER:
Good morrow to my sovereign ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng and queen:
And, princely peers, a happy time of[SEQ_SPLITTER] day!

KING EDWARD IV:
Happy, indeed, as we have s[SEQ_SPLITTER]pent the day.
Brother, we done deeds of charity;
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ade peace enmity, fair love of hate,
Between these[SEQ_SPLITTER] swelling wrong-incensed peers.

GLOUCESTER:
A ble[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssed labour, my most sovereign liege:
Amongst this[SEQ_SPLITTER] princely heap, if any here,
By false intelligence[SEQ_SPLITTER], or wrong surmise,
Hold me a foe;
If I unwittingl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, or in my rage,
Have aught committed that is har[SEQ_SPLITTER]dly borne
By any in this presence, I desire
To rec[SEQ_SPLITTER]oncile me to his friendly peace:
'Tis death to me [SEQ_SPLITTER]to be at enmity;
I hate it, and desire all good me[SEQ_SPLITTER]n's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
If ever any gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]udge were lodged between us;
Of you, Lord Rivers, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and, Lord Grey, of you;
That without desert have f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rown'd on me;
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; inde[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed, of all.
I do not know that Englishman alive
Wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nfant that is born to-night
I thank my God for my [SEQ_SPLITTER]humility.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
A holy day shall this [SEQ_SPLITTER]be kept hereafter:
I would to God all strifes were[SEQ_SPLITTER] well compounded.
My sovereign liege, I do beseech[SEQ_SPLITTER] your majesty
To take our brother Clarence to your[SEQ_SPLITTER] grace.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, madam, have I offer'd lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve for this
To be so bouted in this royal presence[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
You d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o him injury to scorn his corse.

RIVERS:
Who know[SEQ_SPLITTER]s not he is dead! who knows he is?

QUEEN ELIZABET[SEQ_SPLITTER]H:
All seeing heaven, what a world is this!

BUCKI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NGHAM:
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]DORSET:
Ay, my good lord; and no one in this prese[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING EDWARD IV:
Is Clarence dead? the order was rev[SEQ_SPLITTER]ersed.

GLOUCESTER:
But he, poor soul, by your fir[SEQ_SPLITTER]st order died,
And that a winged Mercury did bear:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
That cam[SEQ_SPLITTER]e too lag to see him buried.
God grant that some, [SEQ_SPLITTER]less noble and less loyal,
Nearer in bloody though[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts, but not in blood,
Deserve not worse than wretc[SEQ_SPLITTER]hed Clarence did,
And yet go current from suspicio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n!

DORSET:
A boon, my sovereign, for my service d[SEQ_SPLITTER]one!

KING EDWARD IV:
I pray thee, peace: my soul [SEQ_SPLITTER]is full of sorrow.

DORSET:
I will not rise, unles[SEQ_SPLITTER]s your highness grant.

KING EDWARD IV:
Then speak[SEQ_SPLITTER] at once what is it thou demand'st.

DORSET:
The f[SEQ_SPLITTER]orfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
Who slew [SEQ_SPLITTER]to-day a righteous gentleman
Lately attendant on t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he Duke of Norfolk.

KING EDWARD IV:
Have a tongue[SEQ_SPLITTER] to doom my brother's death,
And shall the same gi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve pardon to a slave?
My brother slew no man; his [SEQ_SPLITTER]fault was thought,
And yet his punishment was crue[SEQ_SPLITTER]l death.
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
Who spa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke of brotherhood? who spake of love?
Who told me [SEQ_SPLITTER]how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and did fight for me?
Who told me, in the field by[SEQ_SPLITTER] Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]o told me, when we both lay in the field
Frozen al[SEQ_SPLITTER]most to death, how he did lap me
Even in his own g[SEQ_SPLITTER]arments, and gave himself,
All thin and naked, to [SEQ_SPLITTER]the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance [SEQ_SPLITTER]brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
But whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]n your carters or your waiting-vassals
Have done a[SEQ_SPLITTER] drunken slaughter, and defaced
The precious image[SEQ_SPLITTER] of our dear Redeemer,
You straight are on your kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ees for pardon, pardon;
And I unjustly too, must g[SEQ_SPLITTER]rant it you
But for my brother not a man would spe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ak,
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
For him, [SEQ_SPLITTER]poor soul. The proudest of you all
Have been behol[SEQ_SPLITTER]ding to him in his life;
Yet none of you would onc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e plead for his life.
O God, I fear thy justice wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll take hold
On me, and you, and mine, and yours f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
Oh,[SEQ_SPLITTER] poor Clarence!

GLOUCESTER:
This is the fruit of [SEQ_SPLITTER]rashness! Mark'd you not
How that the guilty kindr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed of the queen
Look'd pale when they did hear of [SEQ_SPLITTER]Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e king!
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To comfort Edward with our company.

BUCKINGHAM:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]e wait upon your grace.

Boy:
Tell me, good granda[SEQ_SPLITTER]m, is our father dead?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, boy.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Boy:
Why do you wring your hands, and beat your b[SEQ_SPLITTER]reast,
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'

Girl[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]call us wretches, orphans, castaways
If that our n[SEQ_SPLITTER]oble father be alive?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My pretty [SEQ_SPLITTER]cousins, you mistake me much;
I do lament the sick[SEQ_SPLITTER]ness of the king.
As loath to lose him, not your f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t's lost.

Boy:
Then, grandam, you conclude that h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e is dead.
The king my uncle is to blame for this:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
God will revenge it; whom I will importune
With d[SEQ_SPLITTER]aily prayers all to that effect.

Girl:
And so wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l I.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Peace, children, peace! the[SEQ_SPLITTER] king doth love you well:
Incapable and shallow in[SEQ_SPLITTER]nocents,
You cannot guess who caused your father's[SEQ_SPLITTER] death.

Boy:
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle G[SEQ_SPLITTER]loucester
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Devised impeachments to imprison him :
And when [SEQ_SPLITTER]my uncle told me so, he wept,
And hugg'd me in his[SEQ_SPLITTER] arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
Bade me rely on [SEQ_SPLITTER]him as on my father,
And he would love me dearly a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s his child.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Oh, that deceit sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld steal such gentle shapes,
And with a virtuous [SEQ_SPLITTER]vizard hide foul guile!
He is my son; yea, and the[SEQ_SPLITTER]rein my shame;
Yet from my dugs he drew not this d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eceit.

Boy:
Think you my uncle did dissemble, gra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ndam?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ay, boy.

Boy:
I cannot th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ink it. Hark! what noise is this?

QUEEN ELIZABETH[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
To chi[SEQ_SPLITTER]de my fortune, and torment myself?
I'll join with [SEQ_SPLITTER]black despair against my soul,
And to myself becom[SEQ_SPLITTER]e an enemy.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What means this scen[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of rude impatience?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To make an[SEQ_SPLITTER] act of tragic violence:
Edward, my lord, your son[SEQ_SPLITTER], our king, is dead.
Why grow the branches now the[SEQ_SPLITTER] root is wither'd?
Why wither not the leaves the s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ap being gone?
If you will live, lament; if die, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e brief,
That our swift-winged souls may catch the[SEQ_SPLITTER] king's;
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
To[SEQ_SPLITTER] his new kingdom of perpetual rest.

DUCHESS OF YO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RK:
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I[SEQ_SPLITTER] had title in thy noble husband!
I have bewept a w[SEQ_SPLITTER]orthy husband's death,
And lived by looking on his[SEQ_SPLITTER] images:
But now two mirrors of his princely sembl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] I for comfort have but one false glass,
Which gri[SEQ_SPLITTER]eves me when I see my shame in him.
Thou art a wid[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow; yet thou art a mother,
And hast the comfort of[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy children left thee:
But death hath snatch'd m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y husband from mine arms,
And pluck'd two crutches[SEQ_SPLITTER] from my feeble limbs,
Edward and Clarence. O, wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t cause have I,
Thine being but a moiety of my gri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ef,
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!

Bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]y:
Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?

Girl:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
Your w[SEQ_SPLITTER]idow-dolour likewise be unwept!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Give me no help in lamentation;
I am not barren to[SEQ_SPLITTER] bring forth complaints
All springs reduce their c[SEQ_SPLITTER]urrents to mine eyes,
That I, being govern'd by th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e watery moon,
May send forth plenteous tears to d[SEQ_SPLITTER]rown the world!
Oh for my husband, for my dear lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d Edward!

Children:
Oh for our father, for our de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar lord Clarence!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alas for both,[SEQ_SPLITTER] both mine, Edward and Clarence!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.

Child[SEQ_SPLITTER]ren:
What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What stays had I but they? and [SEQ_SPLITTER]they are gone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Was never widow h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad so dear a loss!

Children:
Were never orphans h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad so dear a loss!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Was never mot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her had so dear a loss!
Alas, I am the mother of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hese moans!
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are gen[SEQ_SPLITTER]eral.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
I for [SEQ_SPLITTER]a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
These babes for [SEQ_SPLITTER]Clarence weep and so do I;
I for an Edward weep, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o do not they:
Alas, you three, on me, threefold d[SEQ_SPLITTER]istress'd,
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's[SEQ_SPLITTER] nurse,
And I will pamper it with lamentations.

D[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORSET:
Comfort, dear mother: God is much displease[SEQ_SPLITTER]d
That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
In[SEQ_SPLITTER] common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
Wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th dull unwilligness to repay a debt
Which with a [SEQ_SPLITTER]bounteous hand was kindly lent;
Much more to be th[SEQ_SPLITTER]us opposite with heaven,
For it requires the royal[SEQ_SPLITTER] debt it lent you.

RIVERS:
Madam, bethink you, li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke a careful mother,
Of the young prince your son:[SEQ_SPLITTER] send straight for him
Let him be crown'd; in him [SEQ_SPLITTER]your comfort lives:
Drown desperate sorrow in dead[SEQ_SPLITTER] Edward's grave,
And plant your joys in living Edw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard's throne.

GLOUCESTER:
Madam, have comfort: al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing star;
But none can cure their harms by wailing[SEQ_SPLITTER] them.
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
I did[SEQ_SPLITTER] not see your grace: humbly on my knee
I crave you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r blessing.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
God bless thee; and [SEQ_SPLITTER]put meekness in thy mind,
Love, charity, obedience[SEQ_SPLITTER], and true duty!

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
You clo[SEQ_SPLITTER]udy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
That bear t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his mutual heavy load of moan,
Now cheer each othe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r in each other's love
Though we have spent our ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]rvest of this king,
We are to reap the harvest of [SEQ_SPLITTER]his son.
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rts,
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd toget[SEQ_SPLITTER]her,
Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]orthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ither to London, to be crown'd our king.

RIVERS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude[SEQ_SPLITTER],
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Which would be so much the more dangerous
By how [SEQ_SPLITTER]much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
Where[SEQ_SPLITTER] every horse bears his commanding rein,
And may di[SEQ_SPLITTER]rect his course as please himself,
As well the fea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r of harm, as harm apparent,
In my opinion, ought [SEQ_SPLITTER]to be prevented.

GLOUCESTER:
I hope the king made[SEQ_SPLITTER] peace with all of us
And the compact is firm and [SEQ_SPLITTER]true in me.

RIVERS:
And so in me; and so, I think[SEQ_SPLITTER], in all:
Yet, since it is but green, it should be[SEQ_SPLITTER] put
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
Which ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ply by much company might be urged:
Therefore I sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y with noble Buckingham,
That it is meet so few sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould fetch the prince.

HASTINGS:
And so say I.

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]LOUCESTER:
Then be it so; and go we to determine
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ho they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlo[SEQ_SPLITTER]w.
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
To give [SEQ_SPLITTER]your censures in this weighty business?

QUEEN ELI[SEQ_SPLITTER]ZABETH:
With all our harts.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, [SEQ_SPLITTER]whoever journeys to the Prince,
For God's sake, le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t not us two be behind;
For, by the way, I'll sort[SEQ_SPLITTER] occasion,
As index to the story we late talk'd of[SEQ_SPLITTER],
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

GLOUCESTER:
My other self, my counsel's consisto[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry,
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
I, like[SEQ_SPLITTER] a child, will go by thy direction.
Towards Ludlow[SEQ_SPLITTER] then, for we'll not stay behind.

First Citizen:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?

Second[SEQ_SPLITTER] Citizen:
I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ear you the news abroad?

First Citizen:
Ay, that [SEQ_SPLITTER]the king is dead.

Second Citizen:
Bad news, by'r [SEQ_SPLITTER]lady; seldom comes the better:
I fear, I fear 'twi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll prove a troublous world.

Third Citizen:
Neighb[SEQ_SPLITTER]ours, God speed!

First Citizen:
Give you good mor[SEQ_SPLITTER]row, sir.

Third Citizen:
Doth this news hold of g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood King Edward's death?

Second Citizen:
Ay, sir,[SEQ_SPLITTER] it is too true; God help the while!

Third Citize[SEQ_SPLITTER]n:
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]First Citizen:
No, no; by God's good grace his son[SEQ_SPLITTER] shall reign.

Third Citizen:
Woe to the land that[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s govern'd by a child!

Second Citizen:
In him th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere is a hope of government,
That in his nonage co[SEQ_SPLITTER]uncil under him,
And in his full and ripen'd years[SEQ_SPLITTER] himself,
No doubt, shall then and till then gover[SEQ_SPLITTER]n well.

First Citizen:
So stood the state when He[SEQ_SPLITTER]nry the Sixth
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine mon[SEQ_SPLITTER]ths old.

Third Citizen:
Stood the state so? No, n[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, good friends, God wot;
For then this land was f[SEQ_SPLITTER]amously enrich'd
With politic grave counsel; then [SEQ_SPLITTER]the king
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

First Citizen:
Why, so hath this, both by the fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther and mother.

Third Citizen:
Better it were th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey all came by the father,
Or by the father there [SEQ_SPLITTER]were none at all;
For emulation now, who shall be [SEQ_SPLITTER]nearest,
Will touch us all too near, if God preven[SEQ_SPLITTER]t not.
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester[SEQ_SPLITTER]!
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ud:
And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is sickly land might solace as before.

First Citi[SEQ_SPLITTER]zen:
Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell.

Third Citizen:
When clouds appear, wise men [SEQ_SPLITTER]put on their cloaks;
When great leaves fall, the w[SEQ_SPLITTER]inter is at hand;
When the sun sets, who doth not [SEQ_SPLITTER]look for night?
Untimely storms make men expect a [SEQ_SPLITTER]dearth.
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
'[SEQ_SPLITTER]Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.

Second Cit[SEQ_SPLITTER]izen:
Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]e cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eavily and full of fear.

Third Citizen:
Before th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e times of change, still is it so:
By a divine ins[SEQ_SPLITTER]tinct men's minds mistrust
Ensuing dangers; as by [SEQ_SPLITTER]proof, we see
The waters swell before a boisterous[SEQ_SPLITTER] storm.
But leave it all to God. whither away?

Se[SEQ_SPLITTER]cond Citizen:
Marry, we were sent for to the justi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ces.

Third Citizen:
And so was I: I'll bear you c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ompany.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Last night, I hear, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hey lay at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey be to-night:
To-morrow, or next day, they will [SEQ_SPLITTER]be here.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I long with all my hear[SEQ_SPLITTER]t to see the prince:
I hope he is much grown since[SEQ_SPLITTER] last I saw him.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But I hear, no;[SEQ_SPLITTER] they say my son of York
Hath almost overta'en him[SEQ_SPLITTER] in his growth.

YORK:
Ay, mother; but I would not[SEQ_SPLITTER] have it so.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, my young cousi[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, it is good to grow.

YORK:
Grandam, one night, [SEQ_SPLITTER]as we did sit at supper,
My uncle Rivers talk'd ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w I did grow
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my [SEQ_SPLITTER]uncle
Gloucester,
'Small herbs have grace, great w[SEQ_SPLITTER]eeds do grow apace:'
And since, methinks, I would [SEQ_SPLITTER]not grow so fast,
Because sweet flowers are slow a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd weeds make haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Good faith,[SEQ_SPLITTER] good faith, the saying did not hold
In him that d[SEQ_SPLITTER]id object the same to thee;
He was the wretched'st[SEQ_SPLITTER] thing when he was young,
So long a-growing and so[SEQ_SPLITTER] leisurely,
That, if this rule were true, he shoul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d be gracious.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Why, madam, so[SEQ_SPLITTER], no doubt, he is.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I hope he is;[SEQ_SPLITTER] but yet let mothers doubt.

YORK:
Now, by my trot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h, if I had been remember'd,
I could have given my[SEQ_SPLITTER] uncle's grace a flout,
To touch his growth nearer[SEQ_SPLITTER] than he touch'd mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
How, my p[SEQ_SPLITTER]retty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.

YORK:
Ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]rry, they say my uncle grew so fast
That he could [SEQ_SPLITTER]gnaw a crust at two hours old
'Twas full two years[SEQ_SPLITTER] ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam, this would have[SEQ_SPLITTER] been a biting jest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I pray thee[SEQ_SPLITTER], pretty York, who told thee this?

YORK:
Grandam,[SEQ_SPLITTER] his nurse.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
His nurse! why, she [SEQ_SPLITTER]was dead ere thou wert born.

YORK:
If 'twere not [SEQ_SPLITTER]she, I cannot tell who told me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.

ARCHBIS[SEQ_SPLITTER]HOP OF YORK:
Good madam, be not angry with the chi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Pitchers have ears.

ARCHBIS[SEQ_SPLITTER]HOP OF YORK:
Here comes a messenger. What news?

M[SEQ_SPLITTER]essenger:
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unf[SEQ_SPLITTER]old.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How fares the prince?

Mess[SEQ_SPLITTER]enger:
Well, madam, and in health.

DUCHESS OF YOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]K:
What is thy news then?

Messenger:
Lord Rivers [SEQ_SPLITTER]and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
With them Sir T[SEQ_SPLITTER]homas Vaughan, prisoners.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th committed them?

Messenger:
The mighty dukes
Gl[SEQ_SPLITTER]oucester and Buckingham.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
For wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t offence?

Messenger:
The sum of all I can, I hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e disclosed;
Why or for what these nobles were com[SEQ_SPLITTER]mitted
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.

QU[SEQ_SPLITTER]EEN ELIZABETH:
Ay me, I see the downfall of our ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]use!
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
In[SEQ_SPLITTER]sulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d aweless throne:
Welcome, destruction, death, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] massacre!
I see, as in a map, the end of all.

DU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CHESS OF YORK:
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days[SEQ_SPLITTER],
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
My husban[SEQ_SPLITTER]d lost his life to get the crown;
And often up and[SEQ_SPLITTER] down my sons were toss'd,
For me to joy and weep [SEQ_SPLITTER]their gain and loss:
And being seated, and domesti[SEQ_SPLITTER]c broils
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquer[SEQ_SPLITTER]ors.
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Self against self: O, preposterous
And frantic o[SEQ_SPLITTER]utrage, end thy damned spleen;
Or let me die, to l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ook on death no more!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come[SEQ_SPLITTER], my boy; we will to sanctuary.
Madam, farewell.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]DUCHESS OF YORK:
I'll go along with you.

QUEEN EL[SEQ_SPLITTER]IZABETH:
You have no cause.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]y gracious lady, go;
And thither bear your treasur[SEQ_SPLITTER]e and your goods.
For my part, I'll resign unto yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur grace
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
As w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell I tender you and all of yours!
Come, I'll cond[SEQ_SPLITTER]uct you to the sanctuary.

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sw[SEQ_SPLITTER]eet prince, to London, to your chamber.

GLOUCESTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]R:
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e weary way hath made you melancholy.

PRINCE EDWA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD:
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
Have mad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
I want more unc[SEQ_SPLITTER]les here to welcome me.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet prince,[SEQ_SPLITTER] the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ived into the world's deceit
Nor more can you dist[SEQ_SPLITTER]inguish of a man
Than of his outward show; which, [SEQ_SPLITTER]God he knows,
Seldom or never jumpeth with the hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur grace attended to their sugar'd words,
But look[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d not on the poison of their hearts :
God keep yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u from them, and from such false friends!

PRINCE [SEQ_SPLITTER]EDWARD:
God keep me from false friends! but they w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere none.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, the mayor of Londo[SEQ_SPLITTER]n comes to greet you.

Lord Mayor:
God bless your [SEQ_SPLITTER]grace with health and happy days!

PRINCE EDWARD:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
I th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ought my mother, and my brother York,
Would long e[SEQ_SPLITTER]re this have met us on the way
Fie, what a slug is[SEQ_SPLITTER] Hastings, that he comes not
To tell us whether th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey will come or no!

BUCKINGHAM:
And, in good time[SEQ_SPLITTER], here comes the sweating lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
We[SEQ_SPLITTER]lcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?

HASTI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NGS:
On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
The qu[SEQ_SPLITTER]een your mother, and your brother York,
Have taken[SEQ_SPLITTER] sanctuary: the tender prince
Would fain have come[SEQ_SPLITTER] with me to meet your grace,
But by his mother was[SEQ_SPLITTER] perforce withheld.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fie, what an indi[SEQ_SPLITTER]rect and peevish course
Is this of hers! Lord card[SEQ_SPLITTER]inal, will your grace
Persuade the queen to send t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presentl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y?
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
And fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

CARDINAL:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
Can fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m his mother win the Duke of York,
Anon expect him[SEQ_SPLITTER] here; but if she be obdurate
To mild entreaties, [SEQ_SPLITTER]God in heaven forbid
We should infringe the holy p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rivilege
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this la[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.

BUCKINGHAM[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
Too c[SEQ_SPLITTER]eremonious and traditional
Weigh it but with the g[SEQ_SPLITTER]rossness of this age,
You break not sanctuary in s[SEQ_SPLITTER]eizing him.
The benefit thereof is always granted
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd those who have the wit to claim the place:
This[SEQ_SPLITTER] prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
The[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, taking him from thence that is not there,
You b[SEQ_SPLITTER]reak no privilege nor charter there.
Oft have I he[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard of sanctuary men;
But sanctuary children ne'er[SEQ_SPLITTER] till now.

CARDINAL:
My lord, you shall o'er-rule[SEQ_SPLITTER] my mind for once.
Come on, Lord Hastings, will yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u go with me?

HASTINGS:
I go, my lord.

PRINCE ED[SEQ_SPLITTER]WARD:
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
Whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]re shall we sojourn till our coronation?

GLOUCEST[SEQ_SPLITTER]ER:
Where it seems best unto your royal self.
If I[SEQ_SPLITTER] may counsel you, some day or two
Your highness sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all repose you at the Tower:
Then where you please[SEQ_SPLITTER], and shall be thought most fit
For your best heal[SEQ_SPLITTER]th and recreation.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I do not like t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he Tower, of any place.
Did Julius Caesar build th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at place, my lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
He did, my graciou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s lord, begin that place;
Which, since, succeeding[SEQ_SPLITTER] ages have re-edified.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Is it upon [SEQ_SPLITTER]record, or else reported
Successively from age to [SEQ_SPLITTER]age, he built it?

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon record, my gra[SEQ_SPLITTER]cious lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
But say, my lord, it w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere not register'd,
Methinks the truth should live[SEQ_SPLITTER] from age to age,
As 'twere retail'd to all poster[SEQ_SPLITTER]ity,
Even to the general all-ending day.

GLOUCEST[SEQ_SPLITTER]ER:

PRINCE EDWARD:
What say you, uncle?

GLOUCEST[SEQ_SPLITTER]ER:
I say, without characters, fame lives long.
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]us, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two[SEQ_SPLITTER] meanings in one word.

PRINCE EDWARD:
That Julius[SEQ_SPLITTER] Caesar was a famous man;
With what his valour did[SEQ_SPLITTER] enrich his wit,
His wit set down to make his valo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur live
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
I'l[SEQ_SPLITTER]l tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--

BUCKINGH[SEQ_SPLITTER]AM:
What, my gracious lord?

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if [SEQ_SPLITTER]I live until I be a man,
I'll win our ancient righ[SEQ_SPLITTER]t in France again,
Or die a soldier, as I lived a [SEQ_SPLITTER]king.

GLOUCESTER:

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, in good time,[SEQ_SPLITTER] here comes the Duke of York.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Rich[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard of York! how fares our loving brother?

YORK:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.

PRIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]CE EDWARD:
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is you[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs:
Too late he died that might have kept that tit[SEQ_SPLITTER]le,
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.

GL[SEQ_SPLITTER]OUCESTER:
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

YORK:
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u said that idle weeds are fast in growth
The prin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce my brother hath outgrown me far.

GLOUCESTER:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hath, my lord.

YORK:
And therefore is he idle?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
GLOUCESTER:
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

YORK:
Then is he more beholding to you than I.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]GLOUCESTER:
He may command me as my sovereign;
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] you have power in me as in a kinsman.

YORK:
I pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay you, uncle, give me this dagger.

GLOUCESTER:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]y dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.

PRINC[SEQ_SPLITTER]E EDWARD:
A beggar, brother?

YORK:
Of my kind unc[SEQ_SPLITTER]le, that I know will give;
And being but a toy, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich is no grief to give.

GLOUCESTER:
A greater gi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ft than that I'll give my cousin.

YORK:
A greater[SEQ_SPLITTER] gift! O, that's the sword to it.

GLOUCESTER:
A g[SEQ_SPLITTER]entle cousin, were it light enough.

YORK:
O, then[SEQ_SPLITTER], I see, you will part but with light gifts;
In we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ightier things you'll say a beggar nay.

GLOUCESTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]R:
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.

YORK:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

GLOUCESTER:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]What, would you have my weapon, little lord?

YORK[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
GLOUCESTER:
How?

YORK:
Little.

PRINCE EDWARD:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]y Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
Uncle,[SEQ_SPLITTER] your grace knows how to bear with him.

YORK:
You[SEQ_SPLITTER] mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
Uncle, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]brother mocks both you and me;
Because that I am l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ittle, like an ape,
He thinks that you should bear[SEQ_SPLITTER] me on your shoulders.

BUCKINGHAM:
With what a sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]arp-provided wit he reasons!
To mitigate the scorn[SEQ_SPLITTER] he gives his uncle,
He prettily and aptly taunts [SEQ_SPLITTER]himself:
So cunning and so young is wonderful.

GL[SEQ_SPLITTER]OUCESTER:
My lord, will't please you pass along?
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]yself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your m[SEQ_SPLITTER]other, to entreat of her
To meet you at the Tower [SEQ_SPLITTER]and welcome you.

YORK:
What, will you go unto the[SEQ_SPLITTER] Tower, my lord?

PRINCE EDWARD:
My lord protector[SEQ_SPLITTER] needs will have it so.

YORK:
I shall not sleep i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n quiet at the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what shoul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d you fear?

YORK:
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry[SEQ_SPLITTER] ghost:
My grandam told me he was murdered there.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
PRINCE EDWARD:
I fear no uncles dead.

GLOUCESTER[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Nor none that live, I hope.

PRINCE EDWARD:
An i[SEQ_SPLITTER]f they live, I hope I need not fear.
But come, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord; and with a heavy heart,
Thinking on them, go[SEQ_SPLITTER] I unto the Tower.

BUCKINGHAM:
Think you, my lord[SEQ_SPLITTER], this little prating York
Was not incensed by his[SEQ_SPLITTER] subtle mother
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iously?

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a[SEQ_SPLITTER] parlous boy;
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, cap[SEQ_SPLITTER]able
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BUCKINGHAM:
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Cat[SEQ_SPLITTER]esby.
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we i[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntend
As closely to conceal what we impart:
Thou k[SEQ_SPLITTER]now'st our reasons urged upon the way;
What think'[SEQ_SPLITTER]st thou? is it not an easy matter
To make William [SEQ_SPLITTER]Lord Hastings of our mind,
For the instalment of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his noble duke
In the seat royal of this famous is[SEQ_SPLITTER]le?

CATESBY:
He for his father's sake so loves th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e prince,
That he will not be won to aught against[SEQ_SPLITTER] him.

BUCKINGHAM:
What think'st thou, then, of St[SEQ_SPLITTER]anley? what will he?

CATESBY:
He will do all in a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll as Hastings doth.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, then, no m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore but this: go, gentle Catesby,
And, as it were [SEQ_SPLITTER]far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
How doth he stan[SEQ_SPLITTER]d affected to our purpose;
And summon him to-morro[SEQ_SPLITTER]w to the Tower,
To sit about the coronation.
If th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou dost find him tractable to us,
Encourage him, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd show him all our reasons:
If he be leaden, icy-[SEQ_SPLITTER]cold, unwilling,
Be thou so too; and so break off [SEQ_SPLITTER]your talk,
And give us notice of his inclination:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
Wherein th[SEQ_SPLITTER]yself shalt highly be employ'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Comme[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
His anci[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent knot of dangerous adversaries
To-morrow are le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t blood at Pomfret-castle;
And bid my friend, for [SEQ_SPLITTER]joy of this good news,
Give mistress Shore one gen[SEQ_SPLITTER]tle kiss the more.

BUCKINGHAM:
Good Catesby, go, [SEQ_SPLITTER]effect this business soundly.

CATESBY:
My good lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rds both, with all the heed I may.

GLOUCESTER:
Sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

CATE[SEQ_SPLITTER]SBY:
You shall, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
At Crosby Pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace, there shall you find us both.

BUCKINGHAM:
No[SEQ_SPLITTER]w, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
Lord [SEQ_SPLITTER]Hastings will not yield to our complots?

GLOUCEST[SEQ_SPLITTER]ER:
Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
The ear[SEQ_SPLITTER]ldom of Hereford, and the moveables
Whereof the ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng my brother stood possess'd.

BUCKINGHAM:
I'll c[SEQ_SPLITTER]laim that promise at your grace's hands.

GLOUCEST[SEQ_SPLITTER]ER:
And look to have it yielded with all willingne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss.
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
We m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay digest our complots in some form.

Messenger:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat, ho! my lord!

HASTINGS:

Messenger:
A messeng[SEQ_SPLITTER]er from the Lord Stanley.

HASTINGS:
What is't o'c[SEQ_SPLITTER]lock?

Messenger:
Upon the stroke of four.

HASTIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]GS:
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Messenger:
So it should seem by that I have to sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
HASTINGS:
And then?

Messenger:
And then he sends[SEQ_SPLITTER] you word
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s helm:
Besides, he says there are two councils he[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld;
And that may be determined at the one
which ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y make you and him to rue at the other.
Therefore [SEQ_SPLITTER]he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
If pres[SEQ_SPLITTER]ently you will take horse with him,
And with all s[SEQ_SPLITTER]peed post with him toward the north,
To shun the d[SEQ_SPLITTER]anger that his soul divines.

HASTINGS:
Go, fellow[SEQ_SPLITTER], go, return unto thy lord;
Bid him not fear the s[SEQ_SPLITTER]eparated councils
His honour and myself are at the[SEQ_SPLITTER] one,
And at the other is my servant Catesby
Where[SEQ_SPLITTER] nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all not have intelligence.
Tell him his fears are [SEQ_SPLITTER]shallow, wanting instance:
And for his dreams, I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]onder he is so fond
To trust the mockery of unquie[SEQ_SPLITTER]t slumbers
To fly the boar before the boar pursues[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Were to incense the boar to follow us
And make p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ursuit where he did mean no chase.
Go, bid thy mas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter rise and come to me
And we will both together [SEQ_SPLITTER]to the Tower,
Where, he shall see, the boar will u[SEQ_SPLITTER]se us kindly.

Messenger:
My gracious lord, I'll t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell him what you say.

CATESBY:
Many good morrows [SEQ_SPLITTER]to my noble lord!

HASTINGS:
Good morrow, Catesby;[SEQ_SPLITTER] you are early stirring
What news, what news, in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his our tottering state?

CATESBY:
It is a reeling[SEQ_SPLITTER] world, indeed, my lord;
And I believe twill never[SEQ_SPLITTER] stand upright
Tim Richard wear the garland of the[SEQ_SPLITTER] realm.

HASTINGS:
How! wear the garland! dost tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u mean the crown?

CATESBY:
Ay, my good lord.

HAS[SEQ_SPLITTER]TINGS:
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]oulders
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced[SEQ_SPLITTER].
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?

CA[SEQ_SPLITTER]TESBY:
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
U[SEQ_SPLITTER]pon his party for the gain thereof:
And thereupon [SEQ_SPLITTER]he sends you this good news,
That this same very d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay your enemies,
The kindred of the queen, must di[SEQ_SPLITTER]e at Pomfret.

HASTINGS:
Indeed, I am no mourner f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or that news,
Because they have been still mine en[SEQ_SPLITTER]emies:
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ide,
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
God[SEQ_SPLITTER] knows I will not do it, to the death.

CATESBY:
G[SEQ_SPLITTER]od keep your lordship in that gracious mind!

HAST[SEQ_SPLITTER]INGS:
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce,
That they who brought me in my master's hate
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] live to look upon their tragedy.
I tell thee, Cat[SEQ_SPLITTER]esby--

CATESBY:
What, my lord?

HASTINGS:
Ere a f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ortnight make me elder,
I'll send some packing tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t yet think not on it.

CATESBY:
'Tis a vile thing[SEQ_SPLITTER] to die, my gracious lord,
When men are unprepared[SEQ_SPLITTER] and look not for it.

HASTINGS:
O monstrous, mons[SEQ_SPLITTER]trous! and so falls it out
With Rivers, Vaughan, G[SEQ_SPLITTER]rey: and so 'twill do
With some men else, who thin[SEQ_SPLITTER]k themselves as safe
As thou and I; who, as thou k[SEQ_SPLITTER]now'st, are dear
To princely Richard and to Buckin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gham.

CATESBY:
The princes both make high account[SEQ_SPLITTER] of you;
For they account his head upon the bridge[SEQ_SPLITTER].

HASTINGS:
I know they do; and I have well deser[SEQ_SPLITTER]ved it.
Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear[SEQ_SPLITTER], man?
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?

S[SEQ_SPLITTER]TANLEY:
My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
I do not[SEQ_SPLITTER] like these several councils, I.

HASTINGS:
My lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d,
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
And nev[SEQ_SPLITTER]er in my life, I do protest,
Was it more precious [SEQ_SPLITTER]to me than 'tis now:
Think you, but that I know ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r state secure,
I would be so triumphant as I am?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
STANLEY:
The lords at Pomfret, when they rode fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m London,
Were jocund, and supposed their state wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s sure,
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
This s[SEQ_SPLITTER]udden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
Pray God, I say,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I prove a needless coward!
What, shall we toward [SEQ_SPLITTER]the Tower? the day is spent.

HASTINGS:
Come, come[SEQ_SPLITTER], have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
To-day the[SEQ_SPLITTER] lords you talk of are beheaded.

LORD STANLEY:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey, for their truth, might better wear their heads[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Than some that have accused them wear their hats.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
But come, my lord, let us away.

HASTINGS:
Go on [SEQ_SPLITTER]before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
How now, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sirrah! how goes the world with thee?

Pursuivant:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The better that your lordship please to ask.

HAS[SEQ_SPLITTER]TINGS:
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]han when I met thee last where now we meet:
Then w[SEQ_SPLITTER]as I going prisoner to the Tower,
By the suggestio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n of the queen's allies;
But now, I tell thee--kee[SEQ_SPLITTER]p it to thyself--
This day those enemies are put t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o death,
And I in better state than e'er I was.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ursuivant:
God hold it, to your honour's good cont[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent!

HASTINGS:
Gramercy, fellow: there, drink tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t for me.

Pursuivant:
God save your lordship!

Pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iest:
Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your hon[SEQ_SPLITTER]our.

HASTINGS:
I thank thee, good Sir John, with [SEQ_SPLITTER]all my heart.
I am in your debt for your last exer[SEQ_SPLITTER]cise;
Come the next Sabbath, and I will content yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u.

BUCKINGHAM:
What, talking with a priest, lord [SEQ_SPLITTER]chamberlain?
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need[SEQ_SPLITTER] the priest;
Your honour hath no shriving work in [SEQ_SPLITTER]hand.

HASTINGS:
Good faith, and when I met this h[SEQ_SPLITTER]oly man,
Those men you talk of came into my mind.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]What, go you toward the Tower?

BUCKINGHAM:
I do, [SEQ_SPLITTER]my lord; but long I shall not stay
I shall return [SEQ_SPLITTER]before your lordship thence.

HASTINGS:
'Tis like [SEQ_SPLITTER]enough, for I stay dinner there.

BUCKINGHAM:

HAS[SEQ_SPLITTER]TINGS:
I'll wait upon your lordship.

RATCLIFF:
Co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me, bring forth the prisoners.

RIVERS:
Sir Richar[SEQ_SPLITTER]d Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
To-day shalt th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou behold a subject die
For truth, for duty, and f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or loyalty.

GREY:
God keep the prince from all th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e pack of you!
A knot you are of damned blood-suck[SEQ_SPLITTER]ers!

VAUGHAN:
You live that shall cry woe for thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s after.

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch; the limit of your li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ves is out.

RIVERS:
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bl[SEQ_SPLITTER]oody prison,
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
Wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hin the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the se[SEQ_SPLITTER]cond here was hack'd to death;
And, for more sland[SEQ_SPLITTER]er to thy dismal seat,
We give thee up our guiltle[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss blood to drink.

GREY:
Now Margaret's curse is [SEQ_SPLITTER]fall'n upon our heads,
For standing by when Richar[SEQ_SPLITTER]d stabb'd her son.

RIVERS:
Then cursed she Hastin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gs, then cursed she Buckingham,
Then cursed she Ri[SEQ_SPLITTER]chard. O, remember, God
To hear her prayers for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]em, as now for us
And for my sister and her prince[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly sons,
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blo[SEQ_SPLITTER]od,
Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt[SEQ_SPLITTER].

RATCLIFF:
Make haste; the hour of death is expi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate.

RIVERS:
Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l embrace:
And take our leave, until we meet in he[SEQ_SPLITTER]aven.

HASTINGS:
My lords, at once: the cause why [SEQ_SPLITTER]we are met
Is, to determine of the coronation.
In [SEQ_SPLITTER]God's name, speak: when is the royal day?

BUCKING[SEQ_SPLITTER]HAM:
Are all things fitting for that royal time?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]DERBY:
It is, and wants but nomination.

BISHOP OF[SEQ_SPLITTER] ELY:
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.

BUCKI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NGHAM:
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Who is most inward with the royal duke?

BISHOP O[SEQ_SPLITTER]F ELY:
Your grace, we think, should soonest know h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is mind.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who, I, my lord I we know ea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch other's faces,
But for our hearts, he knows no [SEQ_SPLITTER]more of mine,
Than I of yours;
Nor I no more of hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, than you of mine.
Lord Hastings, you and he are[SEQ_SPLITTER] near in love.

HASTINGS:
I thank his grace, I kno[SEQ_SPLITTER]w he loves me well;
But, for his purpose in the co[SEQ_SPLITTER]ronation.
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd[SEQ_SPLITTER]
His gracious pleasure any way therein:
But you, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y noble lords, may name the time;
And in the duke'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s behalf I'll give my voice,
Which, I presume, he'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll take in gentle part.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Now in goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d time, here comes the duke himself.

GLOUCESTER:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
I hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence dot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h neglect no great designs,
Which by my presence m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight have been concluded.

BUCKINGHAM:
Had not you[SEQ_SPLITTER] come upon your cue, my lord
William Lord Hastings[SEQ_SPLITTER] had pronounced your part,--
I mean, your voice,--[SEQ_SPLITTER]for crowning of the king.

GLOUCESTER:
Than my Lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d Hastings no man might be bolder;
His lordship kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ows me well, and loves me well.

HASTINGS:
I thank[SEQ_SPLITTER] your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord of Ely!

BISHOP [SEQ_SPLITTER]OF ELY:
My lord?

GLOUCESTER:
When I was last in H[SEQ_SPLITTER]olborn,
I saw good strawberries in your garden the[SEQ_SPLITTER]re
I do beseech you send for some of them.

BISHOP[SEQ_SPLITTER] OF ELY:
Marry, and will, my lord, with all my hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt.

GLOUCESTER:
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with[SEQ_SPLITTER] you.
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our busines[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
As he wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l lose his head ere give consent
His master's son,[SEQ_SPLITTER] as worshipful as he terms it,
Shall lose the roya[SEQ_SPLITTER]lty of England's throne.

BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw you[SEQ_SPLITTER] hence, my lord, I'll follow you.

DERBY:
We have [SEQ_SPLITTER]not yet set down this day of triumph.
To-morrow, i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n mine opinion, is too sudden;
For I myself am not[SEQ_SPLITTER] so well provided
As else I would be, were the day[SEQ_SPLITTER] prolong'd.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my lord prote[SEQ_SPLITTER]ctor? I have sent for these
strawberries.

HASTING[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]here's some conceit or other likes him well,
When [SEQ_SPLITTER]he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
I thin[SEQ_SPLITTER]k there's never a man in Christendom
That can less[SEQ_SPLITTER] hide his love or hate than he;
For by his face st[SEQ_SPLITTER]raight shall you know his heart.

DERBY:
What of h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is heart perceive you in his face
By any likelihoo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d he show'd to-day?

HASTINGS:
Marry, that with no[SEQ_SPLITTER] man here he is offended;
For, were he, he had sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn it in his looks.

DERBY:
I pray God he be not, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I say.

GLOUCESTER:
I pray you all, tell me what t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hey deserve
That do conspire my death with devilis[SEQ_SPLITTER]h plots
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevai[SEQ_SPLITTER]l'd
Upon my body with their hellish charms?

HASTI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NGS:
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]akes me most forward in this noble presence
To doo[SEQ_SPLITTER]m the offenders, whatsoever they be
I say, my lord[SEQ_SPLITTER], they have deserved death.

GLOUCESTER:
Then be y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our eyes the witness of this ill:
See how I am bew[SEQ_SPLITTER]itch'd; behold mine arm
Is, like a blasted sapling[SEQ_SPLITTER], wither'd up:
And this is Edward's wife, that mon[SEQ_SPLITTER]strous witch,
Consorted with that harlot strumpet [SEQ_SPLITTER]Shore,
That by their witchcraft thus have marked m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

HASTINGS:
If they have done this thing, my gra[SEQ_SPLITTER]cious lord--

GLOUCESTER:
If I thou protector of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his damned strumpet--
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou art a traitor:
Off with his head! Now, by Sain[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Paul I swear,
I will not dine until I see the sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]me.
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]rest, that love me, rise and follow me.

HASTINGS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
For I, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]oo fond, might have prevented this.
Stanley did dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eam the boar did raze his helm;
But I disdain'd it[SEQ_SPLITTER], and did scorn to fly:
Three times to-day my foot[SEQ_SPLITTER]-cloth horse did stumble,
And startled, when he lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ok'd upon the Tower,
As loath to bear me to the sl[SEQ_SPLITTER]aughter-house.
O, now I want the priest that spake[SEQ_SPLITTER] to me:
I now repent I told the pursuivant
As 'twe[SEQ_SPLITTER]re triumphing at mine enemies,
How they at Pomfret[SEQ_SPLITTER] bloodily were butcher'd,
And I myself secure in g[SEQ_SPLITTER]race and favour.
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]vy curse
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]d!

RATCLIFF:
Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be[SEQ_SPLITTER] at dinner:
Make a short shrift; he longs to see y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our head.

HASTINGS:
O momentary grace of mortal m[SEQ_SPLITTER]en,
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
Li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ves like a drunken sailor on a mast,
Ready, with e[SEQ_SPLITTER]very nod, to tumble down
Into the fatal bowels of [SEQ_SPLITTER]the deep.

LOVEL:
Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess to exclaim.

HASTINGS:
O bloody Richard! miser[SEQ_SPLITTER]able England!
I prophesy the fearful'st time to th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
Come, [SEQ_SPLITTER]lead me to the block; bear him my head.
They smile[SEQ_SPLITTER] at me that shortly shall be dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r,
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]then begin again, and stop again,
As if thou wert [SEQ_SPLITTER]distraught and mad with terror?

BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
Speak and lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ok back, and pry on every side,
Tremble and start [SEQ_SPLITTER]at wagging of a straw,
Intending deep suspicion: g[SEQ_SPLITTER]hastly looks
Are at my service, like enforced smil[SEQ_SPLITTER]es;
And both are ready in their offices,
At any ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]me, to grace my stratagems.
But what, is Catesby g[SEQ_SPLITTER]one?

GLOUCESTER:
He is; and, see, he brings the m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ayor along.

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--

GLOUCESTER[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Look to the drawbridge there!

BUCKINGHAM:
Hark![SEQ_SPLITTER] a drum.

GLOUCESTER:
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor, the reason we have sent-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-

GLOUCESTER:
Look back, defend thee, here are en[SEQ_SPLITTER]emies.

BUCKINGHAM:
God and our innocency defend a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd guard us!

GLOUCESTER:
Be patient, they are fri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ends, Ratcliff and Lovel.

LOVEL:
Here is the head[SEQ_SPLITTER] of that ignoble traitor,
The dangerous and unsusp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ected Hastings.

GLOUCESTER:
So dear I loved the m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an, that I must weep.
I took him for the plainest [SEQ_SPLITTER]harmless creature
That breathed upon this earth a [SEQ_SPLITTER]Christian;
Made him my book wherein my soul record[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed
The history of all her secret thoughts:
So smoo[SEQ_SPLITTER]th he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
That, h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is apparent open guilt omitted,
I mean, his conver[SEQ_SPLITTER]sation with Shore's wife,
He lived from all attain[SEQ_SPLITTER]der of suspect.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, well, he was th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e covert'st shelter'd traitor
That ever lived.
Wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld you imagine, or almost believe,
Were't not that[SEQ_SPLITTER], by great preservation,
We live to tell it you, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he subtle traitor
This day had plotted, in the cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ncil-house
To murder me and my good Lord of Glouce[SEQ_SPLITTER]ster?

Lord Mayor:
What, had he so?

GLOUCESTER:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat, think You we are Turks or infidels?
Or that w[SEQ_SPLITTER]e would, against the form of law,
Proceed thus ras[SEQ_SPLITTER]hly to the villain's death,
But that the extreme p[SEQ_SPLITTER]eril of the case,
The peace of England and our per[SEQ_SPLITTER]sons' safety,
Enforced us to this execution?

Lord[SEQ_SPLITTER] Mayor:
Now, fair befall you! he deserved his deat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h;
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded[SEQ_SPLITTER],
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] never look'd for better at his hands,
After he on[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce fell in with Mistress Shore.

GLOUCESTER:
Yet h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad not we determined he should die,
Until your lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]dship came to see his death;
Which now the loving [SEQ_SPLITTER]haste of these our friends,
Somewhat against our m[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaning, have prevented:
Because, my lord, we would[SEQ_SPLITTER] have had you heard
The traitor speak, and timorou[SEQ_SPLITTER]sly confess
The manner and the purpose of his trea[SEQ_SPLITTER]son;
That you might well have signified the same
U[SEQ_SPLITTER]nto the citizens, who haply may
Misconstrue us in [SEQ_SPLITTER]him and wail his death.

Lord Mayor:
But, my good [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord, your grace's word shall serve,
As well as I [SEQ_SPLITTER]had seen and heard him speak
And doubt you not, ri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght noble princes both,
But I'll acquaint our dute[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous citizens
With all your just proceedings in thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s cause.

GLOUCESTER:
And to that end we wish'd yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur lord-ship here,
To avoid the carping censures o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f the world.

BUCKINGHAM:
But since you come too l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate of our intents,
Yet witness what you hear we d[SEQ_SPLITTER]id intend:
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid fare[SEQ_SPLITTER]well.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, after, after, cousin Buckin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gham.
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all [SEQ_SPLITTER]post:
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
Tell th[SEQ_SPLITTER]em how Edward put to death a citizen,
Only for say[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing he would make his son
Heir to the crown; meani[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng indeed his house,
Which, by the sign thereof wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s termed so.
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] bestial appetite in change of lust;
Which stretch[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed to their servants, daughters, wives,
Even where[SEQ_SPLITTER] his lustful eye or savage heart,
Without control,[SEQ_SPLITTER] listed to make his prey.
Nay, for a need, thus fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]r come near my person:
Tell them, when that my mot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her went with child
Of that unsatiate Edward, nobl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e York
My princely father then had wars in France
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And, by just computation of the time,
Found that t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he issue was not his begot;
Which well appeared in[SEQ_SPLITTER] his lineaments,
Being nothing like the noble duke[SEQ_SPLITTER] my father:
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]r off,
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

BUCKINGHAM:
Fear not, my lord, I'll play the ora[SEQ_SPLITTER]tor
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Were fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r myself: and so, my lord, adieu.

GLOUCESTER:
If [SEQ_SPLITTER]you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]here you shall find me well accompanied
With rever[SEQ_SPLITTER]end fathers and well-learned bishops.

BUCKINGHAM:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I go: and towards three or four o'clock
Look for [SEQ_SPLITTER]the news that the Guildhall affords.

GLOUCESTER:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
Go thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]to Friar Penker; bid them both
Meet me within this[SEQ_SPLITTER] hour at Baynard's Castle.
Now will I in, to take [SEQ_SPLITTER]some privy order,
To draw the brats of Clarence ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of sight;
And to give notice, that no manner of [SEQ_SPLITTER]person
At any time have recourse unto the princes.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Scrivener:
This is the indictment of the good Lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd Hastings;
Which in a set hand fairly is engross[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d,
That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd mark how well the sequel hangs together:
Eleven[SEQ_SPLITTER] hours I spent to write it over,
For yesternight b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y Catesby was it brought me;
The precedent was ful[SEQ_SPLITTER]l as long a-doing:
And yet within these five hours[SEQ_SPLITTER] lived Lord Hastings,
Untainted, unexamined, free,[SEQ_SPLITTER] at liberty
Here's a good world the while! Why who[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s so gross,
That seeth not this palpable device?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
Bad i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the world; and all will come to nought,
When suc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h bad dealings must be seen in thought.

GLOUCESTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]R:
How now, my lord, what say the citizens?

BUCKI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NGHAM:
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
The ci[SEQ_SPLITTER]tizens are mum and speak not a word.

GLOUCESTER:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?

BU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CKINGHAM:
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And his contract by deputy in France;
The insatia[SEQ_SPLITTER]te greediness of his desires,
And his enforcement [SEQ_SPLITTER]of the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his ow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n bastardy,
As being got, your father then in Fran[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce,
His resemblance, being not like the duke;
With[SEQ_SPLITTER]al I did infer your lineaments,
Being the right id[SEQ_SPLITTER]ea of your father,
Both in your form and nobleness[SEQ_SPLITTER] of mind;
Laid open all your victories in Scotland[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your bou[SEQ_SPLITTER]nty, virtue, fair humility:
Indeed, left nothing f[SEQ_SPLITTER]itting for the purpose
Untouch'd, or slightly hand[SEQ_SPLITTER]led, in discourse
And when mine oratory grew to an[SEQ_SPLITTER] end
I bid them that did love their country's good[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'

GL[SEQ_SPLITTER]OUCESTER:
Ah! and did they so?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, so[SEQ_SPLITTER] God help me, they spake not a word;
But, like dum[SEQ_SPLITTER]b statues or breathing stones,
Gazed each on other[SEQ_SPLITTER], and look'd deadly pale.
Which when I saw, I repr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ehended them;
And ask'd the mayor what meant this [SEQ_SPLITTER]wilful silence:
His answer was, the people were no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t wont
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
Then he[SEQ_SPLITTER] was urged to tell my tale again,
'Thus saith the [SEQ_SPLITTER]duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
But nothing sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake in warrant from himself.
When he had done, som[SEQ_SPLITTER]e followers of mine own,
At the lower end of the h[SEQ_SPLITTER]all, hurl'd up their caps,
And some ten voices cri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed 'God save King Richard!'
And thus I took the va[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntage of those few,
'Thanks, gentle citizens and f[SEQ_SPLITTER]riends,' quoth I;
'This general applause and lovin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g shout
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd:'
And even here brake off, and came away.

GLOU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CESTER:
What tongueless blocks were they! would no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t they speak?

BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my troth, my lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.

GLOUCESTER:
Will not the mayor then and his br[SEQ_SPLITTER]ethren come?

BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor is here at han[SEQ_SPLITTER]d: intend some fear;
Be not you spoke with, but by[SEQ_SPLITTER] mighty suit:
And look you get a prayer-book in yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur hand,
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord;
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
And be not easily won to our request:
Play the m[SEQ_SPLITTER]aid's part, still answer nay, and take it.

GLOUCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]STER:
I go; and if you plead as well for them
As I[SEQ_SPLITTER] can say nay to thee for myself,
No doubt well bri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng it to a happy issue.

BUCKINGHAM:
Go, go, up to[SEQ_SPLITTER] the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
Welcome my lord[SEQ_SPLITTER]; I dance attendance here;
I think the duke will n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot be spoke withal.
Here comes his servant: how no[SEQ_SPLITTER]w, Catesby,
What says he?

CATESBY:
My lord: he do[SEQ_SPLITTER]th entreat your grace;
To visit him to-morrow or n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ext day:
He is within, with two right reverend fat[SEQ_SPLITTER]hers,
Divinely bent to meditation;
And no worldly [SEQ_SPLITTER]suit would he be moved,
To draw him from his holy [SEQ_SPLITTER]exercise.

BUCKINGHAM:
Return, good Catesby, to th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y lord again;
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citi[SEQ_SPLITTER]zens,
In deep designs and matters of great moment,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
No less importing than our general good,
Are come[SEQ_SPLITTER] to have some conference with his grace.

CATESBY:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I'll tell him what you say, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
He[SEQ_SPLITTER] is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
But on his knee[SEQ_SPLITTER]s at meditation;
Not dallying with a brace of cour[SEQ_SPLITTER]tezans,
But meditating with two deep divines;
Not [SEQ_SPLITTER]sleeping, to engross his idle body,
But praying, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o enrich his watchful soul:
Happy were England, wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld this gracious prince
Take on himself the sover[SEQ_SPLITTER]eignty thereof:
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er [SEQ_SPLITTER]win him to it.

Lord Mayor:
Marry, God forbid his [SEQ_SPLITTER]grace should say us nay!

BUCKINGHAM:
I fear he wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll.
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?

CATESB[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y:
My lord,
He wonders to what end you have assemb[SEQ_SPLITTER]led
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
His[SEQ_SPLITTER] grace not being warn'd thereof before:
My lord, h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e fears you mean no good to him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Sorr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me, that I m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ean no good to him:
By heaven, I come in perfect l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove to him;
And so once more return and tell his g[SEQ_SPLITTER]race.
When holy and devout religious men
Are at th[SEQ_SPLITTER]eir beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
So sweet[SEQ_SPLITTER] is zealous contemplation.

Lord Mayor:
See, where[SEQ_SPLITTER] he stands between two clergymen!

BUCKINGHAM:
Two[SEQ_SPLITTER] props of virtue for a Christian prince,
To stay h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im from the fall of vanity:
And, see, a book of pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ayer in his hand,
True ornaments to know a holy ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
Lend [SEQ_SPLITTER]favourable ears to our request;
And pardon us the [SEQ_SPLITTER]interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian z[SEQ_SPLITTER]eal.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, there needs no such apo[SEQ_SPLITTER]logy:
I rather do beseech you pardon me,
Who, earn[SEQ_SPLITTER]est in the service of my God,
Neglect the visitati[SEQ_SPLITTER]on of my friends.
But, leaving this, what is your [SEQ_SPLITTER]grace's pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
Even that, I hope, [SEQ_SPLITTER]which pleaseth God above,
And all good men of this[SEQ_SPLITTER] ungovern'd isle.

GLOUCESTER:
I do suspect I have[SEQ_SPLITTER] done some offence
That seems disgracious in the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ity's eyes,
And that you come to reprehend my igno[SEQ_SPLITTER]rance.

BUCKINGHAM:
You have, my lord: would it mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght please your grace,
At our entreaties, to amend[SEQ_SPLITTER] that fault!

GLOUCESTER:
Else wherefore breathe I[SEQ_SPLITTER] in a Christian land?

BUCKINGHAM:
Then know, it i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s your fault that you resign
The supreme seat, the[SEQ_SPLITTER] throne majestical,
The scepter'd office of your a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ncestors,
Your state of fortune and your due of bi[SEQ_SPLITTER]rth,
The lineal glory of your royal house,
To the [SEQ_SPLITTER]corruption of a blemished stock:
Whilst, in the mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ldness of your sleepy thoughts,
Which here we wake[SEQ_SPLITTER]n to our country's good,
This noble isle doth want[SEQ_SPLITTER] her proper limbs;
Her face defaced with scars of [SEQ_SPLITTER]infamy,
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
Of b[SEQ_SPLITTER]lind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
Which to rec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ure, we heartily solicit
Your gracious self to tak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e on you the charge
And kingly government of this [SEQ_SPLITTER]your land,
Not as protector, steward, substitute,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Or lowly factor for another's gain;
But as success[SEQ_SPLITTER]ively from blood to blood,
Your right of birth, yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur empery, your own.
For this, consorted with the [SEQ_SPLITTER]citizens,
Your very worshipful and loving friends,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And by their vehement instigation,
In this just s[SEQ_SPLITTER]uit come I to move your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
I know[SEQ_SPLITTER] not whether to depart in silence,
Or bitterly to [SEQ_SPLITTER]speak in your reproof.
Best fitteth my degree or y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our condition
If not to answer, you might haply th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ink
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
To[SEQ_SPLITTER] bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
Which fondly[SEQ_SPLITTER] you would here impose on me;
If to reprove you fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r this suit of yours,
So season'd with your faithf[SEQ_SPLITTER]ul love to me.
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] my friends.
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the[SEQ_SPLITTER] first,
And then, in speaking, not to incur the la[SEQ_SPLITTER]st,
Definitively thus I answer you.
Your love dese[SEQ_SPLITTER]rves my thanks; but my desert
Unmeritable shuns yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur high request.
First if all obstacles were cut a[SEQ_SPLITTER]way,
And that my path were even to the crown,
As m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y ripe revenue and due by birth
Yet so much is my [SEQ_SPLITTER]poverty of spirit,
So mighty and so many my defect[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
Bein[SEQ_SPLITTER]g a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Than in my greatn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess covet to be hid,
And in the vapour of my glory[SEQ_SPLITTER] smother'd.
But, God be thank'd, there's no need o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f me,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
Which, mel[SEQ_SPLITTER]low'd by the stealing hours of time,
Will well bec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome the seat of majesty,
And make, no doubt, us ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ppy by his reign.
On him I lay what you would lay [SEQ_SPLITTER]on me,
The right and fortune of his happy stars;
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hich God defend that I should wring from him!

BUC[SEQ_SPLITTER]KINGHAM:
My lord, this argues conscience in your g[SEQ_SPLITTER]race;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivia[SEQ_SPLITTER]l,
All circumstances well considered.
You say that[SEQ_SPLITTER] Edward is your brother's son:
So say we too, but [SEQ_SPLITTER]not by Edward's wife;
For first he was contract to[SEQ_SPLITTER] Lady Lucy--
Your mother lives a witness to that v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow--
And afterward by substitute betroth'd
To Bona[SEQ_SPLITTER], sister to the King of France.
These both put by [SEQ_SPLITTER]a poor petitioner,
A care-crazed mother of a many [SEQ_SPLITTER]children,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
Ev[SEQ_SPLITTER]en in the afternoon of her best days,
Made prize a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd purchase of his lustful eye,
Seduced the pitch [SEQ_SPLITTER]and height of all his thoughts
To base declension [SEQ_SPLITTER]and loathed bigamy
By her, in his unlawful bed, he[SEQ_SPLITTER] got
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince[SEQ_SPLITTER].
More bitterly could I expostulate,
Save that, fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r reverence to some alive,
I give a sparing limit [SEQ_SPLITTER]to my tongue.
Then, good my lord, take to your roy[SEQ_SPLITTER]al self
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
If non [SEQ_SPLITTER]to bless us and the land withal,
Yet to draw forth[SEQ_SPLITTER] your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g times,
Unto a lineal true-derived course.

Lord [SEQ_SPLITTER]Mayor:
Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you[SEQ_SPLITTER].

BUCKINGHAM:
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proff[SEQ_SPLITTER]er'd love.

CATESBY:
O, make them joyful, grant th[SEQ_SPLITTER]eir lawful suit!

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, why would you [SEQ_SPLITTER]heap these cares on me?
I am unfit for state and m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ajesty;
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
I can[SEQ_SPLITTER]not nor I will not yield to you.

BUCKINGHAM:
If y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
Loath to depo[SEQ_SPLITTER]se the child, Your brother's son;
As well we know [SEQ_SPLITTER]your tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind, effemin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate remorse,
Which we have noted in you to your ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]n,
And egally indeed to all estates,--
Yet whether[SEQ_SPLITTER] you accept our suit or no,
Your brother's son sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll never reign our king;
But we will plant some ot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her in the throne,
To the disgrace and downfall of[SEQ_SPLITTER] your house:
And in this resolution here we leave [SEQ_SPLITTER]you.--
Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re.

GLOUCESTER:
O, do not swear, my lord of Bucki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngham.

CATESBY:
Call them again, my lord, and acc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ept their suit.

ANOTHER:
Do, good my lord, lest a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll the land do rue it.

GLOUCESTER:
Would you enfo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rce me to a world of care?
Well, call them again. [SEQ_SPLITTER]I am not made of stone,
But penetrable to your. ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd entreats,
Albeit against my conscience and my s[SEQ_SPLITTER]oul.
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
To bea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r her burthen, whether I will or no,
I must have p[SEQ_SPLITTER]atience to endure the load:
But if black scandal o[SEQ_SPLITTER]r foul-faced reproach
Attend the sequel of your im[SEQ_SPLITTER]position,
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance [SEQ_SPLITTER]me
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or God he knows, and you may partly see,
How far I[SEQ_SPLITTER] am from the desire thereof.

Lord Mayor:
God bles[SEQ_SPLITTER]s your grace! we see it, and will say it.

GLOUCES[SEQ_SPLITTER]TER:
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.

B[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCKINGHAM:
Then I salute you with this kingly titl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e:
Long live Richard, England's royal king!

Lord [SEQ_SPLITTER]Mayor:
Amen.

BUCKINGHAM:
To-morrow will it please[SEQ_SPLITTER] you to be crown'd?

GLOUCESTER:
Even when you ple[SEQ_SPLITTER]ase, since you will have it so.

BUCKINGHAM:
To-mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrow, then, we will attend your grace:
And so most[SEQ_SPLITTER] joyfully we take our leave.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t us to our holy task again.
Farewell, good cousin[SEQ_SPLITTER]; farewell, gentle friends.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Who [SEQ_SPLITTER]meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
Led in the ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my lif[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, she's wandering to the Tower,
On pure heart's l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove to greet the tender princes.
Daughter, well me[SEQ_SPLITTER]t.

LADY ANNE:
God give your graces both
A happy a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd a joyful time of day!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As much[SEQ_SPLITTER] to you, good sister! Whither away?

LADY ANNE:
No[SEQ_SPLITTER] farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
Upon the[SEQ_SPLITTER] like devotion as yourselves,
To gratulate the gen[SEQ_SPLITTER]tle princes there.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Kind sister, [SEQ_SPLITTER]thanks: we'll enter all together.
And, in good tim[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, here the lieutenant comes.
Master lieutenant, p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ray you, by your leave,
How doth the prince, and m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y young son of York?

BRAKENBURY:
Right well, dear[SEQ_SPLITTER] madam. By your patience,
I may not suffer you to [SEQ_SPLITTER]visit them;
The king hath straitly charged the con[SEQ_SPLITTER]trary.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The king! why, who's that[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

BRAKENBURY:
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]otector.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The Lord protect him fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds betwixt t[SEQ_SPLITTER]heir love and me?
I am their mother; who should ke[SEQ_SPLITTER]ep me from them?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am their fath[SEQ_SPLITTER]ers mother; I will see them.

LADY ANNE:
Their aun[SEQ_SPLITTER]t I am in law, in love their mother:
Then bring me[SEQ_SPLITTER] to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
And take thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] office from thee, on my peril.

BRAKENBURY:
No, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]adam, no; I may not leave it so:
I am bound by oat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h, and therefore pardon me.

LORD STANLEY:
Let me [SEQ_SPLITTER]but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
And I'll sal[SEQ_SPLITTER]ute your grace of York as mother,
And reverend loo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ker on, of two fair queens.
Come, madam, you must [SEQ_SPLITTER]straight to Westminster,
There to be crowned Richa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd's royal queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, cut my lace[SEQ_SPLITTER] in sunder, that my pent heart
May have some scope[SEQ_SPLITTER] to beat, or else I swoon
With this dead-killing n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ews!

LADY ANNE:
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing [SEQ_SPLITTER]news!

DORSET:
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares[SEQ_SPLITTER] your grace?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O Dorset, speak not[SEQ_SPLITTER] to me, get thee hence!
Death and destruction dog [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee at the heels;
Thy mother's name is ominous to[SEQ_SPLITTER] children.
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he seas,
And live with Richmond, from the reach of[SEQ_SPLITTER] hell
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ouse,
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
Nor[SEQ_SPLITTER] mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

LORD [SEQ_SPLITTER]STANLEY:
Full of wise care is this your counsel, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]adam.
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou shall have letters from me to my son
To meet yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u on the way, and welcome you.
Be not ta'en tardy [SEQ_SPLITTER]by unwise delay.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O ill-dispersin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g wind of misery!
O my accursed womb, the bed of d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eath!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

LORD STANLEY:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.

LADY [SEQ_SPLITTER]ANNE:
And I in all unwillingness will go.
I would [SEQ_SPLITTER]to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden metal th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at must round my brow
Were red-hot steel, to sear [SEQ_SPLITTER]me to the brain!
Anointed let me be with deadly ve[SEQ_SPLITTER]nom,
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen![SEQ_SPLITTER]

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Go, go, poor soul, I envy not t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy glory
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
LADY ANNE:
No! why?  When he that is my husband n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
When s[SEQ_SPLITTER]carce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
Whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch issued from my other angel husband
And that dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]d saint which then I weeping follow'd;
O, when, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]say, I look'd on Richard's face,
This was my wish:[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
For making me, so[SEQ_SPLITTER] young, so old a widow!
And, when thou wed'st, let[SEQ_SPLITTER] sorrow haunt thy bed;
And be thy wife--if any be [SEQ_SPLITTER]so mad--
As miserable by the life of thee
As thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]hast made me by my dear lord's death!
Lo, ere I ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]n repeat this curse again,
Even in so short a spac[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, my woman's heart
Grossly grew captive to his ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ney words
And proved the subject of my own soul's [SEQ_SPLITTER]curse,
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from res[SEQ_SPLITTER]t;
For never yet one hour in his bed
Have I enjoy'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d the golden dew of sleep,
But have been waked by [SEQ_SPLITTER]his timorous dreams.
Besides, he hates me for my f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather Warwick;
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid [SEQ_SPLITTER]of me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Poor heart, adieu! I pity[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy complaining.

LADY ANNE:
No more than from my[SEQ_SPLITTER] soul I mourn for yours.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Farewel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, thou woful welcomer of glory!

LADY ANNE:
Adieu[SEQ_SPLITTER], poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!

DUCHESS[SEQ_SPLITTER] OF YORK:

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Stay, yet look back wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th me unto the Tower.
Pity, you ancient stones, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ose tender babes
Whom envy hath immured within you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r walls!
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones![SEQ_SPLITTER]
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
For tend[SEQ_SPLITTER]er princes, use my babies well!
So foolish sorrow [SEQ_SPLITTER]bids your stones farewell.

KING RICHARD III:
Stan[SEQ_SPLITTER]d all apart Cousin of Buckingham!

BUCKINGHAM:
My [SEQ_SPLITTER]gracious sovereign?

KING RICHARD III:
Give me thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] hand.
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy assistance[SEQ_SPLITTER], is King Richard seated;
But shall we wear these [SEQ_SPLITTER]honours for a day?
Or shall they last, and we rejo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice in them?

BUCKINGHAM:
Still live they and for [SEQ_SPLITTER]ever may they last!

KING RICHARD III:
O Buckingha[SEQ_SPLITTER]m, now do I play the touch,
To try if thou be curr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent gold indeed
Young Edward lives: think now what[SEQ_SPLITTER] I would say.

BUCKINGHAM:
Say on, my loving lord.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KING RICHARD III:
Why, Buckingham, I say, I woul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d be king,

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, so you are, my thrice[SEQ_SPLITTER] renowned liege.

KING RICHARD III:
Ha! am I king?[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'tis so: but Edward lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
True, nob[SEQ_SPLITTER]le prince.

KING RICHARD III:
O bitter consequence[SEQ_SPLITTER],
That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce!'
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
Sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
And I wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld have it suddenly perform'd.
What sayest thou? s[SEQ_SPLITTER]peak suddenly; be brief.

BUCKINGHAM:
Your grace m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay do your pleasure.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut, [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
Say, have[SEQ_SPLITTER] I thy consent that they shall die?

BUCKINGHAM:
G[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive me some breath, some little pause, my lord
Bef[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore I positively herein:
I will resolve your grace[SEQ_SPLITTER] immediately.

CATESBY:

KING RICHARD III:
I will [SEQ_SPLITTER]converse with iron-witted fools
And unrespective b[SEQ_SPLITTER]oys: none are for me
That look into me with consid[SEQ_SPLITTER]erate eyes:
High-reaching Buckingham grows circums[SEQ_SPLITTER]pect.
Boy!

Page:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Know[SEQ_SPLITTER]'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
Would tempt [SEQ_SPLITTER]unto a close exploit of death?

Page:
My lord, I k[SEQ_SPLITTER]now a discontented gentleman,
Whose humble means m[SEQ_SPLITTER]atch not his haughty mind:
Gold were as good as tw[SEQ_SPLITTER]enty orators,
And will, no doubt, tempt him to any[SEQ_SPLITTER] thing.

KING RICHARD III:
What is his name?

Page[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.

KING RICHARD III:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
The d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eep-revolving witty Buckingham
No more shall be th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e neighbour to my counsel:
Hath he so long held ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t with me untired,
And stops he now for breath?
Ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w now! what news with you?

STANLEY:
My lord, I he[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar the Marquis Dorset's fled
To Richmond, in those[SEQ_SPLITTER] parts beyond the sea
Where he abides.

KING RICHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD III:
Catesby!

CATESBY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD [SEQ_SPLITTER]III:
Rumour it abroad
That Anne, my wife, is sick [SEQ_SPLITTER]and like to die:
I will take order for her keeping[SEQ_SPLITTER] close.
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look, how t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou dream'st! I say again, give out
That Anne my w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ife is sick and like to die:
About it; for it stan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds me much upon,
To stop all hopes whose growth ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y damage me.
I must be married to my brother's dau[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghter,
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
Uncertai[SEQ_SPLITTER]n way of gain! But I am in
So far in blood that si[SEQ_SPLITTER]n will pluck on sin:
Tear-falling pity dwells not [SEQ_SPLITTER]in this eye.
Is thy name Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
James Ty[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrel, and your most obedient subject.

KING RICHAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]D III:
Art thou, indeed?

TYRREL:
Prove me, my gra[SEQ_SPLITTER]cious sovereign.

KING RICHARD III:
Darest thou re[SEQ_SPLITTER]solve to kill a friend of mine?

TYRREL:
Ay, my lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd;
But I had rather kill two enemies.

KING RICHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD III:
Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]re they that I would have thee deal upon:
Tyrrel, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I mean those bastards in the Tower.

TYRREL:
Let m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e have open means to come to them,
And soon I'll r[SEQ_SPLITTER]id you from the fear of them.

KING RICHARD III:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
Ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e is no more but so: say it is done,
And I will lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve thee, and prefer thee too.

TYRREL:
'Tis done, [SEQ_SPLITTER]my gracious lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Shall we hear[SEQ_SPLITTER] from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?

TYRREL:
Ye shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, my Lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord, I have consider'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d in my mind
The late demand that you did sound me[SEQ_SPLITTER] in.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let that pass. Dorse[SEQ_SPLITTER]t is fled to Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
I hear that ne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ws, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, he is you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r wife's son well, look to it.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
For which[SEQ_SPLITTER] your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
The earldom[SEQ_SPLITTER] of Hereford and the moveables
The which you promi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sed I should possess.

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, [SEQ_SPLITTER]look to your wife; if she convey
Letters to Richmo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, you shall answer it.

BUCKINGHAM:
What says yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur highness to my just demand?

KING RICHARD III:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]As I remember, Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ichmond should be king,
When Richmond was a little[SEQ_SPLITTER] peevish boy.
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--

BUCKING[SEQ_SPLITTER]HAM:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
How chance the pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ophet could not at that time
Have told me, I being[SEQ_SPLITTER] by, that I should kill him?

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord,[SEQ_SPLITTER] your promise for the earldom,--

KING RICHARD III[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
The mayor i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n courtesy show'd me the castle,
And call'd it Rou[SEQ_SPLITTER]gemont: at which name I started,
Because a bard of[SEQ_SPLITTER] Ireland told me once
I should not live long after[SEQ_SPLITTER] I saw Richmond.

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord!

KING RICHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD III:
Ay, what's o'clock?

BUCKINGHAM:
I am thus[SEQ_SPLITTER] bold to put your grace in mind
Of what you promis[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed me.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, but what's o'clock[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

BUCKINGHAM:
Upon the stroke of ten.

KING RICHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD III:
Well, let it strike.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why let [SEQ_SPLITTER]it strike?

KING RICHARD III:
Because that, like a[SEQ_SPLITTER] Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
Betwixt thy begging[SEQ_SPLITTER] and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein to[SEQ_SPLITTER]-day.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, then resolve me whether yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u will or no.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut,
Thou tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]oublest me; am not in the vein.

BUCKINGHAM:
Is it[SEQ_SPLITTER] even so? rewards he my true service
With such dee[SEQ_SPLITTER]p contempt made I him king for this?
O, let me thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nk on Hastings, and be gone
To Brecknock, while my[SEQ_SPLITTER] fearful head is on!

TYRREL:
The tyrannous and bl[SEQ_SPLITTER]oody deed is done.
The most arch of piteous massac[SEQ_SPLITTER]re
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Dighton [SEQ_SPLITTER]and Forrest, whom I did suborn
To do this ruthless[SEQ_SPLITTER] piece of butchery,
Although they were flesh'd vil[SEQ_SPLITTER]lains, bloody dogs,
Melting with tenderness and ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd compassion
Wept like two children in their deat[SEQ_SPLITTER]hs' sad stories.
'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ose tender babes:'
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'g[SEQ_SPLITTER]irdling one another
Within their innocent alabaste[SEQ_SPLITTER]r arms:
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
A[SEQ_SPLITTER] book of prayers on their pillow lay;
Which once,'[SEQ_SPLITTER] quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
But O! th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e devil'--there the villain stopp'd
Whilst Dighton[SEQ_SPLITTER] thus told on: 'We smothered
The most replenished [SEQ_SPLITTER]sweet work of nature,
That from the prime creation[SEQ_SPLITTER] e'er she framed.'
Thus both are gone with conscie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce and remorse;
They could not speak; and so I le[SEQ_SPLITTER]ft them both,
To bring this tidings to the bloody [SEQ_SPLITTER]king.
And here he comes.
All hail, my sovereign li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ege!

KING RICHARD III:
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy news?

TYRREL:
If to have done the thing you [SEQ_SPLITTER]gave in charge
Beget your happiness, be happy then[SEQ_SPLITTER],
For it is done, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]didst thou see them dead?

TYRREL:
I did, my lord.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KING RICHARD III:
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?

TY[SEQ_SPLITTER]RREL:
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]But how or in what place I do not know.

KING RICH[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARD III:
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]eantime, but think how I may do thee good,
And be [SEQ_SPLITTER]inheritor of thy desire.
Farewell till soon.
The s[SEQ_SPLITTER]on of Clarence have I pent up close;
His daughter [SEQ_SPLITTER]meanly have I match'd in marriage;
The sons of Edw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard sleep in Abraham's bosom,
And Anne my wife hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h bid the world good night.
Now, for I know the Br[SEQ_SPLITTER]eton Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth, my brother'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s daughter,
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er [SEQ_SPLITTER]the crown,
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ATESBY:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
Good news or b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad, that thou comest in so bluntly?

CATESBY:
Bad [SEQ_SPLITTER]news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
And Buckin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
Is in the fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]eld, and still his power increaseth.

KING RICHARD[SEQ_SPLITTER] III:
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Than[SEQ_SPLITTER] Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come, I have[SEQ_SPLITTER] heard that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor [SEQ_SPLITTER]to dull delay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-pace[SEQ_SPLITTER]d beggary
Then fiery expedition be my wing,
Jove's[SEQ_SPLITTER] Mercury, and herald for a king!
Come, muster men:[SEQ_SPLITTER] my counsel is my shield;
We must be brief when tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]aitors brave the field.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So, now p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the rotte[SEQ_SPLITTER]n mouth of death.
Here in these confines slily hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I lurk'd,
To watch the waning of mine adversarie[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.
A dire induction am I witness to,
And will to F[SEQ_SPLITTER]rance, hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter[SEQ_SPLITTER], black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee, wretched Mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]garet: who comes here?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, my yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ung princes! ah, my tender babes!
My unblown flowe[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs, new-appearing sweets!
If yet your gentle souls[SEQ_SPLITTER] fly in the air
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Hover about me with your airy wings
And hear you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r mother's lamentation!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hover abo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut her; say, that right for right
Hath dimm'd your[SEQ_SPLITTER] infant morn to aged night.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
So m[SEQ_SPLITTER]any miseries have crazed my voice,
That my woe-wea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ried tongue is mute and dumb,
Edward Plantagenet, [SEQ_SPLITTER]why art thou dead?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Plantagenet do[SEQ_SPLITTER]th quit Plantagenet.
Edward for Edward pays a dyin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g debt.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Wilt thou, O God, fly fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om such gentle lambs,
And throw them in the entrai[SEQ_SPLITTER]ls of the wolf?
When didst thou sleep when such a [SEQ_SPLITTER]deed was done?

QUEEN MARGARET:
When holy Harry di[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed, and my sweet son.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Blind sigh[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Woe's scen[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
Bri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ef abstract and record of tedious days,
Rest thy u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nrest on England's lawful earth,
Unlawfully made d[SEQ_SPLITTER]runk with innocents' blood!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat thou wouldst as well afford a grave
As thou ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]nst yield a melancholy seat!
Then would I hide my [SEQ_SPLITTER]bones, not rest them here.
O, who hath any cause t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o mourn but I?

QUEEN MARGARET:
If ancient sorrow [SEQ_SPLITTER]be most reverend,
Give mine the benefit of seniory[SEQ_SPLITTER],
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow can admit society,
Tell o'er your woes again by[SEQ_SPLITTER] viewing mine:
I had an Edward, till a Richard kil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l'd him;
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;

[SEQ_SPLITTER]DUCHESS OF YORK:
I had a Richard too, and thou did[SEQ_SPLITTER]st kill him;
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to [SEQ_SPLITTER]kill him.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hadst a Clarence t[SEQ_SPLITTER]oo, and Richard kill'd him.
From forth the kennel [SEQ_SPLITTER]of thy womb hath crept
A hell-hound that doth hunt[SEQ_SPLITTER] us all to death:
That dog, that had his teeth bef[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore his eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle [SEQ_SPLITTER]blood,
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
That reigns i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n galled eyes of weeping souls,
Thy womb let loose[SEQ_SPLITTER], to chase us to our graves.
O upright, just, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]true-disposing God,
How do I thank thee, that this[SEQ_SPLITTER] carnal cur
Preys on the issue of his mother's bod[SEQ_SPLITTER]y,
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!

DU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CHESS OF YORK:
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my w[SEQ_SPLITTER]oes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]QUEEN MARGARET:
Bear with me; I am hungry for reve[SEQ_SPLITTER]nge,
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
Thy Edwa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
Thy other E[SEQ_SPLITTER]dward dead, to quit my Edward;
Young York he is bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t boot, because both they
Match not the high perfe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ction of my loss:
Thy Clarence he is dead that kil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l'd my Edward;
And the beholders of this tragic pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay,
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
Richar[SEQ_SPLITTER]d yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
Only rese[SEQ_SPLITTER]rved their factor, to buy souls
And send them thit[SEQ_SPLITTER]her: but at hand, at hand,
Ensues his piteous and [SEQ_SPLITTER]unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar[SEQ_SPLITTER], saints pray.
To have him suddenly convey'd away.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
That I[SEQ_SPLITTER] may live to say, The dog is dead!

QUEEN ELIZABET[SEQ_SPLITTER]H:
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] I should wish for thee to help me curse
That bott[SEQ_SPLITTER]led spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!

QUEEN MA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RGARET:
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my for[SEQ_SPLITTER]tune;
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted quee[SEQ_SPLITTER]n;
The presentation of but what I was;
The flatter[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing index of a direful pageant;
One heaved a-high,[SEQ_SPLITTER] to be hurl'd down below;
A mother only mock'd wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h two sweet babes;
A dream of what thou wert, a br[SEQ_SPLITTER]eath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
A queen in [SEQ_SPLITTER]jest, only to fill the scene.
Where is thy husband[SEQ_SPLITTER] now? where be thy brothers?
Where are thy childre[SEQ_SPLITTER]n? wherein dost thou, joy?
Who sues to thee and cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ies 'God save the queen'?
Where be the bending pee[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs that flatter'd thee?
Where be the thronging tro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ops that follow'd thee?
Decline all this, and see [SEQ_SPLITTER]what now thou art:
For happy wife, a most distress[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed widow;
For joyful mother, one that wails the na[SEQ_SPLITTER]me;
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
For on[SEQ_SPLITTER]e that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
For one b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eing fear'd of all, now fearing one;
For one comma[SEQ_SPLITTER]nding all, obey'd of none.
Thus hath the course of[SEQ_SPLITTER] justice wheel'd about,
And left thee but a very p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rey to time;
Having no more but thought of what th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou wert,
To torture thee the more, being what thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] art.
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
Now thy p[SEQ_SPLITTER]roud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
From which[SEQ_SPLITTER] even here I slip my weary neck,
And leave the bur[SEQ_SPLITTER]then of it all on thee.
Farewell, York's wife, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] queen of sad mischance:
These English woes will m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake me smile in France.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O thou w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
And teach me h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow to curse mine enemies!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Forbear[SEQ_SPLITTER] to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
Compare d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ead happiness with living woe;
Think that thy babe[SEQ_SPLITTER]s were fairer than they were,
And he that slew the[SEQ_SPLITTER]m fouler than he is:
Bettering thy loss makes the [SEQ_SPLITTER]bad causer worse:
Revolving this will teach thee h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow to curse.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My words are dull; [SEQ_SPLITTER]O, quicken them with thine!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy w[SEQ_SPLITTER]oes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.

D[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCHESS OF YORK:
Why should calamity be full of wor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Windy attorneys to their cli[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent woes,
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
Poor [SEQ_SPLITTER]breathing orators of miseries!
Let them have scope[SEQ_SPLITTER]: though what they do impart
Help not all, yet do [SEQ_SPLITTER]they ease the heart.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
If so, then[SEQ_SPLITTER] be not tongue-tied: go with me.
And in the breath[SEQ_SPLITTER] of bitter words let's smother
My damned son, whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h thy two sweet sons smother'd.
I hear his drum: b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e copious in exclaims.

KING RICHARD III:
Who inte[SEQ_SPLITTER]rcepts my expedition?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, she tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t might have intercepted thee,
By strangling thee [SEQ_SPLITTER]in her accursed womb
From all the slaughters, wret[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch, that thou hast done!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Hidest [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou that forehead with a golden crown,
Where shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld be graven, if that right were right,
The slaugh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter of the prince that owed that crown,
And the di[SEQ_SPLITTER]re death of my two sons and brothers?
Tell me, tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u villain slave, where are my children?

DUCHESS O[SEQ_SPLITTER]F YORK:
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother[SEQ_SPLITTER] Clarence?
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

Q[SEQ_SPLITTER]UEEN ELIZABETH:
Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Va[SEQ_SPLITTER]ughan, Grey?

KING RICHARD III:
A flourish, trumpe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts! strike alarum, drums!
Let not the heavens hear[SEQ_SPLITTER] these tell-tale women
Rail on the Lord's enointed[SEQ_SPLITTER]: strike, I say!
Either be patient, and entreat me[SEQ_SPLITTER] fair,
Or with the clamorous report of war
Thus wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll I drown your exclamations.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thou my son?

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, I thank God,[SEQ_SPLITTER] my father, and yourself.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Then p[SEQ_SPLITTER]atiently hear my impatience.

KING RICHARD III:
Ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]dam, I have a touch of your condition,
Which canno[SEQ_SPLITTER]t brook the accent of reproof.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O[SEQ_SPLITTER], let me speak!

KING RICHARD III:
Do then: but I'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll not hear.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will be mild and [SEQ_SPLITTER]gentle in my speech.

KING RICHARD III:
And brief,[SEQ_SPLITTER] good mother; for I am in haste.

DUCHESS OF YORK:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
God kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ows, in anguish, pain and agony.

KING RICHARD III[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
And came I not at last to comfort you?

DUCHESS [SEQ_SPLITTER]OF YORK:
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l,
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightf[SEQ_SPLITTER]ul, desperate, wild, and furious,
Thy prime of man[SEQ_SPLITTER]hood daring, bold, and venturous,
Thy age confirm'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, proud, subdued, bloody,
treacherous,
More mild,[SEQ_SPLITTER] but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
What comfor[SEQ_SPLITTER]table hour canst thou name,
That ever graced me in[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy company?

KING RICHARD III:
Faith, none, but [SEQ_SPLITTER]Humphrey Hour, that call'd
your grace
To breakfast[SEQ_SPLITTER] once forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious [SEQ_SPLITTER]in your sight,
Let me march on, and not offend you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r grace.
Strike the drum.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I prit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee, hear me speak.

KING RICHARD III:
You speak t[SEQ_SPLITTER]oo bitterly.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hear me a word;
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] I shall never speak to thee again.

KING RICHARD [SEQ_SPLITTER]III:
So.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Either thou wilt die, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y God's just ordinance,
Ere from this war thou tur[SEQ_SPLITTER]n a conqueror,
Or I with grief and extreme age sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll perish
And never look upon thy face again.
Ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]efore take with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the day of battle, tire thee more
Than all the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]omplete armour that thou wear'st!
My prayers on th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e adverse party fight;
And there the little souls [SEQ_SPLITTER]of Edward's children
Whisper the spirits of thine [SEQ_SPLITTER]enemies
And promise them success and victory.
Bloo[SEQ_SPLITTER]dy thou art, bloody will be thy end;
Shame serves [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy life and doth thy death attend.

QUEEN ELIZABE[SEQ_SPLITTER]TH:
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to[SEQ_SPLITTER] curse
Abides in me; I say amen to all.

KING RICH[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARD III:
Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you[SEQ_SPLITTER].

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I have no more sons of the roy[SEQ_SPLITTER]al blood
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Ric[SEQ_SPLITTER]hard,
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping quee[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns;
And therefore level not to hit their lives.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING RICHARD III:
You have a daughter call'd Elizab[SEQ_SPLITTER]eth,
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

QUEEN[SEQ_SPLITTER] ELIZABETH:
And must she die for this? O, let her [SEQ_SPLITTER]live,
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beau[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty;
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
Throw[SEQ_SPLITTER] over her the veil of infamy:
So she may live unsc[SEQ_SPLITTER]arr'd of bleeding slaughter,
I will confess she wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s not Edward's daughter.

KING RICHARD III:
Wrong [SEQ_SPLITTER]not her birth, she is of royal blood.

QUEEN ELIZA[SEQ_SPLITTER]BETH:
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING RICHARD III:
Her life is only safest in her bi[SEQ_SPLITTER]rth.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And only in that safety die[SEQ_SPLITTER]d her brothers.

KING RICHARD III:
Lo, at their bi[SEQ_SPLITTER]rths good stars were opposite.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, to their lives bad friends were contrary.

KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] RICHARD III:
All unavoided is the doom of destiny[SEQ_SPLITTER].

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
True, when avoided grace makes[SEQ_SPLITTER] destiny:
My babes were destined to a fairer death[SEQ_SPLITTER],
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING RICHARD III:
You speak as if that I had slain [SEQ_SPLITTER]my cousins.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed; and[SEQ_SPLITTER] by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, kingdom, kindr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed, freedom, life.
Whose hand soever lanced their [SEQ_SPLITTER]tender hearts,
Thy head, all indirectly, gave dire[SEQ_SPLITTER]ction:
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and b[SEQ_SPLITTER]lunt
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
But that sti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll use of grief makes wild grief tame,
My tongue s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hould to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my na[SEQ_SPLITTER]ils were anchor'd in thine eyes;
And I, in such a [SEQ_SPLITTER]desperate bay of death,
Like a poor bark, of sails[SEQ_SPLITTER] and tackling reft,
Rush all to pieces on thy rock[SEQ_SPLITTER]y bosom.

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, so thrive I in [SEQ_SPLITTER]my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars[SEQ_SPLITTER],
As I intend more good to you and yours,
Than eve[SEQ_SPLITTER]r you or yours were by me wrong'd!

QUEEN ELIZABET[SEQ_SPLITTER]H:
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o be discover'd, that can do me good?

KING RICHAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]D III:
The advancement of your children, gentle la[SEQ_SPLITTER]dy.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Up to some scaffold, there t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o lose their heads?

KING RICHARD III:
No, to the [SEQ_SPLITTER]dignity and height of honour
The high imperial typ[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of this earth's glory.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Flatter[SEQ_SPLITTER] my sorrows with report of it;
Tell me what state,[SEQ_SPLITTER] what dignity, what honour,
Canst thou demise to a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ny child of mine?

KING RICHARD III:
Even all I ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve; yea, and myself and all,
Will I withal endow a[SEQ_SPLITTER] child of thine;
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich thou supposest I have done to thee.

QUEEN ELI[SEQ_SPLITTER]ZABETH:
Be brief, lest that be process of thy kind[SEQ_SPLITTER]ness
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
KING RICHARD III:
Then know, that from my soul I [SEQ_SPLITTER]love thy daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My daughter's[SEQ_SPLITTER] mother thinks it with her soul.

KING RICHARD III[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
What do you think?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That thou d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ost love my daughter from thy soul:
So from thy so[SEQ_SPLITTER]ul's love didst thou love her brothers;
And from m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y heart's love I do thank thee for it.

KING RICHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD III:
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
And m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ean to make her queen of England.

QUEEN ELIZABETH[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
KING RICHARD III:
Even he that makes her queen wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]o should be else?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What, thou?

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING RICHARD III:
I, even I: what think you of it, [SEQ_SPLITTER]madam?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How canst thou woo her?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING RICHARD III:
That would I learn of you,
As on[SEQ_SPLITTER]e that are best acquainted with her humour.

QUEEN[SEQ_SPLITTER] ELIZABETH:
And wilt thou learn of me?

KING RICHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD III:
Madam, with all my heart.

QUEEN ELIZABETH[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
Edward [SEQ_SPLITTER]and York; then haply she will weep:
Therefore pres[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent to her--as sometime Margaret
Did to thy father[SEQ_SPLITTER], steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
A handkerchief; wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich, say to her, did drain
The purple sap from her[SEQ_SPLITTER] sweet brother's body
And bid her dry her weeping [SEQ_SPLITTER]eyes therewith.
If this inducement force her not t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o love,
Send her a story of thy noble acts;
Tell h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
Her uncle [SEQ_SPLITTER]Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
Madest quick conve[SEQ_SPLITTER]yance with her good aunt Anne.

KING RICHARD III:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
To wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]n our daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
There is no othe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r way
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And not be Richard that hath done all this.

KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] RICHARD III:
Say that I did all this for love of [SEQ_SPLITTER]her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Nay, then indeed she cannot[SEQ_SPLITTER] choose but hate thee,
Having bought love with suc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h a bloody spoil.

KING RICHARD III:
Look, what is[SEQ_SPLITTER] done cannot be now amended:
Men shall deal unadvi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sedly sometimes,
Which after hours give leisure to[SEQ_SPLITTER] repent.
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
If [SEQ_SPLITTER]I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
To quicken y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your bloo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d upon your daughter
A grandam's name is little le[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss in love
Than is the doting title of a mother;
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hey are as children but one step below,
Even of yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur mettle, of your very blood;
Of an one pain, sav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e for a night of groans
Endured of her, for whom y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou bid like sorrow.
Your children were vexation to[SEQ_SPLITTER] your youth,
But mine shall be a comfort to your a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ge.
The loss you have is but a son being king,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] by that loss your daughter is made queen.
I canno[SEQ_SPLITTER]t make you what amends I would,
Therefore accept s[SEQ_SPLITTER]uch kindness as I can.
Dorset your son, that with [SEQ_SPLITTER]a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps in foreign[SEQ_SPLITTER] soil,
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To high promotions and great dignity:
The king, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at calls your beauteous daughter wife.
Familiarly [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall call thy Dorset brother;
Again shall you be [SEQ_SPLITTER]mother to a king,
And all the ruins of distressful[SEQ_SPLITTER] times
Repair'd with double riches of content.
Wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t! we have many goodly days to see:
The liquid dro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ps of tears that you have shed
Shall come again, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ransform'd to orient pearl,
Advantaging their loan[SEQ_SPLITTER] with interest
Of ten times double gain of happine[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss.
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
Make bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld her bashful years with your experience;
Prepare[SEQ_SPLITTER] her ears to hear a wooer's tale
Put in her tender[SEQ_SPLITTER] heart the aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty; a[SEQ_SPLITTER]cquaint the princess
With the sweet silent hours o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f marriage joys
And when this arm of mine hath cha[SEQ_SPLITTER]stised
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ound with triumphant garlands will I come
And lead[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
To whom I will[SEQ_SPLITTER] retail my conquest won,
And she shall be sole vic[SEQ_SPLITTER]tress, Caesar's Caesar.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What wer[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I best to say? her father's brother
Would be her[SEQ_SPLITTER] lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
Or, he that slew[SEQ_SPLITTER] her brothers and her uncles?
Under what title sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll I woo for thee,
That God, the law, my honour an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d her love,
Can make seem pleasing to her tender y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ears?

KING RICHARD III:
Infer fair England's peac[SEQ_SPLITTER]e by this alliance.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Which she sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all purchase with still lasting war.

KING RICHARD[SEQ_SPLITTER] III:
Say that the king, which may command, entrea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her hands which the [SEQ_SPLITTER]king's King forbids.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, she s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall be a high and mighty queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To wail the tide, as her mother doth.

KING RICHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD III:
Say, I will love her everlastingly.

QUEEN[SEQ_SPLITTER] ELIZABETH:
But how long shall that title 'ever' l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ast?

KING RICHARD III:
Sweetly in force unto her [SEQ_SPLITTER]fair life's end.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how long fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]irly shall her sweet lie last?

KING RICHARD III:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.

QUEEN [SEQ_SPLITTER]ELIZABETH:
So long as hell and Richard likes of it[SEQ_SPLITTER].

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I, her sovereign, am her[SEQ_SPLITTER] subject love.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But she, your sub[SEQ_SPLITTER]ject, loathes such sovereignty.

KING RICHARD III:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING RICHARD III:
Then in plain terms tell her my [SEQ_SPLITTER]loving tale.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Plain and not hones[SEQ_SPLITTER]t is too harsh a style.

KING RICHARD III:
Your re[SEQ_SPLITTER]asons are too shallow and too quick.

QUEEN ELIZAB[SEQ_SPLITTER]ETH:
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
Too d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.

KING [SEQ_SPLITTER]RICHARD III:
Harp not on that string, madam; that [SEQ_SPLITTER]is past.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Harp on it still shall [SEQ_SPLITTER]I till heart-strings break.

KING RICHARD III:
Now[SEQ_SPLITTER], by my George, my garter, and my crown,--

QUEEN [SEQ_SPLITTER]ELIZABETH:
Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third us[SEQ_SPLITTER]urp'd.

KING RICHARD III:
I swear--

QUEEN ELIZABE[SEQ_SPLITTER]TH:
By nothing; for this is no oath:
The George, p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rofaned, hath lost his holy honour;
The garter, bl[SEQ_SPLITTER]emish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
The crown, us[SEQ_SPLITTER]urp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
if something th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou wilt swear to be believed,
Swear then by someth[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing that thou hast not wrong'd.

KING RICHARD III:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Now, by the world--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
'Tis full o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f thy foul wrongs.

KING RICHARD III:
My father's [SEQ_SPLITTER]death--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thy life hath that disho[SEQ_SPLITTER]nour'd.

KING RICHARD III:
Then, by myself--

QUEE[SEQ_SPLITTER]N ELIZABETH:
Thyself thyself misusest.

KING RICHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD III:
Why then, by God--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
God's[SEQ_SPLITTER] wrong is most of all.
If thou hadst fear'd to bre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ak an oath by Him,
The unity the king thy brother [SEQ_SPLITTER]made
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
If[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The im[SEQ_SPLITTER]perial metal, circling now thy brow,
Had graced th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e tender temples of my child,
And both the princes[SEQ_SPLITTER] had been breathing here,
Which now, two tender pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ayfellows to dust,
Thy broken faith hath made a pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey for worms.
What canst thou swear by now?

KING [SEQ_SPLITTER]RICHARD III:
The time to come.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
For I [SEQ_SPLITTER]myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time, for[SEQ_SPLITTER] time past wrong'd by thee.
The children live, who[SEQ_SPLITTER]se parents thou hast
slaughter'd,
Ungovern'd youth[SEQ_SPLITTER], to wail it in their age;
The parents live, whose[SEQ_SPLITTER] children thou hast butcher'd,
Old wither'd plants[SEQ_SPLITTER], to wail it with their age.
Swear not by time to [SEQ_SPLITTER]come; for that thou hast
Misused ere used, by time[SEQ_SPLITTER] misused o'erpast.

KING RICHARD III:
As I intend [SEQ_SPLITTER]to prosper and repent,
So thrive I in my dangerous[SEQ_SPLITTER] attempt
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield [SEQ_SPLITTER]me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Be opposit[SEQ_SPLITTER]e all planets of good luck
To my proceedings, if, [SEQ_SPLITTER]with pure heart's love,
Immaculate devotion, holy [SEQ_SPLITTER]thoughts,
I tender not thy beauteous princely daug[SEQ_SPLITTER]hter!
In her consists my happiness and thine;
With[SEQ_SPLITTER]out her, follows to this land and me,
To thee, her[SEQ_SPLITTER]self, and many a Christian soul,
Death, desolation[SEQ_SPLITTER], ruin and decay:
It cannot be avoided but by this[SEQ_SPLITTER];
It will not be avoided but by this.
Therefore, g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood mother,--I must can you so--
Be the attorney o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f my love to her:
Plead what I will be, not what I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have been;
Not my deserts, but what I will deserv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e:
Urge the necessity and state of times,
And be n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot peevish-fond in great designs.

QUEEN ELIZABETH[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

KING RICH[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARD III:
Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I forget myself to be mysel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f?

KING RICHARD III:
Ay, if yourself's remembranc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e wrong yourself.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But thou didst[SEQ_SPLITTER] kill my children.

KING RICHARD III:
But in your [SEQ_SPLITTER]daughter's womb I bury them:
Where in that nest of[SEQ_SPLITTER] spicery they shall breed
Selves of themselves, to[SEQ_SPLITTER] your recomforture.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Shall I go w[SEQ_SPLITTER]in my daughter to thy will?

KING RICHARD III:
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] be a happy mother by the deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I go. Write to me very shortly.
And you shall unde[SEQ_SPLITTER]rstand from me her mind.

KING RICHARD III:
Bear h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
Relentin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g fool, and shallow, changing woman!
How now! what[SEQ_SPLITTER] news?

RATCLIFF:
My gracious sovereign, on the we[SEQ_SPLITTER]stern coast
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hrong many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
Unarm'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, and unresolved to beat them back:
'Tis thought [SEQ_SPLITTER]that Richmond is their admiral;
And there they hul[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, expecting but the aid
Of Buckingham to welcome [SEQ_SPLITTER]them ashore.

KING RICHARD III:
Some light-foot fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
Ratcliff, thysel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f, or Catesby; where is he?

CATESBY:
Here, my lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.

KING RICHARD III:
Fly to the duke:
Post thou t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o Salisbury
When thou comest thither--
Dull, unmin[SEQ_SPLITTER]dful villain,
Why stand'st thou still, and go'st n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot to the duke?

CATESBY:
First, mighty sovereign,[SEQ_SPLITTER] let me know your mind,
What from your grace I sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll deliver to him.

KING RICHARD III:
O, true, goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d Catesby: bid him levy straight
The greatest stre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngth and power he can make,
And meet me presently [SEQ_SPLITTER]at Salisbury.

CATESBY:
I go.

RATCLIFF:
What is't[SEQ_SPLITTER] your highness' pleasure I shall do at
Salisbury?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
KING RICHARD III:
Why, what wouldst thou do there[SEQ_SPLITTER] before I go?

RATCLIFF:
Your highness told me I s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hould post before.

KING RICHARD III:
My mind is c[SEQ_SPLITTER]hanged, sir, my mind is changed.
How now, what new[SEQ_SPLITTER]s with you?

STANLEY:
None good, my lord, to pleas[SEQ_SPLITTER]e you with the hearing;
Nor none so bad, but it ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y well be told.

KING RICHARD III:
Hoyday, a riddl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou run so many[SEQ_SPLITTER] mile about,
When thou mayst tell thy tale a neare[SEQ_SPLITTER]r way?
Once more, what news?

STANLEY:
Richmond is[SEQ_SPLITTER] on the seas.

KING RICHARD III:
There let him sin[SEQ_SPLITTER]k, and be the seas on him!
White-liver'd runagate,[SEQ_SPLITTER] what doth he there?

STANLEY:
I know not, mighty [SEQ_SPLITTER]sovereign, but by guess.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir, as you guess, as you guess?

STANLEY:
Stirr'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
He makes for E[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngland, there to claim the crown.

KING RICHARD II[SEQ_SPLITTER]I:
Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
Is t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
What heir of[SEQ_SPLITTER] York is there alive but we?
And who is England's [SEQ_SPLITTER]king but great York's heir?
Then, tell me, what do[SEQ_SPLITTER]th he upon the sea?

STANLEY:
Unless for that, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]liege, I cannot guess.

KING RICHARD III:
Unless f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or that he comes to be your liege,
You cannot gues[SEQ_SPLITTER]s wherefore the Welshman comes.
Thou wilt revolt, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and fly to him, I fear.

STANLEY:
No, mighty liege[SEQ_SPLITTER]; therefore mistrust me not.

KING RICHARD III:
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere is thy power, then, to beat him back?
Where ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not now [SEQ_SPLITTER]upon the western shore.
Safe-conducting the rebels[SEQ_SPLITTER] from their ships!

STANLEY:
No, my good lord, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]friends are in the north.

KING RICHARD III:
Cold [SEQ_SPLITTER]friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
Whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]n they should serve their sovereign in the west?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]STANLEY:
They have not been commanded, mighty sove[SEQ_SPLITTER]reign:
Please it your majesty to give me leave,
I'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
Where[SEQ_SPLITTER] and what time your majesty shall please.

KING RI[SEQ_SPLITTER]CHARD III:
Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th Richmond:
I will not trust you, sir.

STANLEY:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Most mighty sovereign,
You have no cause to hold m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y friendship doubtful:
I never was nor never will [SEQ_SPLITTER]be false.

KING RICHARD III:
Well,
Go muster men; [SEQ_SPLITTER]but, hear you, leave behind
Your son, George Stanl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey: look your faith be firm.
Or else his head's as[SEQ_SPLITTER]surance is but frail.

STANLEY:
So deal with him a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s I prove true to you.

Messenger:
My gracious sov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ereign, now in Devonshire,
As I by friends am well[SEQ_SPLITTER] advertised,
Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty [SEQ_SPLITTER]prelate
Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,
With [SEQ_SPLITTER]many more confederates, are in arms.

Second Messe[SEQ_SPLITTER]nger:
My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms[SEQ_SPLITTER];
And every hour more competitors
Flock to their a[SEQ_SPLITTER]id, and still their power increaseth.

Third Messe[SEQ_SPLITTER]nger:
My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-

KING RICHARD III:
Out on you, owls! nothing but[SEQ_SPLITTER] songs of death?
Take that, until thou bring me be[SEQ_SPLITTER]tter news.

Third Messenger:
The news I have to te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll your majesty
Is, that by sudden floods and fall[SEQ_SPLITTER] of waters,
Buckingham's army is dispersed and sca[SEQ_SPLITTER]tter'd;
And he himself wander'd away alone,
No man[SEQ_SPLITTER] knows whither.

KING RICHARD III:
I cry thee merc[SEQ_SPLITTER]y:
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
Reward to h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im that brings the traitor in?

Third Messenger:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]uch proclamation hath been made, my liege.

Fourth[SEQ_SPLITTER] Messenger:
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dors[SEQ_SPLITTER]et,
'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
Richmond, in [SEQ_SPLITTER]Yorkshire, sent out a boat
Unto the shore, to ask [SEQ_SPLITTER]those on the banks
If they were his assistants, ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]a or no;
Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingh[SEQ_SPLITTER]am.
Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
Hoisted [SEQ_SPLITTER]sail and made away for Brittany.

KING RICHARD III[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
If [SEQ_SPLITTER]not to fight with foreign enemies,
Yet to beat dow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n these rebels here at home.

CATESBY:
My liege, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he Duke of Buckingham is taken;
That is the best n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ews: that the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty po[SEQ_SPLITTER]wer landed at Milford,
Is colder tidings, yet they[SEQ_SPLITTER] must be told.

KING RICHARD III:
Away towards Sal[SEQ_SPLITTER]isbury! while we reason here,
A royal battle might[SEQ_SPLITTER] be won and lost
Some one take order Buckingham be[SEQ_SPLITTER] brought
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
DERBY:
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e:
That in the sty of this most bloody boar
My son[SEQ_SPLITTER] George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
If I revolt[SEQ_SPLITTER], off goes young George's head;
The fear of that w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ithholds my present aid.
But, tell me, where is pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]incely Richmond now?

CHRISTOPHER:
At Pembroke, or[SEQ_SPLITTER] at Harford-west, in Wales.

DERBY:
What men of na[SEQ_SPLITTER]me resort to him?

CHRISTOPHER:
Sir Walter Herbert[SEQ_SPLITTER], a renowned soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir Will[SEQ_SPLITTER]iam Stanley;
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James[SEQ_SPLITTER] Blunt,
And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d many more of noble fame and worth:
And towards L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ondon they do bend their course,
If by the way the[SEQ_SPLITTER]y be not fought withal.

DERBY:
Return unto thy lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd; commend me to him:
Tell him the queen hath hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtily consented
He shall espouse Elizabeth her dau[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghter.
These letters will resolve him of my mind. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Farewell.

BUCKINGHAM:
Will not King Richard let m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e speak with him?

Sheriff:
No, my good lord; ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]efore be patient.

BUCKINGHAM:
Hastings, and Edwar[SEQ_SPLITTER]d's children, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry, and t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy fair son Edward,
Vaughan, and all that have mis[SEQ_SPLITTER]carried
By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
If [SEQ_SPLITTER]that your moody discontented souls
Do through the [SEQ_SPLITTER]clouds behold this present hour,
Even for revenge [SEQ_SPLITTER]mock my destruction!
This is All-Souls' day, fello[SEQ_SPLITTER]ws, is it not?

Sheriff:
It is, my lord.

BUCKINGH[SEQ_SPLITTER]AM:
Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday[SEQ_SPLITTER].
This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ish't might fall on me, when I was found
False to [SEQ_SPLITTER]his children or his wife's allies
This is the day [SEQ_SPLITTER]wherein I wish'd to fall
By the false faith of him[SEQ_SPLITTER] I trusted most;
This, this All-Souls' day to my f[SEQ_SPLITTER]earful soul
Is the determined respite of my wrongs[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
That high All-Seer that I dallied with
Hath turn[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d my feigned prayer on my head
And given in earne[SEQ_SPLITTER]st what I begg'd in jest.
Thus doth he force the s[SEQ_SPLITTER]words of wicked men
To turn their own points on th[SEQ_SPLITTER]eir masters' bosoms:
Now Margaret's curse is falle[SEQ_SPLITTER]n upon my head;
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy heart with sorrow,
Remember Margaret was a pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ophetess.'
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hame;
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of b[SEQ_SPLITTER]lame.

RICHMOND:
Fellows in arms, and my most lovi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng friends,
Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Have we mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch'd on without impediment;
And here receive we fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om our father Stanley
Lines of fair comfort and en[SEQ_SPLITTER]couragement.
The wretched, bloody, and usurping bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar,
That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ines,
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes [SEQ_SPLITTER]his trough
In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul sw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ine
Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
Near[SEQ_SPLITTER] to the town of Leicester, as we learn
From Tamwor[SEQ_SPLITTER]th thither is but one day's march.
In God's name, [SEQ_SPLITTER]cheerly on, courageous friends,
To reap the harves[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of s[SEQ_SPLITTER]harp war.

OXFORD:
Every man's conscience is a tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]usand swords,
To fight against that bloody homicid[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

HERBERT:
I doubt not but his friends will fly [SEQ_SPLITTER]to us.

BLUNT:
He hath no friends but who are frie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds for fear.
Which in his greatest need will shri[SEQ_SPLITTER]nk from him.

RICHMOND:
All for our vantage. Then,[SEQ_SPLITTER] in God's name, march:
True hope is swift, and fli[SEQ_SPLITTER]es with swallow's wings:
Kings it makes gods, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]meaner creatures kings.

KING RICHARD III:
Here pi[SEQ_SPLITTER]tch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d of Surrey, why look you so sad?

SURREY:
My hear[SEQ_SPLITTER]t is ten times lighter than my looks.

KING RICHAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]D III:
My Lord of Norfolk,--

NORFOLK:
Here, most [SEQ_SPLITTER]gracious liege.

KING RICHARD III:
Norfolk, we mus[SEQ_SPLITTER]t have knocks; ha! must we not?

NORFOLK:
We must [SEQ_SPLITTER]both give and take, my gracious lord.

KING RICHAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]D III:
Up with my tent there! here will I lie toni[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght;
But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t.
Who hath descried the number of the foe?

NORFO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LK:
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING RICHARD III:
Why, our battalion trebles that [SEQ_SPLITTER]account:
Besides, the king's name is a tower of st[SEQ_SPLITTER]rength,
Which they upon the adverse party want.
Up[SEQ_SPLITTER] with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
Let us sur[SEQ_SPLITTER]vey the vantage of the field
Call for some men of [SEQ_SPLITTER]sound direction
Let's want no discipline, make no [SEQ_SPLITTER]delay,
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.

RICHM[SEQ_SPLITTER]OND:
The weary sun hath made a golden set,
And by [SEQ_SPLITTER]the bright track of his fiery car,
Gives signal, o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f a goodly day to-morrow.
Sir William Brandon, you[SEQ_SPLITTER] shall bear my standard.
Give me some ink and pape[SEQ_SPLITTER]r in my tent
I'll draw the form and model of our b[SEQ_SPLITTER]attle,
Limit each leader to his several charge,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d part in just proportion our small strength.
My L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
And you, [SEQ_SPLITTER]Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
The Earl of Pemb[SEQ_SPLITTER]roke keeps his regiment:
Good Captain Blunt, bear [SEQ_SPLITTER]my good night to him
And by the second hour in the[SEQ_SPLITTER] morning
Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
Yet[SEQ_SPLITTER] one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?

BL[SEQ_SPLITTER]UNT:
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
Whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h well I am assured I have not done,
His regiment [SEQ_SPLITTER]lies half a mile at least
South from the mighty po[SEQ_SPLITTER]wer of the king.

RICHMOND:
If without peril it be[SEQ_SPLITTER] possible,
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night [SEQ_SPLITTER]to him,
And give him from me this most needful scr[SEQ_SPLITTER]oll.

BLUNT:
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-tak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e it;
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!

R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ICHMOND:
Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gent[SEQ_SPLITTER]lemen,
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
In[SEQ_SPLITTER] to our tent; the air is raw and cold.

KING RICHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD III:
What is't o'clock?

CATESBY:
It's supper-t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ime, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

KING RICHARD III[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I will not sup to-night.
Give me some ink and pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]per.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l my armour laid into my tent?

CATESBY:
If is, my[SEQ_SPLITTER] liege; and all things are in readiness.

KING RIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]HARD III:
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
Us[SEQ_SPLITTER]e careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.

NORFOLK[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I go, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Stir with the [SEQ_SPLITTER]lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.

NORFOLK:
I warran[SEQ_SPLITTER]t you, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

CATES[SEQ_SPLITTER]BY:
My lord?

KING RICHARD III:
Send out a pursuiv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ant at arms
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is power
Before sunrising, lest his son George fal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
Fill me a [SEQ_SPLITTER]bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddle white Surrey[SEQ_SPLITTER] for the field to-morrow.
Look that my staves be s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ound, and not too heavy.
Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
My l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord?

KING RICHARD III:
Saw'st thou the melancholy[SEQ_SPLITTER] Lord Northumberland?

RATCLIFF:
Thomas the Earl o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f Surrey, and himself,
Much about cock-shut time, [SEQ_SPLITTER]from troop to troop
Went through the army, cheerin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g up the soldiers.

KING RICHARD III:
So, I am sat[SEQ_SPLITTER]isfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
I have not that al[SEQ_SPLITTER]acrity of spirit,
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt to have.
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]RATCLIFF:
It is, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Bid m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y guard watch; leave me.
Ratcliff, about the mid o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f night come to my tent
And help to arm me. Leave [SEQ_SPLITTER]me, I say.

DERBY:
Fortune and victory sit on thy [SEQ_SPLITTER]helm!

RICHMOND:
All comfort that the dark night c[SEQ_SPLITTER]an afford
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell me, how fares our loving mother?

DERBY:
I, by[SEQ_SPLITTER] attorney, bless thee from thy mother
Who prays co[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntinually for Richmond's good:
So much for that. T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness break[SEQ_SPLITTER]s within the east.
In brief,--for so the season bi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds us be,--
Prepare thy battle early in the mornin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g,
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
Of blood[SEQ_SPLITTER]y strokes and mortal-staring war.
I, as I may--tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t which I would I cannot,--
With best advantage wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll deceive the time,
And aid thee in this doubtful[SEQ_SPLITTER] shock of arms:
But on thy side I may not be too f[SEQ_SPLITTER]orward
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender Georg[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
Be executed in his father's sight.
Farewell: th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet [SEQ_SPLITTER]discourse,
Which so long sunder'd friends should d[SEQ_SPLITTER]well upon:
God give us leisure for these rites of [SEQ_SPLITTER]love!
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

RICHMOND:
Good lords, conduct him to his regime[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt:
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a[SEQ_SPLITTER] nap,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
When I should mount with wings of victory:
Once m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
O Thou,[SEQ_SPLITTER] whose captain I account myself,
Look on my forces[SEQ_SPLITTER] with a gracious eye;
Put in their hands thy bruis[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing irons of wrath,
That they may crush down with [SEQ_SPLITTER]a heavy fall
The usurping helmets of our adversari[SEQ_SPLITTER]es!
Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
That we[SEQ_SPLITTER] may praise thee in the victory!
To thee I do comm[SEQ_SPLITTER]end my watchful soul,
Ere I let fall the windows o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f mine eyes:
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me sti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll!

Ghost of Prince Edward:

Ghost of King Henry [SEQ_SPLITTER]VI:

Ghost of CLARENCE:

Ghost of RIVERS:

Ghost o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f GREY:

Ghost of VAUGHAN:

All:

Ghost of HASTING[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:

Ghosts of young Princes:

Ghost of LADY ANNE:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Ghost of BUCKINGHAM:

KING RICHARD III:
Give me a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nother horse: bind up my wounds.
Have mercy, Jesu![SEQ_SPLITTER]--Soft! I did but dream.
O coward conscience, how [SEQ_SPLITTER]dost thou afflict me!
The lights burn blue. It is [SEQ_SPLITTER]now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my [SEQ_SPLITTER]trembling flesh.
What do I fear?  myself?  there's[SEQ_SPLITTER] none else by:
Richard loves Richard; that is, I a[SEQ_SPLITTER]m I.
Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
The[SEQ_SPLITTER]n fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
Lest[SEQ_SPLITTER] I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
Alack. I lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e myself. Wherefore?  for any good
That I myself h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave done unto myself?
O, no! alas, I rather hate m[SEQ_SPLITTER]yself
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
I am [SEQ_SPLITTER]a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
Fool, of thyself s[SEQ_SPLITTER]peak well: fool, do not flatter.
My conscience hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h a thousand several tongues,
And every tongue bri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngs in a several tale,
And every tale condemns me [SEQ_SPLITTER]for a villain.
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st de[SEQ_SPLITTER]gree
Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
Al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l several sins, all used in each degree,
Throng to[SEQ_SPLITTER] the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
I shall desp[SEQ_SPLITTER]air. There is no creature loves me;
And if I die, [SEQ_SPLITTER]no soul shall pity me:
Nay, wherefore should they,[SEQ_SPLITTER] since that I myself
Find in myself no pity to mys[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf?
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d
Came to my tent; and every one did threat
To-mor[SEQ_SPLITTER]row's vengeance on the head of Richard.

RATCLIFF:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
'Zounds! who is there[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

RATCLIFF:
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early [SEQ_SPLITTER]village-cock
Hath twice done salutation to the mor[SEQ_SPLITTER]n;
Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour[SEQ_SPLITTER].

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a [SEQ_SPLITTER]fearful dream!
What thinkest thou, will our friend[SEQ_SPLITTER]s prove all true?

RATCLIFF:
No doubt, my lord.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--

RA[SEQ_SPLITTER]TCLIFF:
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadow[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.

KING RICHARD III:
By the apostle Paul, shadows[SEQ_SPLITTER] to-night
Have struck more terror to the soul of R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ichard
Than can the substance of ten thousand sold[SEQ_SPLITTER]iers
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
Under ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
To see if any[SEQ_SPLITTER] mean to shrink from me.

LORDS:
Good morrow, Rich[SEQ_SPLITTER]mond!

RICHMOND:
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gen[SEQ_SPLITTER]tlemen,
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

LORDS:
How have you slept, my lord?

RICHMOND:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
Have I since your d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eparture had, my lords.
Methought their souls, who[SEQ_SPLITTER]se bodies Richard murder'd,
Came to my tent, and c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ried on victory:
I promise you, my soul is very jo[SEQ_SPLITTER]cund
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
How fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]r into the morning is it, lords?

LORDS:
Upon the [SEQ_SPLITTER]stroke of four.

RICHMOND:
Why, then 'tis time to [SEQ_SPLITTER]arm and give direction.
More than I have said, lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement of the[SEQ_SPLITTER] time
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
Go[SEQ_SPLITTER]d and our good cause fight upon our side;
The pray[SEQ_SPLITTER]ers of holy saints and wronged souls,
Like high-re[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
Richard exc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ept, those whom we fight against
Had rather have u[SEQ_SPLITTER]s win than him they follow:
For what is he they fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]llow?  truly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant and a hom[SEQ_SPLITTER]icide;
One raised in blood, and one in blood estab[SEQ_SPLITTER]lish'd;
One that made means to come by what he hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h,
And slaughter'd those that were the means to he[SEQ_SPLITTER]lp him;
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foi[SEQ_SPLITTER]l
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
One[SEQ_SPLITTER] that hath ever been God's enemy:
Then, if you fig[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht against God's enemy,
God will in justice ward y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou as his soldiers;
If you do sweat to put a tyran[SEQ_SPLITTER]t down,
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain[SEQ_SPLITTER];
If you do fight against your country's foes,
You[SEQ_SPLITTER]r country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
If [SEQ_SPLITTER]you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wive[SEQ_SPLITTER]s shall welcome home the conquerors;
If you do fre[SEQ_SPLITTER]e your children from the sword,
Your children's ch[SEQ_SPLITTER]ildren quit it in your age.
Then, in the name of G[SEQ_SPLITTER]od and all these rights,
Advance your standards, d[SEQ_SPLITTER]raw your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of my [SEQ_SPLITTER]bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the eart[SEQ_SPLITTER]h's cold face;
But if I thrive, the gain of my att[SEQ_SPLITTER]empt
The least of you shall share his part thereof[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!

KING [SEQ_SPLITTER]RICHARD III:
What said Northumberland as touching [SEQ_SPLITTER]Richmond?

RATCLIFF:
That he was never trained up [SEQ_SPLITTER]in arms.

KING RICHARD III:
He said the truth: and[SEQ_SPLITTER] what said Surrey then?

RATCLIFF:
He smiled and s[SEQ_SPLITTER]aid 'The better for our purpose.'

KING RICHARD II[SEQ_SPLITTER]I:
He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
Ten t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he clock there. Give me a calendar.
Who saw the su[SEQ_SPLITTER]n to-day?

RATCLIFF:
Not I, my lord.

KING RICHARD[SEQ_SPLITTER] III:
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]e should have braved the east an hour ago
A black [SEQ_SPLITTER]day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!

RATCLIFF:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]y lord?

KING RICHARD III:
The sun will not be see[SEQ_SPLITTER]n to-day;
The sky doth frown and lour upon our arm[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
More tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
That frown[SEQ_SPLITTER]s on me looks sadly upon him.

NORFOLK:
Arm, arm, [SEQ_SPLITTER]my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.

KING RICHAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]D III:
Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
C[SEQ_SPLITTER]all up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
I wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
And thus m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y battle shall be ordered:
My foreward shall be dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]awn out all in length,
Consisting equally of horse[SEQ_SPLITTER] and foot;
Our archers shall be placed in the mids[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
Sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll have the leading of this foot and horse.
They t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hus directed, we will follow
In the main battle, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hose puissance on either side
Shall be well winged[SEQ_SPLITTER] with our chiefest horse.
This, and Saint George t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?

NORFOLK:
A g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood direction, warlike sovereign.
This found I on [SEQ_SPLITTER]my tent this morning.

KING RICHARD III:

Messenge[SEQ_SPLITTER]r:
My lord, he doth deny to come.

KING RICHARD II[SEQ_SPLITTER]I:
Off with his son George's head!

NORFOLK:
My lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd, the enemy is past the marsh
After the battle l[SEQ_SPLITTER]et George Stanley die.

KING RICHARD III:
A thousa[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd hearts are great within my bosom:
Advance our s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tandards, set upon our foes
Our ancient word of co[SEQ_SPLITTER]urage, fair Saint George,
Inspire us with the sple[SEQ_SPLITTER]en of fiery dragons!
Upon them! victory sits on ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r helms.

CATESBY:
Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, res[SEQ_SPLITTER]cue, rescue!
The king enacts more wonders than a m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an,
Daring an opposite to every danger:
His horse [SEQ_SPLITTER]is slain, and all on foot he fights,
Seeking for R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ichmond in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord,[SEQ_SPLITTER] or else the day is lost!

KING RICHARD III:
A hor[SEQ_SPLITTER]se! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

CATESBY:
Wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.

KING RI[SEQ_SPLITTER]CHARD III:
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And I will stand the hazard of the die:
I think th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere be six Richmonds in the field;
Five have I sla[SEQ_SPLITTER]in to-day instead of him.
A horse! a horse! my kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gdom for a horse!

RICHMOND:
God and your arms be [SEQ_SPLITTER]praised, victorious friends,
The day is ours, the [SEQ_SPLITTER]bloody dog is dead.

DERBY:
Courageous Richmond, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell hast thou acquit thee.
Lo, here, this long-usu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rped royalty
From the dead temples of this bloody [SEQ_SPLITTER]wretch
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows with[SEQ_SPLITTER]al:
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

RICHM[SEQ_SPLITTER]OND:
Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
But, te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll me, is young George Stanley living?

DERBY:
He [SEQ_SPLITTER]is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
Whither, [SEQ_SPLITTER]if it please you, we may now withdraw us.

RICHMON[SEQ_SPLITTER]D:
What men of name are slain on either side?

DER[SEQ_SPLITTER]BY:
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
Sir[SEQ_SPLITTER] Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.

RICH[SEQ_SPLITTER]MOND:
Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
That in sub[SEQ_SPLITTER]mission will return to us:
And then, as we have ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]'en the sacrament,
We will unite the white rose an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d the red:
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction[SEQ_SPLITTER],
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
What t[SEQ_SPLITTER]raitor hears me, and says not amen?
England hath l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ong been mad, and scarr'd herself;
The brother bli[SEQ_SPLITTER]ndly shed the brother's blood,
The father rashly s[SEQ_SPLITTER]laughter'd his own son,
The son, compell'd, been b[SEQ_SPLITTER]utcher to the sire:
All this divided York and Lanc[SEQ_SPLITTER]aster,
Divided in their dire division,
O, now, let[SEQ_SPLITTER] Richmond and Elizabeth,
The true succeeders of ea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch royal house,
By God's fair ordinance conjoin to[SEQ_SPLITTER]gether!
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o.
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace[SEQ_SPLITTER],
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
Ab[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
That woul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d reduce these bloody days again,
And make poor En[SEQ_SPLITTER]gland weep in streams of blood!
Let them not live [SEQ_SPLITTER]to taste this land's increase
That would with trea[SEQ_SPLITTER]son wound this fair land's peace!
Now civil wounds[SEQ_SPLITTER] are stopp'd, peace lives again:
That she may long[SEQ_SPLITTER] live here, God say amen!

KING RICHARD II:
Old Jo[SEQ_SPLITTER]hn of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
Hast thou, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ccording to thy oath and band,
Brought hither Henr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y Hereford thy bold son,
Here to make good the boi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sterous late appeal,
Which then our leisure would [SEQ_SPLITTER]not let us hear,
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thom[SEQ_SPLITTER]as Mowbray?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I have, my liege.

KIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]G RICHARD II:
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded[SEQ_SPLITTER] him,
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
Or [SEQ_SPLITTER]worthily, as a good subject should,
On some known [SEQ_SPLITTER]ground of treachery in him?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
As nea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r as I could sift him on that argument,
On some ap[SEQ_SPLITTER]parent danger seen in him
Aim'd at your highness, [SEQ_SPLITTER]no inveterate malice.

KING RICHARD II:
Then call [SEQ_SPLITTER]them to our presence; face to face,
And frowning b[SEQ_SPLITTER]row to brow, ourselves will hear
The accuser and t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he accused freely speak:
High-stomach'd are they b[SEQ_SPLITTER]oth, and full of ire,
In rage deaf as the sea, has[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty as fire.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Many years of happ[SEQ_SPLITTER]y days befal
My gracious sovereign, my most loving[SEQ_SPLITTER] liege!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Each day still better oth[SEQ_SPLITTER]er's happiness;
Until the heavens, envying earth's[SEQ_SPLITTER] good hap,
Add an immortal title to your crown!

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING RICHARD II:
We thank you both: yet one but fla[SEQ_SPLITTER]tters us,
As well appeareth by the cause you come;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
Cous[SEQ_SPLITTER]in of Hereford, what dost thou object
Against the [SEQ_SPLITTER]Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

HENRY BOLINGBROK[SEQ_SPLITTER]E:
First, heaven be the record to my speech!
In th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e devotion of a subject's love,
Tendering the prec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ious safety of my prince,
And free from other misb[SEQ_SPLITTER]egotten hate,
Come I appellant to this princely pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]esence.
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d mark my greeting well; for what I speak
My body [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall make good upon this earth,
Or my divine soul[SEQ_SPLITTER] answer it in heaven.
Thou art a traitor and a mis[SEQ_SPLITTER]creant,
Too good to be so and too bad to live,
Sin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce the more fair and crystal is the sky,
The uglie[SEQ_SPLITTER]r seem the clouds that in it fly.
Once more, the m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore to aggravate the note,
With a foul traitor's n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ame stuff I thy throat;
And wish, so please my sov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ereign, ere I move,
What my tongue speaks my right[SEQ_SPLITTER] drawn sword may prove.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Let not m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y cold words here accuse my zeal:
'Tis not the tri[SEQ_SPLITTER]al of a woman's war,
The bitter clamour of two eag[SEQ_SPLITTER]er tongues,
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us tw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ain;
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
As to [SEQ_SPLITTER]be hush'd and nought at all to say:
First, the fai[SEQ_SPLITTER]r reverence of your highness curbs me
From giving [SEQ_SPLITTER]reins and spurs to my free speech;
Which else woul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d post until it had return'd
These terms of treaso[SEQ_SPLITTER]n doubled down his throat.
Setting aside his high [SEQ_SPLITTER]blood's royalty,
And let him be no kinsman to my l[SEQ_SPLITTER]iege,
I do defy him, and I spit at him;
Call him a[SEQ_SPLITTER] slanderous coward and a villain:
Which to maintai[SEQ_SPLITTER]n I would allow him odds,
And meet him, were I tie[SEQ_SPLITTER]d to run afoot
Even to the frozen ridges of the Al[SEQ_SPLITTER]ps,
Or any other ground inhabitable,
Where ever En[SEQ_SPLITTER]glishman durst set his foot.
Mean time let this de[SEQ_SPLITTER]fend my loyalty,
By all my hopes, most falsely dot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h he lie.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Pale trembling cowar[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, there I throw my gage,
Disclaiming here the kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]dred of the king,
And lay aside my high blood's ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]yalty,
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to ex[SEQ_SPLITTER]cept.
If guilty dread have left thee so much stren[SEQ_SPLITTER]gth
As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
Will[SEQ_SPLITTER] I make good against thee, arm to arm,
What I have[SEQ_SPLITTER] spoke, or thou canst worse devise.

THOMAS MOWBRA[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y:
I take it up; and by that sword I swear
Which g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
I'll answ[SEQ_SPLITTER]er thee in any fair degree,
Or chivalrous design o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f knightly trial:
And when I mount, alive may I no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t light,
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!

KING [SEQ_SPLITTER]RICHARD II:
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's [SEQ_SPLITTER]charge?
It must be great that can inherit us
So mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch as of a thought of ill in him.

HENRY BOLINGBRO[SEQ_SPLITTER]KE:
Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it tru[SEQ_SPLITTER]e;
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand noble[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
Beside[SEQ_SPLITTER]s I say and will in battle prove,
Or here or elsew[SEQ_SPLITTER]here to the furthest verge
That ever was survey'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]by English eye,
That all the treasons for these ei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghteen years
Complotted and contrived in this land[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing.
Further I say and further will maintain
Upon [SEQ_SPLITTER]his bad life to make all this good,
That he did pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
Suggest his soo[SEQ_SPLITTER]n-believing adversaries,
And consequently, like a [SEQ_SPLITTER]traitor coward,
Sluiced out his innocent soul thro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ugh streams of blood:
Which blood, like sacrificin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g Abel's, cries,
Even from the tongueless caverns [SEQ_SPLITTER]of the earth,
To me for justice and rough chastise[SEQ_SPLITTER]ment;
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is arm shall do it, or this life be spent.

KING R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ICHARD II:
How high a pitch his resolution soars!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?

THOM[SEQ_SPLITTER]AS MOWBRAY:
O, let my sovereign turn away his face[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
Till I h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave told this slander of his blood,
How God and go[SEQ_SPLITTER]od men hate so foul a liar.

KING RICHARD II:
Mowb[SEQ_SPLITTER]ray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
Were he my b[SEQ_SPLITTER]rother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
As he is but my fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther's brother's son,
Now, by my sceptre's awe, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]make a vow,
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred [SEQ_SPLITTER]blood
Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
He is[SEQ_SPLITTER] our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
Free speech an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d fearless I to thee allow.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
Through the [SEQ_SPLITTER]false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
Three par[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts of that receipt I had for Calais
Disbursed I du[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly to his highness' soldiers;
The other part reser[SEQ_SPLITTER]ved I by consent,
For that my sovereign liege was [SEQ_SPLITTER]in my debt
Upon remainder of a dear account,
Since[SEQ_SPLITTER] last I went to France to fetch his queen:
Now swa[SEQ_SPLITTER]llow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
I slew[SEQ_SPLITTER] him not; but to my own disgrace
Neglected my swor[SEQ_SPLITTER]n duty in that case.
For you, my noble Lord of Lan[SEQ_SPLITTER]caster,
The honourable father to my foe
Once did I[SEQ_SPLITTER] lay an ambush for your life,
A trespass that doth[SEQ_SPLITTER] vex my grieved soul
But ere I last received the s[SEQ_SPLITTER]acrament
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
Your[SEQ_SPLITTER] grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
This is my f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ault: as for the rest appeall'd,
It issues from th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e rancour of a villain,
A recreant and most degene[SEQ_SPLITTER]rate traitor
Which in myself I boldly will defend;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Upon this o[SEQ_SPLITTER]verweening traitor's foot,
To prove myself a loyal[SEQ_SPLITTER] gentleman
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his[SEQ_SPLITTER] bosom.
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
You[SEQ_SPLITTER]r highness to assign our trial day.

KING RICHARD [SEQ_SPLITTER]II:
Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
Let's[SEQ_SPLITTER] purge this choler without letting blood:
This we [SEQ_SPLITTER]prescribe, though no physician;
Deep malice makes [SEQ_SPLITTER]too deep incision;
Forget, forgive; conclude and b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e agreed;
Our doctors say this is no month to blee[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.
Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
We'll [SEQ_SPLITTER]calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.

JOHN OF G[SEQ_SPLITTER]AUNT:
To be a make-peace shall become my age:
Thro[SEQ_SPLITTER]w down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.

KING [SEQ_SPLITTER]RICHARD II:
And, Norfolk, throw down his.

JOHN OF[SEQ_SPLITTER] GAUNT:
When, Harry, when?
Obedience bids I should[SEQ_SPLITTER] not bid again.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, throw d[SEQ_SPLITTER]own, we bid; there is no boot.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
My[SEQ_SPLITTER]self I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
My lif[SEQ_SPLITTER]e thou shalt command, but not my shame:
The one my[SEQ_SPLITTER] duty owes; but my fair name,
Despite of death tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t lives upon my grave,
To dark dishonour's use tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u shalt not have.
I am disgraced, impeach'd and ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]ffled here,
Pierced to the soul with slander's ven[SEQ_SPLITTER]om'd spear,
The which no balm can cure but his hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt-blood
Which breathed this poison.

KING RICHARD[SEQ_SPLITTER] II:
Rage must be withstood:
Give me his gage: lio[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns make leopards tame.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Yea, but n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot change his spots: take but my shame.
And I resi[SEQ_SPLITTER]gn my gage. My dear dear lord,
The purest treasure[SEQ_SPLITTER] mortal times afford
Is spotless reputation: that [SEQ_SPLITTER]away,
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
A j[SEQ_SPLITTER]ewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
Is a bold spir[SEQ_SPLITTER]it in a loyal breast.
Mine honour is my life; both[SEQ_SPLITTER] grow in one:
Take honour from me, and my life is [SEQ_SPLITTER]done:
Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
In that I live and for that will I die.

KING RIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]HARD II:
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, God defend my soul from su[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch deep sin!
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's sight?
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my hei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
Or so[SEQ_SPLITTER]und so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
The slavi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh motive of recanting fear,
And spit it bleeding [SEQ_SPLITTER]in his high disgrace,
Where shame doth harbour, ev[SEQ_SPLITTER]en in Mowbray's face.

KING RICHARD II:
We were no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t born to sue, but to command;
Which since we cann[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot do to make you friends,
Be ready, as your lives[SEQ_SPLITTER] shall answer it,
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s day:
There shall your swords and lances arbitrat[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
The swelling difference of your settled hate:
Si[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce we can not atone you, we shall see
Justice des[SEQ_SPLITTER]ign the victor's chivalry.
Lord marshal, command o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur officers at arms
Be ready to direct these home [SEQ_SPLITTER]alarms.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Alas, the part I had in Wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]odstock's blood
Doth more solicit me than your exc[SEQ_SPLITTER]laims,
To stir against the butchers of his life!
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut since correction lieth in those hands
Which mad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e the fault that we cannot correct,
Put we our qua[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrel to the will of heaven;
Who, when they see the[SEQ_SPLITTER] hours ripe on earth,
Will rain hot vengeance on o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ffenders' heads.

DUCHESS:
Finds brotherhood in th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee no sharper spur?
Hath love in thy old blood no [SEQ_SPLITTER]living fire?
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself [SEQ_SPLITTER]art one,
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
So[SEQ_SPLITTER]me of those seven are dried by nature's course,
So[SEQ_SPLITTER]me of those branches by the Destinies cut;
But Tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]mas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
One via[SEQ_SPLITTER]l full of Edward's sacred blood,
One flourishing b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ranch of his most royal root,
Is crack'd, and all [SEQ_SPLITTER]the precious liquor spilt,
Is hack'd down, and his[SEQ_SPLITTER] summer leaves all faded,
By envy's hand and murde[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's bloody axe.
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at bed, that womb,
That metal, that self-mould, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at fashion'd thee
Made him a man; and though thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]livest and breathest,
Yet art thou slain in him: t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou dost consent
In some large measure to thy fath[SEQ_SPLITTER]er's death,
In that thou seest thy wretched brothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r die,
Who was the model of thy father's life.
Cal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
In suffer[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
Thou showe[SEQ_SPLITTER]st the naked pathway to thy life,
Teaching stern m[SEQ_SPLITTER]urder how to butcher thee:
That which in mean men [SEQ_SPLITTER]we intitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in nobl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e breasts.
What shall I say? to safeguard thine ow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n life,
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eath.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God's is the quarrel; for Go[SEQ_SPLITTER]d's substitute,
His deputy anointed in His sight,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
Le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t heaven revenge; for I may never lift
An angry ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]m against His minister.

DUCHESS:
Where then, alas[SEQ_SPLITTER], may I complain myself?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
To God, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he widow's champion and defence.

DUCHESS:
Why, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]en, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
Thou goest to Cov[SEQ_SPLITTER]entry, there to behold
Our cousin Hereford and fel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l Mowbray fight:
O, sit my husband's wrongs on Her[SEQ_SPLITTER]eford's spear,
That it may enter butcher Mowbray's[SEQ_SPLITTER] breast!
Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
They may [SEQ_SPLITTER]break his foaming courser's back,
And throw the ri[SEQ_SPLITTER]der headlong in the lists,
A caitiff recreant to m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y cousin Hereford!
Farewell, old Gaunt: thy someti[SEQ_SPLITTER]mes brother's wife
With her companion grief must e[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd her life.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Sister, farewell; I m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust to Coventry:
As much good stay with thee as go[SEQ_SPLITTER] with me!

DUCHESS:
Yet one word more: grief bound[SEQ_SPLITTER]eth where it falls,
Not with the empty hollowness,[SEQ_SPLITTER] but weight:
I take my leave before I have begun,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
Commend [SEQ_SPLITTER]me to thy brother, Edmund York.
Lo, this is all:--[SEQ_SPLITTER]nay, yet depart not so;
Though this be all, do not[SEQ_SPLITTER] so quickly go;
I shall remember more. Bid him--ah[SEQ_SPLITTER], what?--
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Alack, and what shall good old York there see
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
Unpeopled of[SEQ_SPLITTER]fices, untrodden stones?
And what hear there for w[SEQ_SPLITTER]elcome but my groans?
Therefore commend me; let hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m not come there,
To seek out sorrow that dwells e[SEQ_SPLITTER]very where.
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ie:
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Lord Marshal:
My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford a[SEQ_SPLITTER]rm'd?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, at all points; and lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngs to enter in.

Lord Marshal:
The Duke of Norfol[SEQ_SPLITTER]k, sprightfully and bold,
Stays but the summons of[SEQ_SPLITTER] the appellant's trumpet.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Why, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen, the champions are prepared, and stay
For noth[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing but his majesty's approach.

KING RICHARD II:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Marshal, demand of yonder champion
The cause of hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s arrival here in arms:
Ask him his name and order[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly proceed
To swear him in the justice of his caus[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

Lord Marshal:
In God's name and the king's, sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y who thou art
And why thou comest thus knightly c[SEQ_SPLITTER]lad in arms,
Against what man thou comest, and wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thy quarrel:
Speak truly, on thy knighthood and [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy oath;
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour![SEQ_SPLITTER]

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke [SEQ_SPLITTER]of Norfolk;
Who hither come engaged by my oath--
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hich God defend a knight should violate!--
Both to[SEQ_SPLITTER] defend my loyalty and truth
To God, my king and m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y succeeding issue,
Against the Duke of Hereford t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat appeals me
And, by the grace of God and this m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ine arm,
To prove him, in defending of myself,
A t[SEQ_SPLITTER]raitor to my God, my king, and me:
And as I truly [SEQ_SPLITTER]fight, defend me heaven!

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal[SEQ_SPLITTER], ask yonder knight in arms,
Both who he is and wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]y he cometh hither
Thus plated in habiliments of w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar,
And formally, according to our law,
Depose him[SEQ_SPLITTER] in the justice of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
What [SEQ_SPLITTER]is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,
Bef[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore King Richard in his royal lists?
Against whom [SEQ_SPLITTER]comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
Speak like a [SEQ_SPLITTER]true knight, so defend thee heaven!

HENRY BOLINGB[SEQ_SPLITTER]ROKE:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby
Am I;[SEQ_SPLITTER] who ready here do stand in arms,
To prove, by God[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s grace and my body's valour,
In lists, on Thomas[SEQ_SPLITTER] Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
That he is a traitor, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]oul and dangerous,
To God of heaven, King Richard [SEQ_SPLITTER]and to me;
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven![SEQ_SPLITTER]

Lord Marshal:
On pain of death, no person be so [SEQ_SPLITTER]bold
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
Except[SEQ_SPLITTER] the marshal and such officers
Appointed to direct[SEQ_SPLITTER] these fair designs.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lord mars[SEQ_SPLITTER]hal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
And bow my k[SEQ_SPLITTER]nee before his majesty:
For Mowbray and myself are[SEQ_SPLITTER] like two men
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage[SEQ_SPLITTER];
Then let us take a ceremonious leave
And loving [SEQ_SPLITTER]farewell of our several friends.

Lord Marshal:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e appellant in all duty greets your highness,
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.

KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] RICHARD II:
We will descend and fold him in our a[SEQ_SPLITTER]rms.
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
So[SEQ_SPLITTER] be thy fortune in this royal fight!
Farewell, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]blood; which if to-day thou shed,
Lament we may, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut not revenge thee dead.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t no noble eye profane a tear
For me, if I be gore[SEQ_SPLITTER]d with Mowbray's spear:
As confident as is the fal[SEQ_SPLITTER]con's flight
Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fig[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht.
My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
Of you[SEQ_SPLITTER], my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
Not sick, althoug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h I have to do with death,
But lusty, young, and c[SEQ_SPLITTER]heerly drawing breath.
Lo, as at English feasts, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o I regreet
The daintiest last, to make the end mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]st sweet:
O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
Doth with[SEQ_SPLITTER] a twofold vigour lift me up
To reach at victory a[SEQ_SPLITTER]bove my head,
Add proof unto mine armour with thy [SEQ_SPLITTER]prayers;
And with thy blessings steel my lance's p[SEQ_SPLITTER]oint,
That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,
Even in the [SEQ_SPLITTER]lusty havior of his son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God in th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y good cause make thee prosperous!
Be swift like l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ightning in the execution;
And let thy blows, doub[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly redoubled,
Fall like amazing thunder on the cas[SEQ_SPLITTER]que
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
Rouse up thy [SEQ_SPLITTER]youthful blood, be valiant and live.

HENRY BOLING[SEQ_SPLITTER]BROKE:
Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
THOMAS MOWBRAY:
However God or fortune cast my lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]t,
There lives or dies, true to King Richard's thr[SEQ_SPLITTER]one,
A loyal, just and upright gentleman:
Never di[SEQ_SPLITTER]d captive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f bondage and embrace
His golden uncontroll'd enfr[SEQ_SPLITTER]anchisement,
More than my dancing soul doth celebr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate
This feast of battle with mine adversary.
Most[SEQ_SPLITTER] mighty liege, and my companion peers,
Take from m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y mouth the wish of happy years:
As gentle and as [SEQ_SPLITTER]jocund as to jest
Go I to fight: truth hath a quie[SEQ_SPLITTER]t breast.

KING RICHARD II:
Farewell, my lord: sec[SEQ_SPLITTER]urely I espy
Virtue with valour couched in thine e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ye.
Order the trial, marshal, and begin.

Lord Mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]shal:
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
Rece[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive thy lance; and God defend the right!

HENRY BO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LINGBROKE:
Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Lord Marshal:
Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke [SEQ_SPLITTER]of Norfolk.

First Herald:
Harry of Hereford, Lanc[SEQ_SPLITTER]aster and Derby,
Stands here for God, his sovereig[SEQ_SPLITTER]n and himself,
On pain to be found false and recre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ant,
To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
A traitor to his God, his king and him;
And dares[SEQ_SPLITTER] him to set forward to the fight.

Second Herald:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
On [SEQ_SPLITTER]pain to be found false and recreant,
Both to defen[SEQ_SPLITTER]d himself and to approve
Henry of Hereford, Lancas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter, and Derby,
To God, his sovereign and to him d[SEQ_SPLITTER]isloyal;
Courageously and with a free desire
Atten[SEQ_SPLITTER]ding but the signal to begin.

Lord Marshal:
Sound[SEQ_SPLITTER], trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
Stay, the[SEQ_SPLITTER] king hath thrown his warder down.

KING RICHARD I[SEQ_SPLITTER]I:
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And both return back to their chairs again:
Withd[SEQ_SPLITTER]raw with us: and let the trumpets sound
While we r[SEQ_SPLITTER]eturn these dukes what we decree.
Draw near,
And l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ist what with our council we have done.
For that o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
With that [SEQ_SPLITTER]dear blood which it hath fostered;
And for our eye[SEQ_SPLITTER]s do hate the dire aspect
Of civil wounds plough'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] up with neighbours' sword;
And for we think the e[SEQ_SPLITTER]agle-winged pride
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious th[SEQ_SPLITTER]oughts,
With rival-hating envy, set on you
To wake[SEQ_SPLITTER] our peace, which in our country's cradle
Draws th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
Which so ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]used up with boisterous untuned drums,
With harsh [SEQ_SPLITTER]resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
And grating sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ock of wrathful iron arms,
Might from our quiet co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nfines fright fair peace
And make us wade even in [SEQ_SPLITTER]our kindred's blood,
Therefore, we banish you our [SEQ_SPLITTER]territories:
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of li[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe,
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fiel[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
But tread[SEQ_SPLITTER] the stranger paths of banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBR[SEQ_SPLITTER]OKE:
Your will be done: this must my comfort be,
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]un that warms you here shall shine on me;
And thos[SEQ_SPLITTER]e his golden beams to you here lent
Shall point on[SEQ_SPLITTER] me and gild my banishment.

KING RICHARD II:
Norf[SEQ_SPLITTER]olk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
Which I with[SEQ_SPLITTER] some unwillingness pronounce:
The sly slow hours [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall not determinate
The dateless limit of thy de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar exile;
The hopeless word of 'never to return'
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]reathe I against thee, upon pain of life.

THOMAS [SEQ_SPLITTER]MOWBRAY:
A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege[SEQ_SPLITTER],
And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
As to be cast f[SEQ_SPLITTER]orth in the common air,
Have I deserved at your hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghness' hands.
The language I have learn'd these f[SEQ_SPLITTER]orty years,
My native English, now I must forego:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And now my tongue's use is to me no more
Than an u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nstringed viol or a harp,
Or like a cunning instru[SEQ_SPLITTER]ment cased up,
Or, being open, put into his hands
[SEQ_SPLITTER]That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
Within my[SEQ_SPLITTER] mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
Doubly portcul[SEQ_SPLITTER]lis'd with my teeth and lips;
And dull unfeeling b[SEQ_SPLITTER]arren ignorance
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
Too far in yea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs to be a pupil now:
What is thy sentence then bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t speechless death,
Which robs my tongue from brea[SEQ_SPLITTER]thing native breath?

KING RICHARD II:
It boots th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee not to be compassionate:
After our sentence pla[SEQ_SPLITTER]ining comes too late.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then thus I[SEQ_SPLITTER] turn me from my country's light,
To dwell in sole[SEQ_SPLITTER]mn shades of endless night.

KING RICHARD II:
Retu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rn again, and take an oath with thee.
Lay on our r[SEQ_SPLITTER]oyal sword your banish'd hands;
Swear by the duty [SEQ_SPLITTER]that you owe to God--
Our part therein we banish w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith yourselves--
To keep the oath that we administ[SEQ_SPLITTER]er:
You never shall, so help you truth and God!
Em[SEQ_SPLITTER]brace each other's love in banishment;
Nor never l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ook upon each other's face;
Nor never write, regre[SEQ_SPLITTER]et, nor reconcile
This louring tempest of your hom[SEQ_SPLITTER]e-bred hate;
Nor never by advised purpose meet
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]plot, contrive, or complot any ill
'Gainst us, our[SEQ_SPLITTER] state, our subjects, or our land.

HENRY BOLINGBR[SEQ_SPLITTER]OKE:
I swear.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
And I, to keep all [SEQ_SPLITTER]this.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Norfolk, so far as to mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne enemy:--
By this time, had the king permitted u[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
One of our souls had wander'd in the air.
Banis[SEQ_SPLITTER]h'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,
As now our [SEQ_SPLITTER]flesh is banish'd from this land:
Confess thy trea[SEQ_SPLITTER]sons ere thou fly the realm;
Since thou hast far t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o go, bear not along
The clogging burthen of a gui[SEQ_SPLITTER]lty soul.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
No, Bolingbroke: if eve[SEQ_SPLITTER]r I were traitor,
My name be blotted from the book[SEQ_SPLITTER] of life,
And I from heaven banish'd as from hence[SEQ_SPLITTER]!
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
Farewel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
Save back to [SEQ_SPLITTER]England, all the world's my way.

KING RICHARD II:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
I see th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y grieved heart: thy sad aspect
Hath from the numb[SEQ_SPLITTER]er of his banish'd years
Pluck'd four away.
Six fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ozen winter spent,
Return with welcome home from b[SEQ_SPLITTER]anishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How long a time lie[SEQ_SPLITTER]s in one little word!
Four lagging winters and fou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r wanton springs
End in a word: such is the breath[SEQ_SPLITTER] of kings.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I thank my liege, that [SEQ_SPLITTER]in regard of me
He shortens four years of my son's[SEQ_SPLITTER] exile:
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or, ere the six years that he hath to spend
Can ch[SEQ_SPLITTER]ange their moons and bring their times about
My oi[SEQ_SPLITTER]l-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
Shall be exti[SEQ_SPLITTER]nct with age and endless night;
My inch of taper w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill be burnt and done,
And blindfold death not let[SEQ_SPLITTER] me see my son.

KING RICHARD II:
Why uncle, thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]hast many years to live.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
But not a[SEQ_SPLITTER] minute, king, that thou canst give:
Shorten my da[SEQ_SPLITTER]ys thou canst with sullen sorrow,
And pluck nights[SEQ_SPLITTER] from me, but not lend a morrow;
Thou canst help t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ime to furrow me with age,
But stop no wrinkle in [SEQ_SPLITTER]his pilgrimage;
Thy word is current with him for m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y death,
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h.

KING RICHARD II:
Thy son is banish'd upon good[SEQ_SPLITTER] advice,
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?

JOH[SEQ_SPLITTER]N OF GAUNT:
Things sweet to taste prove in digesti[SEQ_SPLITTER]on sour.
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather[SEQ_SPLITTER]
You would have bid me argue like a father.
O, had[SEQ_SPLITTER] it been a stranger, not my child,
To smooth his f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ault I should have been more mild:
A partial sland[SEQ_SPLITTER]er sought I to avoid,
And in the sentence my own l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ife destroy'd.
Alas, I look'd when some of you sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld say,
I was too strict to make mine own away;
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
Against m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y will to do myself this wrong.

KING RICHARD II:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:
Six year[SEQ_SPLITTER]s we banish him, and he shall go.

DUKE OF AUMERLE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom where you do remain let paper show.

Lord Mars[SEQ_SPLITTER]hal:
My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
As[SEQ_SPLITTER] far as land will let me, by your side.

JOHN OF G[SEQ_SPLITTER]AUNT:
O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words[SEQ_SPLITTER],
That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I have too few to take my leav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of you,
When the tongue's office should be prodi[SEQ_SPLITTER]gal
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]JOHN OF GAUNT:
Thy grief is but thy absence for a [SEQ_SPLITTER]time.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Joy absent, grief is pre[SEQ_SPLITTER]sent for that time.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
What is six wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nters? they are quickly gone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.

JOHN[SEQ_SPLITTER] OF GAUNT:
Call it a travel that thou takest for p[SEQ_SPLITTER]leasure.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My heart will sigh wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]en I miscall it so,
Which finds it an inforced pil[SEQ_SPLITTER]grimage.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
The sullen passage of thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] weary steps
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to se[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
The precious jewel of thy home return.

HENRY BO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LINGBROKE:
Nay, rather, every tedious stride I mak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Will but remember me what a deal of world
I wand[SEQ_SPLITTER]er from the jewels that I love.
Must I not serve a[SEQ_SPLITTER] long apprenticehood
To foreign passages, and in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he end,
Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut that I was a journeyman to grief?

JOHN OF GAUN[SEQ_SPLITTER]T:
All places that the eye of heaven visits
Are to[SEQ_SPLITTER] a wise man ports and happy havens.
Teach thy nece[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssity to reason thus;
There is no virtue like nece[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssity.
Think not the king did banish thee,
But tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,
Where it per[SEQ_SPLITTER]ceives it is but faintly borne.
Go, say I sent the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e forth to purchase honour
And not the king exiled[SEQ_SPLITTER] thee; or suppose
Devouring pestilence hangs in ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r air
And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
Look[SEQ_SPLITTER], what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
To lie that[SEQ_SPLITTER] way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:
Suppose t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he singing birds musicians,
The grass whereon thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] tread'st the presence strew'd,
The flowers fair l[SEQ_SPLITTER]adies, and thy steps no more
Than a delightful mea[SEQ_SPLITTER]sure or a dance;
For gnarling sorrow hath less pow[SEQ_SPLITTER]er to bite
The man that mocks at it and sets it li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, who can hold a fire in[SEQ_SPLITTER] his hand
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
Or c[SEQ_SPLITTER]loy the hungry edge of appetite
By bare imaginatio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n of a feast?
Or wallow naked in December snow
By [SEQ_SPLITTER]thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
O, no! the ap[SEQ_SPLITTER]prehension of the good
Gives but the greater feeli[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng to the worse:
Fell sorrow's tooth doth never ra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nkle more
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the [SEQ_SPLITTER]sore.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Come, come, my son, I'll bri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng thee on thy way:
Had I thy youth and cause, I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould not stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Then, England's[SEQ_SPLITTER] ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
My mother, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd my nurse, that bears me yet!
Where'er I wander,[SEQ_SPLITTER] boast of this I can,
Though banish'd, yet a trueb[SEQ_SPLITTER]orn Englishman.

KING RICHARD II:
We did observe. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Cousin Aumerle,
How far brought you high Hereford [SEQ_SPLITTER]on his way?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I brought high Heref[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord, if you call him so,
But to the next highway, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and there I left him.

KING RICHARD II:
And say, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat store of parting tears were shed?

DUKE OF AUM[SEQ_SPLITTER]ERLE:
Faith, none for me; except the north-east wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd,
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
Aw[SEQ_SPLITTER]aked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
Did grac[SEQ_SPLITTER]e our hollow parting with a tear.

KING RICHARD II[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
What said our cousin when you parted with him?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]DUKE OF AUMERLE:
'Farewell:'
And, for my heart dis[SEQ_SPLITTER]dained that my tongue
Should so profane the word, [SEQ_SPLITTER]that taught me craft
To counterfeit oppression of [SEQ_SPLITTER]such grief
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's[SEQ_SPLITTER] grave.
Marry, would the word 'farewell' have leng[SEQ_SPLITTER]then'd hours
And added years to his short banishme[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt,
He should have had a volume of farewells;
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]since it would not, he had none of me.

KING RICHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD II:
He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen time shall call him home from banishment,
Whet[SEQ_SPLITTER]her our kinsman come to see his friends.
Ourself a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd Bushy, Bagot here and Green
Observed his courts[SEQ_SPLITTER]hip to the common people;
How he did seem to dive [SEQ_SPLITTER]into their hearts
With humble and familiar courtes[SEQ_SPLITTER]y,
What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
Woo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
And pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]tient underbearing of his fortune,
As 'twere to ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]nish their affects with him.
Off goes his bonnet t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o an oyster-wench;
A brace of draymen bid God spee[SEQ_SPLITTER]d him well
And had the tribute of his supple knee,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
[SEQ_SPLITTER]As were our England in reversion his,
And he our s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ubjects' next degree in hope.

GREEN:
Well, he is [SEQ_SPLITTER]gone; and with him go these thoughts.
Now for the [SEQ_SPLITTER]rebels which stand out in Ireland,
Expedient manag[SEQ_SPLITTER]e must be made, my liege,
Ere further leisure yiel[SEQ_SPLITTER]d them further means
For their advantage and your [SEQ_SPLITTER]highness' loss.

KING RICHARD II:
We will ourself [SEQ_SPLITTER]in person to this war:
And, for our coffers, with [SEQ_SPLITTER]too great a court
And liberal largess, are grown s[SEQ_SPLITTER]omewhat light,
We are inforced to farm our royal r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ealm;
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
For our[SEQ_SPLITTER] affairs in hand: if that come short,
Our substitu[SEQ_SPLITTER]tes at home shall have blank charters;
Whereto, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]en they shall know what men are rich,
They shall s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ubscribe them for large sums of gold
And send them[SEQ_SPLITTER] after to supply our wants;
For we will make for I[SEQ_SPLITTER]reland presently.
Bushy, what news?

BUSHY:
Old Jo[SEQ_SPLITTER]hn of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
Suddenly ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]ken; and hath sent post haste
To entreat your maje[SEQ_SPLITTER]sty to visit him.

KING RICHARD II:
Where lies he?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

BUSHY:
At Ely House.

KING RICHARD II:
Now put i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, God, in the physician's mind
To help him to his[SEQ_SPLITTER] grave immediately!
The lining of his coffers shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l make coats
To deck our soldiers for these Irish [SEQ_SPLITTER]wars.
Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
Pra[SEQ_SPLITTER]y God we may make haste, and come too late!

All:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Amen.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Will the king come, that I m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay breathe my last
In wholesome counsel to his uns[SEQ_SPLITTER]taid youth?

DUKE OF YORK:
Vex not yourself, nor s[SEQ_SPLITTER]trive not with your breath;
For all in vain comes [SEQ_SPLITTER]counsel to his ear.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, but they sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y the tongues of dying men
Enforce attention like [SEQ_SPLITTER]deep harmony:
Where words are scarce, they are sel[SEQ_SPLITTER]dom spent in vain,
For they breathe truth that bre[SEQ_SPLITTER]athe their words in pain.
He that no more must say[SEQ_SPLITTER] is listen'd more
Than they whom youth and ease ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve taught to glose;
More are men's ends mark'd tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n their lives before:
The setting sun, and music a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the close,
As the last taste of sweets, is sweet[SEQ_SPLITTER]est last,
Writ in remembrance more than things lon[SEQ_SPLITTER]g past:
Though Richard my life's counsel would not[SEQ_SPLITTER] hear,
My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

DUKE OF YORK:
No; it is stopp'd with other flatt[SEQ_SPLITTER]ering sounds,
As praises, of whose taste the wise [SEQ_SPLITTER]are fond,
Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
[SEQ_SPLITTER]The open ear of youth doth always listen;
Report o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f fashions in proud Italy,
Whose manners still our[SEQ_SPLITTER] tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
So i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t be new, there's no respect how vile--
That is no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t quickly buzzed into his ears?
Then all too late [SEQ_SPLITTER]comes counsel to be heard,
Where will doth mutiny [SEQ_SPLITTER]with wit's regard.
Direct not him whose way himsel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f will choose:
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that [SEQ_SPLITTER]breath wilt thou lose.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Methinks I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am a prophet new inspired
And thus expiring do for[SEQ_SPLITTER]etell of him:
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot[SEQ_SPLITTER] last,
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ort;
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
Li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght vanity, insatiate cormorant,
Consuming means, [SEQ_SPLITTER]soon preys upon itself.
This royal throne of kings[SEQ_SPLITTER], this scepter'd isle,
This earth of majesty, this[SEQ_SPLITTER] seat of Mars,
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
Thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s fortress built by Nature for herself
Against inf[SEQ_SPLITTER]ection and the hand of war,
This happy breed of me[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, this little world,
This precious stone set in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a [SEQ_SPLITTER]wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he envy of less happier lands,
This blessed plot, [SEQ_SPLITTER]this earth, this realm, this England,
This nurse, [SEQ_SPLITTER]this teeming womb of royal kings,
Fear'd by their [SEQ_SPLITTER]breed and famous by their birth,
Renowned for thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r deeds as far from home,
For Christian service an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d true chivalry,
As is the sepulchre in stubborn J[SEQ_SPLITTER]ewry,
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]his land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Dear for her reputation through the world,
Is now [SEQ_SPLITTER]leased out, I die pronouncing it,
Like to a teneme[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt or pelting farm:
England, bound in with the tri[SEQ_SPLITTER]umphant sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the envio[SEQ_SPLITTER]us siege
Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hame,
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]That England, that was wont to conquer others,
Hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h made a shameful conquest of itself.
Ah, would th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e scandal vanish with my life,
How happy then were[SEQ_SPLITTER] my ensuing death!

DUKE OF YORK:
The king is come[SEQ_SPLITTER]: deal mildly with his youth;
For young hot colts [SEQ_SPLITTER]being raged do rage the more.

QUEEN:
How fares ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r noble uncle, Lancaster?

KING RICHARD II:
What c[SEQ_SPLITTER]omfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?

JOHN OF GA[SEQ_SPLITTER]UNT:
O how that name befits my composition!
Old Ga[SEQ_SPLITTER]unt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
Within me grie[SEQ_SPLITTER]f hath kept a tedious fast;
And who abstains from [SEQ_SPLITTER]meat that is not gaunt?
For sleeping England long [SEQ_SPLITTER]time have I watch'd;
Watching breeds leanness, lea[SEQ_SPLITTER]nness is all gaunt:
The pleasure that some fathers[SEQ_SPLITTER] feed upon,
Is my strict fast; I mean, my children[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s looks;
And therein fasting, hast thou made me g[SEQ_SPLITTER]aunt:
Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.

KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] RICHARD II:
Can sick men play so nicely with thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r names?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, misery makes sport to[SEQ_SPLITTER] mock itself:
Since thou dost seek to kill my name[SEQ_SPLITTER] in me,
I mock my name, great king, to flatter the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

KING RICHARD II:
Should dying men flatter with[SEQ_SPLITTER] those that live?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, no, men livi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng flatter those that die.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou,[SEQ_SPLITTER] now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.

JOHN OF [SEQ_SPLITTER]GAUNT:
O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
KING RICHARD II:
I am in health, I breathe, and s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee thee ill.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Now He that made me k[SEQ_SPLITTER]nows I see thee ill;
Ill in myself to see, and in [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee seeing ill.
Thy death-bed is no lesser than t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy land
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou, too careless patient as thou art,
Commit'st[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy anointed body to the cure
Of those physicians[SEQ_SPLITTER] that first wounded thee:
A thousand flatterers si[SEQ_SPLITTER]t within thy crown,
Whose compass is no bigger tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n thy head;
And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.
O, had [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
Seen how his so[SEQ_SPLITTER]n's son should destroy his sons,
From forth thy re[SEQ_SPLITTER]ach he would have laid thy shame,
Deposing thee be[SEQ_SPLITTER]fore thou wert possess'd,
Which art possess'd now [SEQ_SPLITTER]to depose thyself.
Why, cousin, wert thou regent o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f the world,
It were a shame to let this land by l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ease;
But for thy world enjoying but this land,
Is[SEQ_SPLITTER] it not more than shame to shame it so?
Landlord o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f England art thou now, not king:
Thy state of law[SEQ_SPLITTER] is bondslave to the law; And thou--

KING RICHARD[SEQ_SPLITTER] II:
A lunatic lean-witted fool,
Presuming on an a[SEQ_SPLITTER]gue's privilege,
Darest with thy frozen admonition[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
With[SEQ_SPLITTER] fury from his native residence.
Now, by my seat's[SEQ_SPLITTER] right royal majesty,
Wert thou not brother to gre[SEQ_SPLITTER]at Edward's son,
This tongue that runs so roundly [SEQ_SPLITTER]in thy head
Should run thy head from thy unreveren[SEQ_SPLITTER]t shoulders.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, spare me not, my b[SEQ_SPLITTER]rother Edward's son,
For that I was his father Edw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard's son;
That blood already, like the pelican,
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
My bro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
Whom fai[SEQ_SPLITTER]r befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!
May be a pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ecedent and witness good
That thou respect'st not [SEQ_SPLITTER]spilling Edward's blood:
Join with the present sic[SEQ_SPLITTER]kness that I have;
And thy unkindness be like croo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ked age,
To crop at once a too long wither'd flowe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r.
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee![SEQ_SPLITTER]
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
Convey m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to my bed, then to my grave:
Love they to live t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat love and honour have.

KING RICHARD II:
And le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t them die that age and sullens have;
For both has[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thou, and both become the grave.

DUKE OF YORK:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I do beseech your majesty, impute his words
To way[SEQ_SPLITTER]ward sickliness and age in him:
He loves you, on m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y life, and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of Herefo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd, were he here.

KING RICHARD II:
Right, you say[SEQ_SPLITTER] true: as Hereford's love, so his;
As theirs, so m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ine; and all be as it is.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lieg[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.

KING R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ICHARD II:
What says he?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, not[SEQ_SPLITTER]hing; all is said
His tongue is now a stringless i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nstrument;
Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath[SEQ_SPLITTER] spent.

DUKE OF YORK:
Be York the next that must [SEQ_SPLITTER]be bankrupt so!
Though death be poor, it ends a mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtal woe.

KING RICHARD II:
The ripest fruit first[SEQ_SPLITTER] falls, and so doth he;
His time is spent, our pil[SEQ_SPLITTER]grimage must be.
So much for that. Now for our Iri[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh wars:
We must supplant those rough rug-headed k[SEQ_SPLITTER]erns,
Which live like venom where no venom else
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t only they have privilege to live.
And for these [SEQ_SPLITTER]great affairs do ask some charge,
Towards our assi[SEQ_SPLITTER]stance we do seize to us
The plate, corn, revenues[SEQ_SPLITTER] and moveables,
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand [SEQ_SPLITTER]possess'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
How long shall I be pati[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent? ah, how long
Shall tender duty make me suffer[SEQ_SPLITTER] wrong?
Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's ban[SEQ_SPLITTER]ishment
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private[SEQ_SPLITTER] wrongs,
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
Ab[SEQ_SPLITTER]out his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
Have ever m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ade me sour my patient cheek,
Or bend one wrinkle [SEQ_SPLITTER]on my sovereign's face.
I am the last of noble Edw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard's sons,
Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]as first:
In war was never lion raged more fierce,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
Than wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s that young and princely gentleman.
His face thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] hast, for even so look'd he,
Accomplish'd with th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e number of thy hours;
But when he frown'd, it was[SEQ_SPLITTER] against the French
And not against his friends; h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is noble hand
Did will what he did spend and spent[SEQ_SPLITTER] not that
Which his triumphant father's hand had w[SEQ_SPLITTER]on;
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] bloody with the enemies of his kin.
O Richard! Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rk is too far gone with grief,
Or else he never wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld compare between.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, uncle,[SEQ_SPLITTER] what's the matter?

DUKE OF YORK:
O my liege,
Par[SEQ_SPLITTER]don me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
Not to b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e pardon'd, am content withal.
Seek you to seize a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd gripe into your hands
The royalties and rights [SEQ_SPLITTER]of banish'd Hereford?
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth [SEQ_SPLITTER]not Hereford live?
Was not Gaunt just, and is not [SEQ_SPLITTER]Harry true?
Did not the one deserve to have an hei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r?
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Take Here[SEQ_SPLITTER]ford's rights away, and take from Time
His charter[SEQ_SPLITTER]s and his customary rights;
Let not to-morrow then[SEQ_SPLITTER] ensue to-day;
Be not thyself; for how art thou a [SEQ_SPLITTER]king
But by fair sequence and succession?
Now, afo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re God--God forbid I say true!--
If you do wrongfu[SEQ_SPLITTER]lly seize Hereford's rights,
Call in the letters p[SEQ_SPLITTER]atent that he hath
By his attorneys-general to sue[SEQ_SPLITTER]
His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
You pluc[SEQ_SPLITTER]k a thousand dangers on your head,
You lose a thou[SEQ_SPLITTER]sand well-disposed hearts
And prick my tender pati[SEQ_SPLITTER]ence, to those thoughts
Which honour and allegianc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e cannot think.

KING RICHARD II:
Think what you w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill, we seize into our hands
His plate, his goods,[SEQ_SPLITTER] his money and his lands.

DUKE OF YORK:
I'll not [SEQ_SPLITTER]be by the while: my liege, farewell:
What will ens[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue hereof, there's none can tell;
But by bad cours[SEQ_SPLITTER]es may be understood
That their events can never f[SEQ_SPLITTER]all out good.

KING RICHARD II:
Go, Bushy, to the [SEQ_SPLITTER]Earl of Wiltshire straight:
Bid him repair to us t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o Ely House
To see this business. To-morrow next
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]e will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:
And we [SEQ_SPLITTER]create, in absence of ourself,
Our uncle York lord[SEQ_SPLITTER] governor of England;
For he is just and always lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ved us well.
Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we[SEQ_SPLITTER] part;
Be merry, for our time of stay is short

NO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RTHUMBERLAND:
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s dead.

LORD ROSS:
And living too; for now his so[SEQ_SPLITTER]n is duke.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Barely in title, not [SEQ_SPLITTER]in revenue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if ju[SEQ_SPLITTER]stice had her right.

LORD ROSS:
My heart is great[SEQ_SPLITTER]; but it must break with silence,
Ere't be disburd[SEQ_SPLITTER]en'd with a liberal tongue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Nay, [SEQ_SPLITTER]speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]speaks thy words again to do thee harm!

LORD WILL[SEQ_SPLITTER]OUGHBY:
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke [SEQ_SPLITTER]of Hereford?
If it be so, out with it boldly, man;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.

L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORD ROSS:
No good at all that I can do for him;
Un[SEQ_SPLITTER]less you call it good to pity him,
Bereft and geld[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed of his patrimony.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Now, afore G[SEQ_SPLITTER]od, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
In him, a roy[SEQ_SPLITTER]al prince, and many moe
Of noble blood in this dec[SEQ_SPLITTER]lining land.
The king is not himself, but basely l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed
By flatterers; and what they will inform,
Merel[SEQ_SPLITTER]y in hate, 'gainst any of us all,
That will the ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng severely prosecute
'Gainst us, our lives, our c[SEQ_SPLITTER]hildren, and our heirs.

LORD ROSS:
The commons ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th he pill'd with grievous taxes,
And quite lost t[SEQ_SPLITTER]heir hearts: the nobles hath he fined
For ancient [SEQ_SPLITTER]quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.

LORD WILLO[SEQ_SPLITTER]UGHBY:
And daily new exactions are devised,
As bla[SEQ_SPLITTER]nks, benevolences, and I wot not what:
But what, o[SEQ_SPLITTER]' God's name, doth become of this?

NORTHUMBERLAND[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
But basely yielded upon compromise
That which his[SEQ_SPLITTER] noble ancestors achieved with blows:
More hath he[SEQ_SPLITTER] spent in peace than they in wars.

LORD ROSS:
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.

LORD W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ILLOUGHBY:
The king's grown bankrupt, like a broke[SEQ_SPLITTER]n man.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Reproach and dissolution h[SEQ_SPLITTER]angeth over him.

LORD ROSS:
He hath not money for[SEQ_SPLITTER] these Irish wars,
His burthenous taxations notwit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hstanding,
But by the robbing of the banish'd duke[SEQ_SPLITTER].

NORTHUMBERLAND:
His noble kinsman: most degener[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate king!
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest[SEQ_SPLITTER] sing,
Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;
We s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee the wind sit sore upon our sails,
And yet we st[SEQ_SPLITTER]rike not, but securely perish.

LORD ROSS:
We see [SEQ_SPLITTER]the very wreck that we must suffer;
And unavoided [SEQ_SPLITTER]is the danger now,
For suffering so the causes of [SEQ_SPLITTER]our wreck.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Not so; even through t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he hollow eyes of death
I spy life peering; but I [SEQ_SPLITTER]dare not say
How near the tidings of our comfort i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Nay, let us share thy thought[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, as thou dost ours.

LORD ROSS:
Be confident to [SEQ_SPLITTER]speak, Northumberland:
We three are but thyself; a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, speaking so,
Thy words are but as thoughts; th[SEQ_SPLITTER]erefore, be bold.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Then thus: I ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve from Port le Blanc, a bay
In Brittany, received[SEQ_SPLITTER] intelligence
That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold[SEQ_SPLITTER] Lord Cobham,
That late broke from the Duke of Exe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter,
His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
Sir John No[SEQ_SPLITTER]rbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,
All[SEQ_SPLITTER] these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne
With[SEQ_SPLITTER] eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
Are [SEQ_SPLITTER]making hither with all due expedience
And shortly [SEQ_SPLITTER]mean to touch our northern shore:
Perhaps they had[SEQ_SPLITTER] ere this, but that they stay
The first departing [SEQ_SPLITTER]of the king for Ireland.
If then we shall shake of[SEQ_SPLITTER]f our slavish yoke,
Imp out our drooping country's[SEQ_SPLITTER] broken wing,
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d crown,
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s gilt
And make high majesty look like itself,
Aw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
But if you fain[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, as fearing to do so,
Stay and be secret, and my[SEQ_SPLITTER]self will go.

LORD ROSS:
To horse, to horse! urge[SEQ_SPLITTER] doubts to them that fear.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Hold [SEQ_SPLITTER]out my horse, and I will first be there.

BUSHY:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]adam, your majesty is too much sad:
You promised, [SEQ_SPLITTER]when you parted with the king,
To lay aside life-h[SEQ_SPLITTER]arming heaviness
And entertain a cheerful disposit[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion.

QUEEN:
To please the king I did; to please m[SEQ_SPLITTER]yself
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
Why I sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould welcome such a guest as grief,
Save bidding f[SEQ_SPLITTER]arewell to so sweet a guest
As my sweet Richard: y[SEQ_SPLITTER]et again, methinks,
Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtune's womb,
Is coming towards me, and my inward [SEQ_SPLITTER]soul
With nothing trembles: at some thing it griev[SEQ_SPLITTER]es,
More than with parting from my lord the king.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BUSHY:
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shad[SEQ_SPLITTER]ows,
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
Div[SEQ_SPLITTER]ides one thing entire to many objects;
Like perspe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ctives, which rightly gazed upon
Show nothing but [SEQ_SPLITTER]confusion, eyed awry
Distinguish form: so your swe[SEQ_SPLITTER]et majesty,
Looking awry upon your lord's departur[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wai[SEQ_SPLITTER]l;
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadow[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]More than your lord's departure weep not: more's n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot seen;
Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.

Q[SEQ_SPLITTER]UEEN:
It may be so; but yet my inward soul
Persuad[SEQ_SPLITTER]es me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
I cannot but[SEQ_SPLITTER] be sad; so heavy sad
As, though on thinking on no[SEQ_SPLITTER] thought I think,
Makes me with heavy nothing fain[SEQ_SPLITTER]t and shrink.

BUSHY:
'Tis nothing but conceit, my[SEQ_SPLITTER] gracious lady.

QUEEN:
'Tis nothing less: conceit[SEQ_SPLITTER] is still derived
From some forefather grief; mine[SEQ_SPLITTER] is not so,
For nothing had begot my something gri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ef;
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
'[SEQ_SPLITTER]Tis in reversion that I do possess;
But what it is[SEQ_SPLITTER], that is not yet known; what
I cannot name; 'tis [SEQ_SPLITTER]nameless woe, I wot.

GREEN:
God save your majesty[SEQ_SPLITTER]! and well met, gentlemen:
I hope the king is not [SEQ_SPLITTER]yet shipp'd for Ireland.

QUEEN:
Why hopest thou s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o? 'tis better hope he is;
For his designs crave h[SEQ_SPLITTER]aste, his haste good hope:
Then wherefore dost tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u hope he is not shipp'd?

GREEN:
That he, our hop[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, might have retired his power,
And driven into d[SEQ_SPLITTER]espair an enemy's hope,
Who strongly hath set foot[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing in this land:
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals[SEQ_SPLITTER] himself,
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Ravenspurgh.

QUEEN:
Now God in heaven forbid!

[SEQ_SPLITTER]GREEN:
Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse[SEQ_SPLITTER],
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Per[SEQ_SPLITTER]cy,
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith all their powerful friends, are fled to him.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]BUSHY:
Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And all the rest revolted faction traitors?

GREEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
Hath br[SEQ_SPLITTER]oke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
And all t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he household servants fled with him
To Bolingbroke[SEQ_SPLITTER].

QUEEN:
So, Green, thou art the midwife to my wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
Now ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th my soul brought forth her prodigy,
And I, a gas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ping new-deliver'd mother,
Have woe to woe, sorrow[SEQ_SPLITTER] to sorrow join'd.

BUSHY:
Despair not, madam.

QU[SEQ_SPLITTER]EEN:
Who shall hinder me?
I will despair, and be a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t enmity
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
A [SEQ_SPLITTER]parasite, a keeper back of death,
Who gently would[SEQ_SPLITTER] dissolve the bands of life,
Which false hope ling[SEQ_SPLITTER]ers in extremity.

GREEN:
Here comes the Duke of Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ork.

QUEEN:
With signs of war about his aged neck[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
O, full of careful business are his looks!
Uncle[SEQ_SPLITTER], for God's sake, speak comfortable words.

DUKE O[SEQ_SPLITTER]F YORK:
Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur husband, he is gone to save far off,
Whilst oth[SEQ_SPLITTER]ers come to make him lose at home:
Here am I left [SEQ_SPLITTER]to underprop his land,
Who, weak with age, cannot [SEQ_SPLITTER]support myself:
Now comes the sick hour that his s[SEQ_SPLITTER]urfeit made;
Now shall he try his friends that fla[SEQ_SPLITTER]tter'd him.

Servant:
My lord, your son was gone b[SEQ_SPLITTER]efore I came.

DUKE OF YORK:
He was? Why, so! go a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll which way it will!
The nobles they are fled, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e commons they are cold,
And will, I fear, revolt [SEQ_SPLITTER]on Hereford's side.
Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to[SEQ_SPLITTER] my sister Gloucester;
Bid her send me presently a[SEQ_SPLITTER] thousand pound:
Hold, take my ring.

Servant:
My [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
To-day, [SEQ_SPLITTER]as I came by, I called there;
But I shall grieve y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou to report the rest.

DUKE OF YORK:
What is't, k[SEQ_SPLITTER]nave?

Servant:
An hour before I came, the duchess[SEQ_SPLITTER] died.

DUKE OF YORK:
God for his mercy! what a ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]de of woes
Comes rushing on this woeful land at on[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce!
I know not what to do: I would to God,
So my u[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntruth had not provoked him to it,
The king had cu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t off my head with my brother's.
What, are there n[SEQ_SPLITTER]o posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
How shall we do fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r money for these wars?
Come, sister,--cousin, I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould say--pray, pardon me.
Go, fellow, get thee ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]me, provide some carts
And bring away the armour t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat is there.
Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]f I know how or which way to order these affairs
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hus thrust disorderly into my hands,
Never believe[SEQ_SPLITTER] me. Both are my kinsmen:
The one is my sovereign,[SEQ_SPLITTER] whom both my oath
And duty bids defend; the other[SEQ_SPLITTER] again
Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
Well[SEQ_SPLITTER], somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
Dispose [SEQ_SPLITTER]of you.
Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
And mee[SEQ_SPLITTER]t me presently at Berkeley.
I should to Plashy too[SEQ_SPLITTER];
But time will not permit: all is uneven,
And eve[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry thing is left at six and seven.

BUSHY:
The win[SEQ_SPLITTER]d sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
But none re[SEQ_SPLITTER]turns. For us to levy power
Proportionable to the [SEQ_SPLITTER]enemy
Is all unpossible.

GREEN:
Besides, our near[SEQ_SPLITTER]ness to the king in love
Is near the hate of those[SEQ_SPLITTER] love not the king.

BAGOT:
And that's the waverin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g commons: for their love
Lies in their purses, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d whoso empties them
By so much fills their hearts[SEQ_SPLITTER] with deadly hate.

BUSHY:
Wherein the king stands[SEQ_SPLITTER] generally condemn'd.

BAGOT:
If judgement lie in [SEQ_SPLITTER]them, then so do we,
Because we ever have been nea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r the king.

GREEN:
Well, I will for refuge straig[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht to Bristol castle:
The Earl of Wiltshire is alr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eady there.

BUSHY:
Thither will I with you; for l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ittle office
The hateful commons will perform for [SEQ_SPLITTER]us,
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
Wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l you go along with us?

BAGOT:
No; I will to Irel[SEQ_SPLITTER]and to his majesty.
Farewell: if heart's presages [SEQ_SPLITTER]be not vain,
We three here art that ne'er shall me[SEQ_SPLITTER]et again.

BUSHY:
That's as York thrives to beat b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ack Bolingbroke.

GREEN:
Alas, poor duke! the task[SEQ_SPLITTER] he undertakes
Is numbering sands and drinking oce[SEQ_SPLITTER]ans dry:
Where one on his side fights, thousands w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill fly.
Farewell at once, for once, for all, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]ever.

BUSHY:
Well, we may meet again.

BAGOT:
I f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ear me, never.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How far is it, [SEQ_SPLITTER]my lord, to Berkeley now?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Believe[SEQ_SPLITTER] me, noble lord,
I am a stranger here in Glouceste[SEQ_SPLITTER]rshire:
These high wild hills and rough uneven way[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
Mak[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing the hard way sweet and delectable.
But I bethi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nk me what a weary way
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswol[SEQ_SPLITTER]d will be found
In Ross and Willoughby, wanting yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur company,
Which, I protest, hath very much begui[SEQ_SPLITTER]led
The tediousness and process of my travel:
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
The pres[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent benefit which I possess;
And hope to joy is li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ttle less in joy
Than hope enjoy'd: by this the we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ary lords
Shall make their way seem short, as mine[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath done
By sight of what I have, your noble com[SEQ_SPLITTER]pany.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Of much less value is my[SEQ_SPLITTER] company
Than your good words. But who comes here?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

NORTHUMBERLAND:
It is my son, young Harry Percy,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
Har[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry, how fares your uncle?

HENRY PERCY:
I had thou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]NORTHUMBERLAND:
Why, is he not with the queen?

HE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NRY PERCY:
No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ourt,
Broken his staff of office and dispersed
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] household of the king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What was [SEQ_SPLITTER]his reason?
He was not so resolved when last we sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake together.

HENRY PERCY:
Because your lordship [SEQ_SPLITTER]was proclaimed traitor.
But he, my lord, is gone t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o Ravenspurgh,
To offer service to the Duke of Her[SEQ_SPLITTER]eford,
And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat power the Duke of York had levied there;
Then [SEQ_SPLITTER]with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.

NORTHUM[SEQ_SPLITTER]BERLAND:
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my good lord, for that is not [SEQ_SPLITTER]forgot
Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge[SEQ_SPLITTER],
I never in my life did look on him.

NORTHUMBERL[SEQ_SPLITTER]AND:
Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

HENRY PERCY:
My gracious lord, I tender you my s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ervice,
Such as it is, being tender, raw and young[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
To more[SEQ_SPLITTER] approved service and desert.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
I count my[SEQ_SPLITTER]self in nothing else so happy
As in a soul remembe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ring my good friends;
And, as my fortune ripens wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th thy love,
It shall be still thy true love's rec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ompense:
My heart this covenant makes, my hand thu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s seals it.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
How far is it to Berk[SEQ_SPLITTER]eley? and what stir
Keeps good old York there with[SEQ_SPLITTER] his men of war?

HENRY PERCY:
There stands the ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]stle, by yon tuft of trees,
Mann'd with three hund[SEQ_SPLITTER]red men, as I have heard;
And in it are the Lords [SEQ_SPLITTER]of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
None else of name [SEQ_SPLITTER]and noble estimate.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here come the[SEQ_SPLITTER] Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Bloody with spurrin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g, fiery-red with haste.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Welco[SEQ_SPLITTER]me, my lords. I wot your love pursues
A banish'd t[SEQ_SPLITTER]raitor: all my treasury
Is yet but unfelt thanks, [SEQ_SPLITTER]which more enrich'd
Shall be your love and labour'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s recompense.

LORD ROSS:
Your presence makes us r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich, most noble lord.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And far su[SEQ_SPLITTER]rmounts our labour to attain it.

HENRY BOLINGBROK[SEQ_SPLITTER]E:
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
Whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch, till my infant fortune comes to years,
Stands [SEQ_SPLITTER]for my bounty. But who comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.

LORD BER[SEQ_SPLITTER]KELEY:
My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My lord, my answer is--to Lanc[SEQ_SPLITTER]aster;
And I am come to seek that name in England;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And I must find that title in your tongue,
Before[SEQ_SPLITTER] I make reply to aught you say.

LORD BERKELEY:
Mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]stake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
To raze[SEQ_SPLITTER] one title of your honour out:
To you, my lord, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]come, what lord you will,
From the most gracious r[SEQ_SPLITTER]egent of this land,
The Duke of York, to know what[SEQ_SPLITTER] pricks you on
To take advantage of the absent tim[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
And fright our native peace with self-born arms.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I shall not need transport my[SEQ_SPLITTER] words by you;
Here comes his grace in person. My [SEQ_SPLITTER]noble uncle!

DUKE OF YORK:
Show me thy humble hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt, and not thy knee,
Whose duty is deceiveable an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d false.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious uncle--

[SEQ_SPLITTER]DUKE OF YORK:
Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor unc[SEQ_SPLITTER]le me no uncle:
I am no traitor's uncle; and that [SEQ_SPLITTER]word 'grace.'
In an ungracious mouth is but profan[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.
Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
Dare[SEQ_SPLITTER]d once to touch a dust of England's ground?
But th[SEQ_SPLITTER]en more 'why?' why have they dared to march
So man[SEQ_SPLITTER]y miles upon her peaceful bosom,
Frighting her pal[SEQ_SPLITTER]e-faced villages with war
And ostentation of despi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sed arms?
Comest thou because the anointed king is[SEQ_SPLITTER] hence?
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
Were I but [SEQ_SPLITTER]now the lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt[SEQ_SPLITTER], thy father, and myself
Rescued the Black Prince,[SEQ_SPLITTER] that young Mars of men,
From forth the ranks of m[SEQ_SPLITTER]any thousand French,
O, then how quickly should th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is arm of mine.
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastis[SEQ_SPLITTER]e thee
And minister correction to thy fault!

HENR[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y BOLINGBROKE:
My gracious uncle, let me know my f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ault:
On what condition stands it and wherein?

DU[SEQ_SPLITTER]KE OF YORK:
Even in condition of the worst degree,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
In gross rebellion and detested treason:
Thou art[SEQ_SPLITTER] a banish'd man, and here art come
Before the expi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ration of thy time,
In braving arms against thy so[SEQ_SPLITTER]vereign.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As I was banish'd, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]was banish'd Hereford;
But as I come, I come for L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ancaster.
And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ook on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
You are [SEQ_SPLITTER]my father, for methinks in you
I see old Gaunt ali[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve; O, then, my father,
Will you permit that I sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll stand condemn'd
A wandering vagabond; my rights[SEQ_SPLITTER] and royalties
Pluck'd from my arms perforce and g[SEQ_SPLITTER]iven away
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rn?
If that my cousin king be King of England,
It [SEQ_SPLITTER]must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
You have a[SEQ_SPLITTER] son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
Had you first died[SEQ_SPLITTER], and he been thus trod down,
He should have found[SEQ_SPLITTER] his uncle Gaunt a father,
To rouse his wrongs and[SEQ_SPLITTER] chase them to the bay.
I am denied to sue my live[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry here,
And yet my letters-patents give me leave:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d these and all are all amiss employ'd.
What would[SEQ_SPLITTER] you have me do? I am a subject,
And I challenge l[SEQ_SPLITTER]aw: attorneys are denied me;
And therefore, person[SEQ_SPLITTER]ally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free desc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke hath been too[SEQ_SPLITTER] much abused.

LORD ROSS:
It stands your grace upo[SEQ_SPLITTER]n to do him right.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Base men by h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is endowments are made great.

DUKE OF YORK:
My lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rds of England, let me tell you this:
I have had f[SEQ_SPLITTER]eeling of my cousin's wrongs
And laboured all I co[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld to do him right;
But in this kind to come, in [SEQ_SPLITTER]braving arms,
Be his own carver and cut out his wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y,
To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d you that do abet him in this kind
Cherish rebell[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion and are rebels all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble[SEQ_SPLITTER] duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own; an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d for the right of that
We all have strongly sworn[SEQ_SPLITTER] to give him aid;
And let him ne'er see joy that b[SEQ_SPLITTER]reaks that oath!

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, well, I see [SEQ_SPLITTER]the issue of these arms:
I cannot mend it, I must [SEQ_SPLITTER]needs confess,
Because my power is weak and all il[SEQ_SPLITTER]l left:
But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I would attach you all and make you stoop
Unto the[SEQ_SPLITTER] sovereign mercy of the king;
But since I cannot, [SEQ_SPLITTER]be it known to you
I do remain as neuter. So, fare[SEQ_SPLITTER] you well;
Unless you please to enter in the castl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
And there repose you for this night.

HENRY BOLI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NGBROKE:
An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] we must win your grace to go with us
To Bristol c[SEQ_SPLITTER]astle, which they say is held
By Bushy, Bagot and [SEQ_SPLITTER]their complices,
The caterpillars of the commonwea[SEQ_SPLITTER]lth,
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.

D[SEQ_SPLITTER]UKE OF YORK:
It may be I will go with you: but yet[SEQ_SPLITTER] I'll pause;
For I am loath to break our country's[SEQ_SPLITTER] laws.
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Things past redress are now with me past care.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Captain:
My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten [SEQ_SPLITTER]days,
And hardly kept our countrymen together,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] yet we hear no tidings from the king;
Therefore w[SEQ_SPLITTER]e will disperse ourselves: farewell.

EARL OF SALI[SEQ_SPLITTER]SBURY:
Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.

Ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]ptain:
'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not [SEQ_SPLITTER]stay.
The bay-trees in our country are all wither'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
And le[SEQ_SPLITTER]an-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
Rich me[SEQ_SPLITTER]n look sad and ruffians dance and leap,
The one in[SEQ_SPLITTER] fear to lose what they enjoy,
The other to enjoy [SEQ_SPLITTER]by rage and war:
These signs forerun the death or [SEQ_SPLITTER]fall of kings.
Farewell: our countrymen are gone a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd fled,
As well assured Richard their king is dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, with the eyes [SEQ_SPLITTER]of heavy mind
I see thy glory like a shooting star[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
Thy su[SEQ_SPLITTER]n sets weeping in the lowly west,
Witnessing storm[SEQ_SPLITTER]s to come, woe and unrest:
Thy friends are fled to[SEQ_SPLITTER] wait upon thy foes,
And crossly to thy good all f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ortune goes.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bring forth these[SEQ_SPLITTER] men.
Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Since presently your souls must part your bodies-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-
With too much urging your pernicious lives,
For [SEQ_SPLITTER]'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
From of[SEQ_SPLITTER]f my hands, here in the view of men
I will unfold [SEQ_SPLITTER]some causes of your deaths.
You have misled a prin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce, a royal king,
A happy gentleman in blood and l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ineaments,
By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]You have in manner with your sinful hours
Made a d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ivorce betwixt his queen and him,
Broke the posses[SEQ_SPLITTER]sion of a royal bed
And stain'd the beauty of a fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir queen's cheeks
With tears drawn from her eyes b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y your foul wrongs.
Myself, a prince by fortune of[SEQ_SPLITTER] my birth,
Near to the king in blood, and near in [SEQ_SPLITTER]love
Till you did make him misinterpret me,
Have s[SEQ_SPLITTER]toop'd my neck under your injuries,
And sigh'd my [SEQ_SPLITTER]English breath in foreign clouds,
Eating the bitte[SEQ_SPLITTER]r bread of banishment;
Whilst you have fed upon my[SEQ_SPLITTER] signories,
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my fores[SEQ_SPLITTER]t woods,
From my own windows torn my household coa[SEQ_SPLITTER]t,
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
Save [SEQ_SPLITTER]men's opinions and my living blood,
To show the wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rld I am a gentleman.
This and much more, much mor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e than twice all this,
Condemns you to the death. [SEQ_SPLITTER]See them deliver'd over
To execution and the hand [SEQ_SPLITTER]of death.

BUSHY:
More welcome is the stroke of de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath to me
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, fare[SEQ_SPLITTER]well.

GREEN:
My comfort is that heaven will take [SEQ_SPLITTER]our souls
And plague injustice with the pains of h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My Lord Northumberland, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee them dispatch'd.
Uncle, you say the queen is at[SEQ_SPLITTER] your house;
For God's sake, fairly let her be ent[SEQ_SPLITTER]reated:
Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake special care my greetings be deliver'd.

DUKE [SEQ_SPLITTER]OF YORK:
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
Wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h letters of your love to her at large.

HENRY BOL[SEQ_SPLITTER]INGBROKE:
Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To fight with Glendower and his complices:
Awhile [SEQ_SPLITTER]to work, and after holiday.

KING RICHARD II:
Bark[SEQ_SPLITTER]loughly castle call they this at hand?

DUKE OF AU[SEQ_SPLITTER]MERLE:
Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air[SEQ_SPLITTER],
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING RICHARD II:
Needs must I like it well: I weep [SEQ_SPLITTER]for joy
To stand upon my kingdom once again.
Dear [SEQ_SPLITTER]earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
Though rebel[SEQ_SPLITTER]s wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
As a long-p[SEQ_SPLITTER]arted mother with her child
Plays fondly with her [SEQ_SPLITTER]tears and smiles in meeting,
So, weeping, smiling,[SEQ_SPLITTER] greet I thee, my earth,
And do thee favours with [SEQ_SPLITTER]my royal hands.
Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my g[SEQ_SPLITTER]entle earth,
Nor with thy sweets comfort his raven[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous sense;
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy v[SEQ_SPLITTER]enom,
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
Doi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng annoyance to the treacherous feet
Which with us[SEQ_SPLITTER]urping steps do trample thee:
Yield stinging nettl[SEQ_SPLITTER]es to mine enemies;
And when they from thy bosom p[SEQ_SPLITTER]luck a flower,
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng adder
Whose double tongue may with a mortal tou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
Mock [SEQ_SPLITTER]not my senseless conjuration, lords:
This earth sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all have a feeling and these stones
Prove armed so[SEQ_SPLITTER]ldiers, ere her native king
Shall falter under fou[SEQ_SPLITTER]l rebellion's arms.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Fear not,[SEQ_SPLITTER] my lord: that Power that made you king
Hath power[SEQ_SPLITTER] to keep you king in spite of all.
The means that [SEQ_SPLITTER]heaven yields must be embraced,
And not neglected;[SEQ_SPLITTER] else, if heaven would,
And we will not, heaven's [SEQ_SPLITTER]offer we refuse,
The proffer'd means of succor and[SEQ_SPLITTER] redress.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
He means, my lord, tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t we are too remiss;
Whilst Bolingbroke, through o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur security,
Grows strong and great in substance a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd in power.

KING RICHARD II:
Discomfortable cous[SEQ_SPLITTER]in! know'st thou not
That when the searching eye o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f heaven is hid,
Behind the globe, that lights the[SEQ_SPLITTER] lower world,
Then thieves and robbers range abroa[SEQ_SPLITTER]d unseen
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires [SEQ_SPLITTER]the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his [SEQ_SPLITTER]light through every guilty hole,
Then murders, tre[SEQ_SPLITTER]asons and detested sins,
The cloak of night being [SEQ_SPLITTER]pluck'd from off their backs,
Stand bare and naked[SEQ_SPLITTER], trembling at themselves?
So when this thief, thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s traitor, Bolingbroke,
Who all this while hath re[SEQ_SPLITTER]vell'd in the night
Whilst we were wandering with [SEQ_SPLITTER]the antipodes,
Shall see us rising in our throne, [SEQ_SPLITTER]the east,
His treasons will sit blushing in his fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce,
Not able to endure the sight of day,
But self-[SEQ_SPLITTER]affrighted tremble at his sin.
Not all the water i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an[SEQ_SPLITTER] anointed king;
The breath of worldly men cannot d[SEQ_SPLITTER]epose
The deputy elected by the Lord:
For every ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]n that Bolingbroke hath press'd
To lift shrewd ste[SEQ_SPLITTER]el against our golden crown,
God for his Richard h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath in heavenly pay
A glorious angel: then, if ang[SEQ_SPLITTER]els fight,
Weak men must fall, for heaven still gu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ards the right.
Welcome, my lord how far off lies [SEQ_SPLITTER]your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Nor near nor farth[SEQ_SPLITTER]er off, my gracious lord,
Than this weak arm: disc[SEQ_SPLITTER]omfort guides my tongue
And bids me speak of nothi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng but despair.
One day too late, I fear me, noble[SEQ_SPLITTER] lord,
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
O[SEQ_SPLITTER], call back yesterday, bid time return,
And thou s[SEQ_SPLITTER]halt have twelve thousand fighting men!
To-day, to[SEQ_SPLITTER]-day, unhappy day, too late,
O'erthrows thy joys, [SEQ_SPLITTER]friends, fortune and thy state:
For all the Welshm[SEQ_SPLITTER]en, hearing thou wert dead.
Are gone to Bolingbrok[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, dispersed and fled.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, [SEQ_SPLITTER]my liege; why looks your grace so pale?

KING RICH[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARD II:
But now the blood of twenty thousand men
D[SEQ_SPLITTER]id triumph in my face, and they are fled;
And, til[SEQ_SPLITTER]l so much blood thither come again,
Have I not rea[SEQ_SPLITTER]son to look pale and dead?
All souls that will be [SEQ_SPLITTER]safe fly from my side,
For time hath set a blot up[SEQ_SPLITTER]on my pride.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my liege; [SEQ_SPLITTER]remember who you are.

KING RICHARD II:
I had forg[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot myself; am I not king?
Awake, thou coward majes[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty! thou sleepest.
Is not the king's name twenty t[SEQ_SPLITTER]housand names?
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject s[SEQ_SPLITTER]trikes
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
High be[SEQ_SPLITTER] our thoughts: I know my uncle York
Hath power eno[SEQ_SPLITTER]ugh to serve our turn. But who comes here?

SIR ST[SEQ_SPLITTER]EPHEN SCROOP:
More health and happiness betide my [SEQ_SPLITTER]liege
Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING RICHARD II:
Mine ear is open and my heart pre[SEQ_SPLITTER]pared;
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]what loss is it to be rid of care?
Strives Bolingb[SEQ_SPLITTER]roke to be as great as we?
Greater he shall not be[SEQ_SPLITTER]; if he serve God,
We'll serve Him too and be his [SEQ_SPLITTER]fellow so:
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot men[SEQ_SPLITTER]d;
They break their faith to God as well as us:
Cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
The worst is d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eath, and death will have his day.

SIR STEPHEN SC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ROOP:
Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]bear the tidings of calamity.
Like an unseasonable[SEQ_SPLITTER] stormy day,
Which makes the silver rivers drown t[SEQ_SPLITTER]heir shores,
As if the world were all dissolved to[SEQ_SPLITTER] tears,
So high above his limits swells the rage
O[SEQ_SPLITTER]f Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
With har[SEQ_SPLITTER]d bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
White[SEQ_SPLITTER]-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
St[SEQ_SPLITTER]rive to speak big and clap their female joints
In [SEQ_SPLITTER]stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
The very be[SEQ_SPLITTER]adsmen learn to bend their bows
Of double-fatal ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]w against thy state;
Yea, distaff-women manage rus[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty bills
Against thy seat: both young and old rebe[SEQ_SPLITTER]l,
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING RICHARD II:
Too well, too well thou tell'st a[SEQ_SPLITTER] tale so ill.
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? wher[SEQ_SPLITTER]e is Bagot?
What is become of Bushy? where is Gree[SEQ_SPLITTER]n?
That they have let the dangerous enemy
Measure [SEQ_SPLITTER]our confines with such peaceful steps?
If we preva[SEQ_SPLITTER]il, their heads shall pay for it:
I warrant they h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave made peace with Bolingbroke.

SIR STEPHEN SCRO[SEQ_SPLITTER]OP:
Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KING RICHARD II:
O villains, vipers, damn'd with[SEQ_SPLITTER]out redemption!
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]n!
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my[SEQ_SPLITTER] heart!
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than [SEQ_SPLITTER]Judas!
Would they make peace? terrible hell make w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar
Upon their spotted souls for this offence!

SIR[SEQ_SPLITTER] STEPHEN SCROOP:
Sweet love, I see, changing his p[SEQ_SPLITTER]roperty,
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith heads, and not with hands; those whom you curs[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.

DU[SEQ_SPLITTER]KE OF AUMERLE:
Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ltshire dead?

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Ay, all of them[SEQ_SPLITTER] at Bristol lost their heads.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere is the duke my father with his power?

KING RI[SEQ_SPLITTER]CHARD II:
No matter where; of comfort no man speak[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow[SEQ_SPLITTER] on the bosom of the earth,
Let's choose executors[SEQ_SPLITTER] and talk of wills:
And yet not so, for what can w[SEQ_SPLITTER]e bequeath
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d nothing can we call our own but death
And that s[SEQ_SPLITTER]mall model of the barren earth
Which serves as pas[SEQ_SPLITTER]te and cover to our bones.
For God's sake, let us [SEQ_SPLITTER]sit upon the ground
And tell sad stories of the de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath of kings;
How some have been deposed; some sla[SEQ_SPLITTER]in in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have de[SEQ_SPLITTER]posed;
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping[SEQ_SPLITTER] kill'd;
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps De[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath his court and there the antic sits,
Scoffing h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is state and grinning at his pomp,
Allowing him a [SEQ_SPLITTER]breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd kill with looks,
Infusing him with self and vai[SEQ_SPLITTER]n conceit,
As if this flesh which walls about our [SEQ_SPLITTER]life,
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
Co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mes at the last and with a little pin
Bores throug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h his castle wall, and farewell king!
Cover your h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eads and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reve[SEQ_SPLITTER]rence: throw away respect,
Tradition, form and cer[SEQ_SPLITTER]emonious duty,
For you have but mistook me all thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s while:
I live with bread like you, feel want,
Ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]ste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
How can y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou say to me, I am a king?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
My[SEQ_SPLITTER] lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] presently prevent the ways to wail.
To fear the f[SEQ_SPLITTER]oe, since fear oppresseth strength,
Gives in your [SEQ_SPLITTER]weakness strength unto your foe,
And so your folli[SEQ_SPLITTER]es fight against yourself.
Fear and be slain; no w[SEQ_SPLITTER]orse can come to fight:
And fight and die is death[SEQ_SPLITTER] destroying death;
Where fearing dying pays death [SEQ_SPLITTER]servile breath.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My father hath a[SEQ_SPLITTER] power; inquire of him
And learn to make a body of[SEQ_SPLITTER] a limb.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou chidest me well: p[SEQ_SPLITTER]roud Bolingbroke, I come
To change blows with thee[SEQ_SPLITTER] for our day of doom.
This ague fit of fear is ove[SEQ_SPLITTER]r-blown;
An easy task it is to win our own.
Say, S[SEQ_SPLITTER]croop, where lies our uncle with his power?
Speak [SEQ_SPLITTER]sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.

SIR STE[SEQ_SPLITTER]PHEN SCROOP:
Men judge by the complexion of the sk[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
The state and inclination of the day:
So may you[SEQ_SPLITTER] by my dull and heavy eye,
My tongue hath but a he[SEQ_SPLITTER]avier tale to say.
I play the torturer, by small a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd small
To lengthen out the worst that must be sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]oken:
Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And all your northern castles yielded up,
And all [SEQ_SPLITTER]your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his party.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING RICHARD II:
Thou hast said enough.
Beshrew the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, cousin, which didst lead me forth
Of that sweet[SEQ_SPLITTER] way I was in to despair!
What say you now? what c[SEQ_SPLITTER]omfort have we now?
By heaven, I'll hate him everl[SEQ_SPLITTER]astingly
That bids me be of comfort any more.
Go t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
A king, woe'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s slave, shall kingly woe obey.
That power I have,[SEQ_SPLITTER] discharge; and let them go
To ear the land that h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath some hope to grow,
For I have none: let no man[SEQ_SPLITTER] speak again
To alter this, for counsel is but vai[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My liege, one word.

KING RIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]HARD II:
He does me double wrong
That wounds me wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th the flatteries of his tongue.
Discharge my foll[SEQ_SPLITTER]owers: let them hence away,
From Richard's night t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o Bolingbroke's fair day.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat by this intelligence we learn
The Welshmen are[SEQ_SPLITTER] dispersed, and Salisbury
Is gone to meet the king[SEQ_SPLITTER], who lately landed
With some few private friends [SEQ_SPLITTER]upon this coast.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The news is very[SEQ_SPLITTER] fair and good, my lord:
Richard not far from henc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hath hid his head.

DUKE OF YORK:
It would besee[SEQ_SPLITTER]m the Lord Northumberland
To say 'King Richard:' a[SEQ_SPLITTER]lack the heavy day
When such a sacred king should [SEQ_SPLITTER]hide his head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Your grace mistake[SEQ_SPLITTER]s; only to be brief
Left I his title out.

DUKE OF[SEQ_SPLITTER] YORK:
The time hath been,
Would you have been so [SEQ_SPLITTER]brief with him, he would
Have been so brief with y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou, to shorten you,
For taking so the head, your w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hole head's length.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mistake no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, uncle, further than you should.

DUKE OF YORK:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Take not, good cousin, further than you should.
Le[SEQ_SPLITTER]st you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.

HE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NRY BOLINGBROKE:
I know it, uncle, and oppose not [SEQ_SPLITTER]myself
Against their will. But who comes here?
Wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]come, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?

HE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NRY PERCY:
The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Against thy entrance.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Royally![SEQ_SPLITTER]
Why, it contains no king?

HENRY PERCY:
Yes, my g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood lord,
It doth contain a king; King Richard lie[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
And wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
Sir St[SEQ_SPLITTER]ephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Of holy reverenc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e; who, I cannot learn.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
O, belike[SEQ_SPLITTER] it is the Bishop of Carlisle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Noble lords,
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient [SEQ_SPLITTER]castle;
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of [SEQ_SPLITTER]parley
Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
Hen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry Bolingbroke
On both his knees doth kiss King Ri[SEQ_SPLITTER]chard's hand
And sends allegiance and true faith o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f heart
To his most royal person, hither come
Even[SEQ_SPLITTER] at his feet to lay my arms and power,
Provided th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at my banishment repeal'd
And lands restored again[SEQ_SPLITTER] be freely granted:
If not, I'll use the advantage[SEQ_SPLITTER] of my power
And lay the summer's dust with shower[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of blood
Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd E[SEQ_SPLITTER]nglishmen:
The which, how far off from the mind of[SEQ_SPLITTER] Bolingbroke
It is, such crimson tempest should be[SEQ_SPLITTER]drench
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's [SEQ_SPLITTER]land,
My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
Go, si[SEQ_SPLITTER]gnify as much, while here we march
Upon the grassy[SEQ_SPLITTER] carpet of this plain.
Let's march without the noi[SEQ_SPLITTER]se of threatening drum,
That from this castle's ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]tter'd battlements
Our fair appointments may be we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll perused.
Methinks King Richard and myself shoul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d meet
With no less terror than the elements
Of fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]re and water, when their thundering shock
At meeti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
Be he the fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]re, I'll be the yielding water:
The rage be his, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hilst on the earth I rain
My waters; on the earth,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and not on him.
March on, and mark King Richard h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow he looks.
See, see, King Richard doth himself a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ppear,
As doth the blushing discontented sun
From [SEQ_SPLITTER]out the fiery portal of the east,
When he perceive[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the envious clouds are bent
To dim his glory and[SEQ_SPLITTER] to stain the track
Of his bright passage to the o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ccident.

DUKE OF YORK:
Yet looks he like a king: [SEQ_SPLITTER]behold, his eye,
As bright as is the eagle's, ligh[SEQ_SPLITTER]tens forth
Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for [SEQ_SPLITTER]woe,
That any harm should stain so fair a show!

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING RICHARD II:
We are amazed; and thus long have [SEQ_SPLITTER]we stood
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
And i[SEQ_SPLITTER]f we be, how dare thy joints forget
To pay their a[SEQ_SPLITTER]wful duty to our presence?
If we be not, show us t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he hand of God
That hath dismissed us from our ste[SEQ_SPLITTER]wardship;
For well we know, no hand of blood and b[SEQ_SPLITTER]one
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
Un[SEQ_SPLITTER]less he do profane, steal, or usurp.
And though yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u think that all, as you have done,
Have torn thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r souls by turning them from us,
And we are barren[SEQ_SPLITTER] and bereft of friends;
Yet know, my master, God o[SEQ_SPLITTER]mnipotent,
Is mustering in his clouds on our behal[SEQ_SPLITTER]f
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
Your[SEQ_SPLITTER] children yet unborn and unbegot,
That lift your v[SEQ_SPLITTER]assal hands against my head
And threat the glory o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f my precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond me[SEQ_SPLITTER]thinks he stands--
That every stride he makes upon[SEQ_SPLITTER] my land
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
[SEQ_SPLITTER]The purple testament of bleeding war;
But ere the [SEQ_SPLITTER]crown he looks for live in peace,
Ten thousand blo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ody crowns of mothers' sons
Shall ill become the f[SEQ_SPLITTER]lower of England's face,
Change the complexion of [SEQ_SPLITTER]her maid-pale peace
To scarlet indignation and bed[SEQ_SPLITTER]ew
Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood[SEQ_SPLITTER].

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The king of heaven forbid our l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord the king
Should so with civil and uncivil arms[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
Harry Bol[SEQ_SPLITTER]ingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
And by the hon[SEQ_SPLITTER]ourable tomb he swears,
That stands upon your roya[SEQ_SPLITTER]l grandsire's bones,
And by the royalties of both [SEQ_SPLITTER]your bloods,
Currents that spring from one most gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]acious head,
And by the buried hand of warlike Gau[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt,
And by the worth and honour of himself,
Compri[SEQ_SPLITTER]sing all that may be sworn or said,
His coming hit[SEQ_SPLITTER]her hath no further scope
Than for his lineal roya[SEQ_SPLITTER]lties and to beg
Enfranchisement immediate on his [SEQ_SPLITTER]knees:
Which on thy royal party granted once,
His [SEQ_SPLITTER]glittering arms he will commend to rust,
His barbe[SEQ_SPLITTER]d steeds to stables, and his heart
To faithful ser[SEQ_SPLITTER]vice of your majesty.
This swears he, as he is a p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rince, is just;
And, as I am a gentleman, I credit[SEQ_SPLITTER] him.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, say thus t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he king returns:
His noble cousin is right welcome[SEQ_SPLITTER] hither;
And all the number of his fair demands
Sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all be accomplish'd without contradiction:
With al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l the gracious utterance thou hast
Speak to his ge[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntle hearing kind commends.
We do debase ourselves[SEQ_SPLITTER], cousin, do we not,
To look so poorly and to spea[SEQ_SPLITTER]k so fair?
Shall we call back Northumberland, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]send
Defiance to the traitor, and so die?

DUKE OF[SEQ_SPLITTER] AUMERLE:
No, good my lord; let's fight with gentl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e words
Till time lend friends and friends their h[SEQ_SPLITTER]elpful swords.

KING RICHARD II:
O God, O God! tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t e'er this tongue of mine,
That laid the sentence[SEQ_SPLITTER] of dread banishment
On yon proud man, should take[SEQ_SPLITTER] it off again
With words of sooth! O that I were a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s great
As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
Or[SEQ_SPLITTER] that I could forget what I have been,
Or not reme[SEQ_SPLITTER]mber what I must be now!
Swell'st thou, proud hear[SEQ_SPLITTER]t? I'll give thee scope to beat,
Since foes have s[SEQ_SPLITTER]cope to beat both thee and me.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]orthumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.

KING R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ICHARD II:
What must the king do now? must he subm[SEQ_SPLITTER]it?
The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]king shall be contented: must he lose
The name of [SEQ_SPLITTER]king? o' God's name, let it go:
I'll give my jewel[SEQ_SPLITTER]s for a set of beads,
My gorgeous palace for a her[SEQ_SPLITTER]mitage,
My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
My f[SEQ_SPLITTER]igured goblets for a dish of wood,
My sceptre for [SEQ_SPLITTER]a palmer's walking staff,
My subjects for a pair o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f carved saints
And my large kingdom for a little [SEQ_SPLITTER]grave,
A little little grave, an obscure grave;
Or[SEQ_SPLITTER] I'll be buried in the king's highway,
Some way of[SEQ_SPLITTER] common trade, where subjects' feet
May hourly tra[SEQ_SPLITTER]mple on their sovereign's head;
For on my heart th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey tread now whilst I live;
And buried once, why n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot upon my head?
Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-[SEQ_SPLITTER]hearted cousin!
We'll make foul weather with despi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sed tears;
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summ[SEQ_SPLITTER]er corn,
And make a dearth in this revolting land.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
And m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake some pretty match with shedding tears?
As thus[SEQ_SPLITTER], to drop them still upon one place,
Till they hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e fretted us a pair of graves
Within the earth; an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, therein laid,--there lies
Two kinsmen digg'd th[SEQ_SPLITTER]eir graves with weeping eyes.
Would not this ill d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o well? Well, well, I see
I talk but idly, and you[SEQ_SPLITTER] laugh at me.
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumb[SEQ_SPLITTER]erland,
What says King Bolingbroke? will his majes[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.

NORTHUMBER[SEQ_SPLITTER]LAND:
My lord, in the base court he doth attend
To[SEQ_SPLITTER] speak with you; may it please you to come down.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING RICHARD II:
Down, down I come; like glisterin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g Phaethon,
Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
In[SEQ_SPLITTER] the base court? Base court, where kings grow base[SEQ_SPLITTER],
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
In[SEQ_SPLITTER] the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g!
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What says his majesty[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Sorrow and grief of heart
Makes[SEQ_SPLITTER] him speak fondly, like a frantic man
Yet he is co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Stand all apart,
And show [SEQ_SPLITTER]fair duty to his majesty.
My gracious lord,--

KIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]G RICHARD II:
Fair cousin, you debase your princel[SEQ_SPLITTER]y knee
To make the base earth proud with kissing i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t:
Me rather had my heart might feel your love
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
Up, cousin, [SEQ_SPLITTER]up; your heart is up, I know,
Thus high at least, [SEQ_SPLITTER]although your knee be low.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My [SEQ_SPLITTER]gracious lord, I come but for mine own.

KING RICH[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARD II:
Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all[SEQ_SPLITTER].

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So far be mine, my most redo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ubted lord,
As my true service shall deserve your [SEQ_SPLITTER]love.

KING RICHARD II:
Well you deserve: they wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l deserve to have,
That know the strong'st and sur[SEQ_SPLITTER]est way to get.
Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y your eyes;
Tears show their love, but want their[SEQ_SPLITTER] remedies.
Cousin, I am too young to be your fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r,
Though you are old enough to be my heir.
What y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou will have, I'll give, and willing too;
For do w[SEQ_SPLITTER]e must what force will have us do.
Set on towards [SEQ_SPLITTER]London, cousin, is it so?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yea,[SEQ_SPLITTER] my good lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Then I must not s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay no.

QUEEN:
What sport shall we devise here in [SEQ_SPLITTER]this garden,
To drive away the heavy thought of ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]re?

Lady:
Madam, we'll play at bowls.

QUEEN:
'Tw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill make me think the world is full of rubs,
And t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat my fortune rubs against the bias.

Lady:
Madam[SEQ_SPLITTER], we'll dance.

QUEEN:
My legs can keep no measure[SEQ_SPLITTER] in delight,
When my poor heart no measure keeps i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n grief:
Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other s[SEQ_SPLITTER]port.

Lady:
Madam, we'll tell tales.

QUEEN:
Of s[SEQ_SPLITTER]orrow or of joy?

Lady:
Of either, madam.

QUEEN:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Of neither, girl:
For of joy, being altogether wan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ting,
It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
Or i[SEQ_SPLITTER]f of grief, being altogether had,
It adds more sor[SEQ_SPLITTER]row to my want of joy:
For what I have I need not [SEQ_SPLITTER]to repeat;
And what I want it boots not to complai[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.

Lady:
Madam, I'll sing.

QUEEN:
'Tis well that[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou hast cause
But thou shouldst please me bette[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, wouldst thou weep.

Lady:
I could weep, madam, [SEQ_SPLITTER]would it do you good.

QUEEN:
And I could sing, wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld weeping do me good,
And never borrow any tear [SEQ_SPLITTER]of thee.
But stay, here come the gardeners:
Let's [SEQ_SPLITTER]step into the shadow of these trees.
My wretchedne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss unto a row of pins,
They'll talk of state; for [SEQ_SPLITTER]every one doth so
Against a change; woe is forerun[SEQ_SPLITTER] with woe.

Gardener:
Go, bind thou up yon danglin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g apricocks,
Which, like unruly children, make the[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir sire
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight:
Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Go thou, and like an executioner,
Cut off the head[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of too fast growing sprays,
That look too lofty [SEQ_SPLITTER]in our commonwealth:
All must be even in our gover[SEQ_SPLITTER]nment.
You thus employ'd, I will go root away
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]noisome weeds, which without profit suck
The soil'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s fertility from wholesome flowers.

Servant:
Why [SEQ_SPLITTER]should we in the compass of a pale
Keep law and fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rm and due proportion,
Showing, as in a model, our[SEQ_SPLITTER] firm estate,
When our sea-walled garden, the whol[SEQ_SPLITTER]e land,
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers chok[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed up,
Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ru[SEQ_SPLITTER]in'd,
Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Swarming with caterpillars?

Gardener:
Hold thy p[SEQ_SPLITTER]eace:
He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
The w[SEQ_SPLITTER]eeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,
Are plu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,
I mean the Ea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.

Servant:
What, are[SEQ_SPLITTER] they dead?

Gardener:
They are; and Bolingbroke
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
As [SEQ_SPLITTER]we this garden! We at time of year
Do wound the ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]rk, the skin of our fruit-trees,
Lest, being over-[SEQ_SPLITTER]proud in sap and blood,
With too much riches it co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nfound itself:
Had he done so to great and growing[SEQ_SPLITTER] men,
They might have lived to bear and he to tast[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
We lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]p away, that bearing boughs may live:
Had he done [SEQ_SPLITTER]so, himself had borne the crown,
Which waste of id[SEQ_SPLITTER]le hours hath quite thrown down.

Servant:
What, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hink you then the king shall be deposed?

Gardener[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Depress'd he is already, and deposed
'Tis doubt [SEQ_SPLITTER]he will be: letters came last night
To a dear frie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd of the good Duke of York's,
That tell black tid[SEQ_SPLITTER]ings.

QUEEN:
O, I am press'd to death through wan[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of speaking!
Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ress this garden,
How dares thy harsh rude tongue [SEQ_SPLITTER]sound this unpleasing news?
What Eve, what serpent[SEQ_SPLITTER], hath suggested thee
To make a second fall of cur[SEQ_SPLITTER]sed man?
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h.

Gardener:
Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
King[SEQ_SPLITTER] Richard, he is in the mighty hold
Of Bolingbroke:[SEQ_SPLITTER] their fortunes both are weigh'd:
In your lord's s[SEQ_SPLITTER]cale is nothing but himself,
And some few vanities[SEQ_SPLITTER] that make him light;
But in the balance of great [SEQ_SPLITTER]Bolingbroke,
Besides himself, are all the English [SEQ_SPLITTER]peers,
And with that odds he weighs King Richard d[SEQ_SPLITTER]own.
Post you to London, and you will find it so;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I speak no more than every one doth know.

QUEEN:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
Doth [SEQ_SPLITTER]not thy embassage belong to me,
And am I last that[SEQ_SPLITTER] knows it? O, thou think'st
To serve me last, that[SEQ_SPLITTER] I may longest keep
Thy sorrow in my breast. Come,[SEQ_SPLITTER] ladies, go,
To meet at London London's king in wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.
What, was I born to this, that my sad look
Shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
Gardene[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, for telling me these news of woe,
Pray God the [SEQ_SPLITTER]plants thou graft'st may never grow.

GARDENER:
Po[SEQ_SPLITTER]or queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould my skill were subject to thy curse.
Here did [SEQ_SPLITTER]she fall a tear; here in this place
I'll set a ban[SEQ_SPLITTER]k of rue, sour herb of grace:
Rue, even for ruth, [SEQ_SPLITTER]here shortly shall be seen,
In the remembrance of [SEQ_SPLITTER]a weeping queen.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Call forth Ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]got.
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;
What thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
Who wrought[SEQ_SPLITTER] it with the king, and who perform'd
The bloody of[SEQ_SPLITTER]fice of his timeless end.

BAGOT:
Then set before [SEQ_SPLITTER]my face the Lord Aumerle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Cous[SEQ_SPLITTER]in, stand forth, and look upon that man.

BAGOT:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]y Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
Scorns t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
In that dead [SEQ_SPLITTER]time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
I heard [SEQ_SPLITTER]you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
That reacheth f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom the restful English court
As far as Calais, to[SEQ_SPLITTER] mine uncle's head?'
Amongst much other talk, that[SEQ_SPLITTER] very time,
I heard you say that you had rather re[SEQ_SPLITTER]fuse
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
Than [SEQ_SPLITTER]Bolingbroke's return to England;
Adding withal how[SEQ_SPLITTER] blest this land would be
In this your cousin's de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Princes and noble lords,
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at answer shall I make to this base man?
Shall I s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o much dishonour my fair stars,
On equal terms to [SEQ_SPLITTER]give him chastisement?
Either I must, or have mine[SEQ_SPLITTER] honour soil'd
With the attainder of his slanderou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s lips.
There is my gage, the manual seal of death[SEQ_SPLITTER],
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
In[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy heart-blood, though being all too base
To sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]in the temper of my knightly sword.

HENRY BOLINGB[SEQ_SPLITTER]ROKE:
Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting one, I would he were th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e best
In all this presence that hath moved me so.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

LORD FITZWATER:
If that thy valour stand on symp[SEQ_SPLITTER]athy,
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'[SEQ_SPLITTER]st,
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest [SEQ_SPLITTER]it
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's deat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h.
If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
Where it[SEQ_SPLITTER] was forged, with my rapier's point.

DUKE OF AUME[SEQ_SPLITTER]RLE:
Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day[SEQ_SPLITTER].

LORD FITZWATER:
Now by my soul, I would it were[SEQ_SPLITTER] this hour.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Fitzwater, thou art [SEQ_SPLITTER]damn'd to hell for this.

HENRY PERCY:
Aumerle, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou liest; his honour is as true
In this appeal as [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou art all unjust;
And that thou art so, there I[SEQ_SPLITTER] throw my gage,
To prove it on thee to the extreme[SEQ_SPLITTER]st point
Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou da[SEQ_SPLITTER]rest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
An if I do not, may my han[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds rot off
And never brandish more revengeful stee[SEQ_SPLITTER]l
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!

Lord:
I t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ask the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
And s[SEQ_SPLITTER]pur thee on with full as many lies
As may be hollo[SEQ_SPLITTER]a'd in thy treacherous ear
From sun to sun: there [SEQ_SPLITTER]is my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou darest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Who sets me else? by [SEQ_SPLITTER]heaven, I'll throw at all:
I have a thousand spiri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts in one breast,
To answer twenty thousand such a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s you.

DUKE OF SURREY:
My Lord Fitzwater, I do re[SEQ_SPLITTER]member well
The very time Aumerle and you did talk[SEQ_SPLITTER].

LORD FITZWATER:
'Tis very true: you were in pre[SEQ_SPLITTER]sence then;
And you can witness with me this is tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue.

DUKE OF SURREY:
As false, by heaven, as heave[SEQ_SPLITTER]n itself is true.

LORD FITZWATER:
Surrey, thou li[SEQ_SPLITTER]est.

DUKE OF SURREY:
Dishonourable boy!
That lie [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall lie so heavy on my sword,
That it shall rend[SEQ_SPLITTER]er vengeance and revenge
Till thou the lie-giver a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd that lie do lie
In earth as quiet as thy father[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s skull:
In proof whereof, there is my honour's p[SEQ_SPLITTER]awn;
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.

LORD[SEQ_SPLITTER] FITZWATER:
How fondly dost thou spur a forward ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]rse!
If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
And spit upon[SEQ_SPLITTER] him, whilst I say he lies,
And lies, and lies: th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere is my bond of faith,
To tie thee to my strong [SEQ_SPLITTER]correction.
As I intend to thrive in this new worl[SEQ_SPLITTER]d,
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
Besides, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] heard the banish'd Norfolk say
That thou, Aumerle[SEQ_SPLITTER], didst send two of thy men
To execute the noble d[SEQ_SPLITTER]uke at Calais.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Some honest Chris[SEQ_SPLITTER]tian trust me with a gage
That Norfolk lies: here [SEQ_SPLITTER]do I throw down this,
If he may be repeal'd, to tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y his honour.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
These difference[SEQ_SPLITTER]s shall all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeal[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d: repeal'd he shall be,
And, though mine enemy, [SEQ_SPLITTER]restored again
To all his lands and signories: whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]n he's return'd,
Against Aumerle we will enforce h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is trial.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
That honourable day[SEQ_SPLITTER] shall ne'er be seen.
Many a time hath banish'd No[SEQ_SPLITTER]rfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian[SEQ_SPLITTER] field,
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cros[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
And t[SEQ_SPLITTER]oil'd with works of war, retired himself
To Italy;[SEQ_SPLITTER] and there at Venice gave
His body to that pleasan[SEQ_SPLITTER]t country's earth,
And his pure soul unto his capt[SEQ_SPLITTER]ain Christ,
Under whose colours he had fought so l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ong.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, bishop, is Norfolk d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ead?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
As surely as I live, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Sweet peace conduct his [SEQ_SPLITTER]sweet soul to the bosom
Of good old Abraham! Lords[SEQ_SPLITTER] appellants,
Your differences shall all rest under[SEQ_SPLITTER] gage
Till we assign you to your days of trial.

D[SEQ_SPLITTER]UKE OF YORK:
Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing so[SEQ_SPLITTER]ul
Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o the possession of thy royal hand:
Ascend his thr[SEQ_SPLITTER]one, descending now from him;
And long live Henry,[SEQ_SPLITTER] fourth of that name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
In God's[SEQ_SPLITTER] name, I'll ascend the regal throne.

BISHOP OF CA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RLISLE:
Marry. God forbid!
Worst in this royal pre[SEQ_SPLITTER]sence may I speak,
Yet best beseeming me to speak [SEQ_SPLITTER]the truth.
Would God that any in this noble presen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Of noble [SEQ_SPLITTER]Richard! then true noblesse would
Learn him forbea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rance from so foul a wrong.
What subject can give [SEQ_SPLITTER]sentence on his king?
And who sits here that is no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Richard's subject?
Thieves are not judged but th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey are by to hear,
Although apparent guilt be seen[SEQ_SPLITTER] in them;
And shall the figure of God's majesty,
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]is captain, steward, deputy-elect,
Anointed, crown[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed, planted many years,
Be judged by subject and i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nferior breath,
And he himself not present? O, for[SEQ_SPLITTER]fend it, God,
That in a Christian climate souls re[SEQ_SPLITTER]fined
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a dee[SEQ_SPLITTER]d!
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
Stir[SEQ_SPLITTER]r'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
My Lord o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f Hereford here, whom you call king,
Is a foul tra[SEQ_SPLITTER]itor to proud Hereford's king:
And if you crown hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m, let me prophesy:
The blood of English shall man[SEQ_SPLITTER]ure the ground,
And future ages groan for this fou[SEQ_SPLITTER]l act;
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidel[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
Shall[SEQ_SPLITTER] kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
Disorde[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, horror, fear and mutiny
Shall here inhabit, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] this land be call'd
The field of Golgotha and dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]d men's skulls.
O, if you raise this house against[SEQ_SPLITTER] this house,
It will the woefullest division prove[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
Prevent it[SEQ_SPLITTER], resist it, let it not be so,
Lest child, child's[SEQ_SPLITTER] children, cry against you woe!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
Of [SEQ_SPLITTER]capital treason we arrest you here.
My Lord of Wes[SEQ_SPLITTER]tminster, be it your charge
To keep him safely til[SEQ_SPLITTER]l his day of trial.
May it please you, lords, to g[SEQ_SPLITTER]rant the commons' suit.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Fetch [SEQ_SPLITTER]hither Richard, that in common view
He may surrend[SEQ_SPLITTER]er; so we shall proceed
Without suspicion.

DUKE O[SEQ_SPLITTER]F YORK:
I will be his conduct.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
Procur[SEQ_SPLITTER]e your sureties for your days of answer.
Little ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e we beholding to your love,
And little look'd for[SEQ_SPLITTER] at your helping hands.

KING RICHARD II:
Alack, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy am I sent for to a king,
Before I have shook of[SEQ_SPLITTER]f the regal thoughts
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly[SEQ_SPLITTER] yet have learn'd
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]bend my limbs:
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
To this submission. Yet I well remember
The favo[SEQ_SPLITTER]urs of these men: were they not mine?
Did they not[SEQ_SPLITTER] sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?
So Judas did to [SEQ_SPLITTER]Christ: but he, in twelve,
Found truth in all but [SEQ_SPLITTER]one: I, in twelve thousand, none.
God save the kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g! Will no man say amen?
Am I both priest and cler[SEQ_SPLITTER]k? well then, amen.
God save the king! although I [SEQ_SPLITTER]be not he;
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.
To do what service am I sent for hither?

DUKE [SEQ_SPLITTER]OF YORK:
To do that office of thine own good will
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Which tired majesty did make thee offer,
The resig[SEQ_SPLITTER]nation of thy state and crown
To Henry Bolingbroke[SEQ_SPLITTER].

KING RICHARD II:
Give me the crown. Here, cousi[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, seize the crown;
Here cousin:
On this side my h[SEQ_SPLITTER]and, and on that side yours.
Now is this golden cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]own like a deep well
That owes two buckets, fillin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g one another,
The emptier ever dancing in the air[SEQ_SPLITTER],
The other down, unseen and full of water:
That b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ucket down and full of tears am I,
Drinking my gri[SEQ_SPLITTER]efs, whilst you mount up on high.

HENRY BOLINGBRO[SEQ_SPLITTER]KE:
I thought you had been willing to resign.

KIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]G RICHARD II:
My crown I am; but still my griefs a[SEQ_SPLITTER]re mine:
You may my glories and my state depose,
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut not my griefs; still am I king of those.

HENRY[SEQ_SPLITTER] BOLINGBROKE:
Part of your cares you give me with [SEQ_SPLITTER]your crown.

KING RICHARD II:
Your cares set up do[SEQ_SPLITTER] not pluck my cares down.
My care is loss of care,[SEQ_SPLITTER] by old care done;
Your care is gain of care, by n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ew care won:
The cares I give I have, though given[SEQ_SPLITTER] away;
They tend the crown, yet still with me they[SEQ_SPLITTER] stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Are you contented to re[SEQ_SPLITTER]sign the crown?

KING RICHARD II:
Ay, no; no, ay; [SEQ_SPLITTER]for I must nothing be;
Therefore no no, for I resi[SEQ_SPLITTER]gn to thee.
Now mark me, how I will undo myself;
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] give this heavy weight from off my head
And this [SEQ_SPLITTER]unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
The pride of kingly[SEQ_SPLITTER] sway from out my heart;
With mine own tears I was[SEQ_SPLITTER]h away my balm,
With mine own hands I give away my[SEQ_SPLITTER] crown,
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
With mine own breath release all duty's rites:
Al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l pomp and majesty I do forswear;
My manors, rents[SEQ_SPLITTER], revenues I forego;
My acts, decrees, and statute[SEQ_SPLITTER]s I deny:
God pardon all oaths that are broke to m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e!
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!
God save King[SEQ_SPLITTER] Harry, unking'd Richard says,
And send him many y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ears of sunshine days!
What more remains?

NORTHUM[SEQ_SPLITTER]BERLAND:
No more, but that you read
These accusati[SEQ_SPLITTER]ons and these grievous crimes
Committed by your pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]rson and your followers
Against the state and prof[SEQ_SPLITTER]it of this land;
That, by confessing them, the sou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ls of men
May deem that you are worthily deposed.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
KING RICHARD II:
Must I do so? and must I ravel o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,
If t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy offences were upon record,
Would it not shame t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee in so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them? [SEQ_SPLITTER]If thou wouldst,
There shouldst thou find one hein[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous article,
Containing the deposing of a king
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
Mark'd wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:
Nay, all [SEQ_SPLITTER]of you that stand and look upon,
Whilst that my wr[SEQ_SPLITTER]etchedness doth bait myself,
Though some of you wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th Pilate wash your hands
Showing an outward pity;[SEQ_SPLITTER] yet you Pilates
Have here deliver'd me to my sour[SEQ_SPLITTER] cross,
And water cannot wash away your sin.

NORT[SEQ_SPLITTER]HUMBERLAND:
My lord, dispatch; read o'er these art[SEQ_SPLITTER]icles.

KING RICHARD II:
Mine eyes are full of tea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs, I cannot see:
And yet salt water blinds them n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot so much
But they can see a sort of traitors her[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.
Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
I find my[SEQ_SPLITTER]self a traitor with the rest;
For I have given her[SEQ_SPLITTER]e my soul's consent
To undeck the pompous body of [SEQ_SPLITTER]a king;
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
P[SEQ_SPLITTER]roud majesty a subject, state a peasant.

NORTHUMB[SEQ_SPLITTER]ERLAND:
My lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
No lord of th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ine, thou haught insulting man,
Nor no man's lord;[SEQ_SPLITTER] I have no name, no title,
No, not that name was g[SEQ_SPLITTER]iven me at the font,
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eavy day,
That I have worn so many winters out,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d know not now what name to call myself!
O that I [SEQ_SPLITTER]were a mockery king of snow,
Standing before the s[SEQ_SPLITTER]un of Bolingbroke,
To melt myself away in water-dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ops!
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly go[SEQ_SPLITTER]od,
An if my word be sterling yet in England,
Let [SEQ_SPLITTER]it command a mirror hither straight,
That it may s[SEQ_SPLITTER]how me what a face I have,
Since it is bankrupt of[SEQ_SPLITTER] his majesty.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go some of you a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd fetch a looking-glass.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Read o'[SEQ_SPLITTER]er this paper while the glass doth come.

KING RIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]HARD II:
Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Urge it no more, my Lord [SEQ_SPLITTER]Northumberland.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The commons will [SEQ_SPLITTER]not then be satisfied.

KING RICHARD II:
They shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be satisfied: I'll read enough,
When I do see th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e very book indeed
Where all my sins are writ, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] that's myself.
Give me the glass, and therein wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l I read.
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow stru[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck
So many blows upon this face of mine,
And made [SEQ_SPLITTER]no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,
Like to my f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ollowers in prosperity,
Thou dost beguile me! Was [SEQ_SPLITTER]this face the face
That every day under his househ[SEQ_SPLITTER]old roof
Did keep ten thousand men? was this the f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace
That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]as this the face that faced so many follies,
And w[SEQ_SPLITTER]as at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
A brittle glo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry shineth in this face:
As brittle as the glory i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the face;
For there it is, crack'd in a hundred [SEQ_SPLITTER]shivers.
Mark, silent king, the moral of this spor[SEQ_SPLITTER]t,
How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.

HEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]RY BOLINGBROKE:
The shadow of your sorrow hath des[SEQ_SPLITTER]troy'd
The shadow or your face.

KING RICHARD II:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Say that again.
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's[SEQ_SPLITTER] see:
'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d these external manners of laments
Are merely sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]dows to the unseen grief
That swells with silence [SEQ_SPLITTER]in the tortured soul;
There lies the substance: an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d I thank thee, king,
For thy great bounty, that n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot only givest
Me cause to wail but teachest me th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e way
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And then be gone and trouble you no more.
Shall I [SEQ_SPLITTER]obtain it?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Name it, fair cousi[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.

KING RICHARD II:
'Fair cousin'? I am greater t[SEQ_SPLITTER]han a king:
For when I was a king, my flatterers
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere then but subjects; being now a subject,
I have[SEQ_SPLITTER] a king here to my flatterer.
Being so great, I ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve no need to beg.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yet ask.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING RICHARD II:
And shall I have?

HENRY BOLINGBRO[SEQ_SPLITTER]KE:
You shall.

KING RICHARD II:
Then give me leav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to go.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Whither?

KING RICHAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]D II:
Whither you will, so I were from your sights[SEQ_SPLITTER].

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go, some of you convey him t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o the Tower.

KING RICHARD II:
O, good! convey? co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nveyers are you all,
That rise thus nimbly by a tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue king's fall.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
On Wednesday n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ext we solemnly set down
Our coronation: lords, pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]epare yourselves.

Abbot:
A woeful pageant have we[SEQ_SPLITTER] here beheld.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
The woe's to co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me; the children yet unborn.
Shall feel this day a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s sharp to them as thorn.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
You ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly clergymen, is there no plot
To rid the realm of[SEQ_SPLITTER] this pernicious blot?

Abbot:
My lord,
Before I f[SEQ_SPLITTER]reely speak my mind herein,
You shall not only tak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e the sacrament
To bury mine intents, but also to [SEQ_SPLITTER]effect
Whatever I shall happen to devise.
I see yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur brows are full of discontent,
Your hearts of so[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrow and your eyes of tears:
Come home with me to [SEQ_SPLITTER]supper; and I'll lay
A plot shall show us all a me[SEQ_SPLITTER]rry day.

QUEEN:
This way the king will come; this[SEQ_SPLITTER] is the way
To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
Is doom'd a[SEQ_SPLITTER] prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
Here let us rest, [SEQ_SPLITTER]if this rebellious earth
Have any resting for her [SEQ_SPLITTER]true king's queen.
But soft, but see, or rather do[SEQ_SPLITTER] not see,
My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold[SEQ_SPLITTER],
That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
And wash h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im fresh again with true-love tears.
Ah, thou, the[SEQ_SPLITTER] model where old Troy did stand,
Thou map of honou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, thou King Richard's tomb,
And not King Richard;[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou most beauteous inn,
Why should hard-favour'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] grief be lodged in thee,
When triumph is become a[SEQ_SPLITTER]n alehouse guest?

KING RICHARD II:
Join not with [SEQ_SPLITTER]grief, fair woman, do not so,
To make my end too s[SEQ_SPLITTER]udden: learn, good soul,
To think our former state[SEQ_SPLITTER] a happy dream;
From which awaked, the truth of wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at we are
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]weet,
To grim Necessity, and he and I
Will keep a [SEQ_SPLITTER]league till death. Hie thee to France
And cloister[SEQ_SPLITTER] thee in some religious house:
Our holy lives must[SEQ_SPLITTER] win a new world's crown,
Which our profane hours [SEQ_SPLITTER]here have stricken down.

QUEEN:
What, is my Richa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd both in shape and mind
Transform'd and weaken'd[SEQ_SPLITTER]? hath Bolingbroke deposed
Thine intellect? hath h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e been in thy heart?
The lion dying thrusteth fort[SEQ_SPLITTER]h his paw,
And wounds the earth, if nothing else, [SEQ_SPLITTER]with rage
To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-[SEQ_SPLITTER]like,
Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d fawn on rage with base humility,
Which art a lio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n and a king of beasts?

KING RICHARD II:
A king o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
I had been [SEQ_SPLITTER]still a happy king of men.
Good sometime queen, pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]epare thee hence for France:
Think I am dead and t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat even here thou takest,
As from my death-bed, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy last living leave.
In winter's tedious nights s[SEQ_SPLITTER]it by the fire
With good old folks and let them te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll thee tales
Of woeful ages long ago betid;
And e[SEQ_SPLITTER]re thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,
Tell[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou the lamentable tale of me
And send the heare[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs weeping to their beds:
For why, the senseless b[SEQ_SPLITTER]rands will sympathize
The heavy accent of thy movi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng tongue
And in compassion weep the fire out;
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
For th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e deposing of a rightful king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My[SEQ_SPLITTER] lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
You mus[SEQ_SPLITTER]t to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
And, madam, ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e is order ta'en for you;
With all swift speed you[SEQ_SPLITTER] must away to France.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumber[SEQ_SPLITTER]land, thou ladder wherewithal
The mounting Bolingb[SEQ_SPLITTER]roke ascends my throne,
The time shall not be many[SEQ_SPLITTER] hours of age
More than it is ere foul sin gatheri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng head
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ink,
Though he divide the realm and give thee half[SEQ_SPLITTER],
It is too little, helping him to all;
And he sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll think that thou, which know'st the way
To plant[SEQ_SPLITTER] unrightful kings, wilt know again,
Being ne'er so[SEQ_SPLITTER] little urged, another way
To pluck him headlong f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom the usurped throne.
The love of wicked men con[SEQ_SPLITTER]verts to fear;
That fear to hate, and hate turns o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne or both
To worthy danger and deserved death.

N[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORTHUMBERLAND:
My guilt be on my head, and there a[SEQ_SPLITTER]n end.
Take leave and part; for you must part fort[SEQ_SPLITTER]hwith.

KING RICHARD II:
Doubly divorced! Bad men,[SEQ_SPLITTER] you violate
A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd me,
And then betwixt me and my married wife.
Le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
And yet n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
Part us, Northu[SEQ_SPLITTER]mberland; I toward the north,
Where shivering cold[SEQ_SPLITTER] and sickness pines the clime;
My wife to France: [SEQ_SPLITTER]from whence, set forth in pomp,
She came adorned h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ither like sweet May,
Sent back like Hallowmas or [SEQ_SPLITTER]short'st of day.

QUEEN:
And must we be divided? m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust we part?

KING RICHARD II:
Ay, hand from hand,[SEQ_SPLITTER] my love, and heart from heart.

QUEEN:
Banish us [SEQ_SPLITTER]both and send the king with me.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat were some love but little policy.

QUEEN:
Then[SEQ_SPLITTER] whither he goes, thither let me go.

KING RICHARD[SEQ_SPLITTER] II:
So two, together weeping, make one woe.
Weep [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou for me in France, I for thee here;
Better far[SEQ_SPLITTER] off than near, be ne'er the near.
Go, count thy w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay with sighs; I mine with groans.

QUEEN:
So long[SEQ_SPLITTER]est way shall have the longest moans.

KING RICHAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]D II:
Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being[SEQ_SPLITTER] short,
And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
Since[SEQ_SPLITTER], wedding it, there is such length in grief;
One k[SEQ_SPLITTER]iss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
Thus g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive I mine, and thus take I thy heart.

QUEEN:
Giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e me mine own again; 'twere no good part
To take o[SEQ_SPLITTER]n me to keep and kill thy heart.
So, now I have mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne own again, be gone,
That I might strive to kill[SEQ_SPLITTER] it with a groan.

KING RICHARD II:
We make woe wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]nton with this fond delay:
Once more, adieu; the r[SEQ_SPLITTER]est let sorrow say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
My lord, you[SEQ_SPLITTER] told me you would tell the rest,
When weeping mad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e you break the story off,
of our two cousins comi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng into London.

DUKE OF YORK:
Where did I leave?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
DUCHESS OF YORK:
At that sad stop, my lord,
Where[SEQ_SPLITTER] rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
Threw d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust and rubbish on King Richard's head.

DUKE OF Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORK:
Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
Which his aspi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ring rider seem'd to know,
With slow but stately p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace kept on his course,
Whilst all tongues cried '[SEQ_SPLITTER]God save thee,
Bolingbroke!'
You would have though[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the very windows spake,
So many greedy looks of [SEQ_SPLITTER]young and old
Through casements darted their desir[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing eyes
Upon his visage, and that all the walls
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith painted imagery had said at once
'Jesu preserv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
Whilst he, from the[SEQ_SPLITTER] one side to the other turning,
Bareheaded, lower [SEQ_SPLITTER]than his proud steed's neck,
Bespake them thus: 'I[SEQ_SPLITTER] thank you, countrymen:'
And thus still doing, thu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s he pass'd along.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alack, poor R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ichard! where rode he the whilst?

DUKE OF YORK:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]s in a theatre, the eyes of men,
After a well-grac[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed actor leaves the stage,
Are idly bent on him th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at enters next,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious[SEQ_SPLITTER];
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God sav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e him!'
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
Which [SEQ_SPLITTER]with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
His face sti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll combating with tears and smiles,
The badges of [SEQ_SPLITTER]his grief and patience,
That had not God, for some[SEQ_SPLITTER] strong purpose, steel'd
The hearts of men, they m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust perforce have melted
And barbarism itself have[SEQ_SPLITTER] pitied him.
But heaven hath a hand in these event[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
Whose st[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate and honour I for aye allow.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Here comes my son Aumerle.

DUKE OF YORK:
Aumerle [SEQ_SPLITTER]that was;
But that is lost for being Richard's fri[SEQ_SPLITTER]end,
And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am in parliament pledge for his truth
And lasting [SEQ_SPLITTER]fealty to the new-made king.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]come, my son: who are the violets now
That strew t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he green lap of the new come spring?

DUKE OF AUME[SEQ_SPLITTER]RLE:
Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
Go[SEQ_SPLITTER]d knows I had as lief be none as one.

DUKE OF YOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]K:
Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
Wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For aught I know, my lord, they[SEQ_SPLITTER] do.

DUKE OF YORK:
You will be there, I know.

DU[SEQ_SPLITTER]KE OF AUMERLE:
If God prevent not, I purpose so.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]DUKE OF YORK:
What seal is that, that hangs withou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thy bosom?
Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My lord, 'tis nothing[SEQ_SPLITTER].

DUKE OF YORK:
No matter, then, who see it;
I wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll be satisfied; let me see the writing.

DUKE OF [SEQ_SPLITTER]AUMERLE:
I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
It [SEQ_SPLITTER]is a matter of small consequence,
Which for some r[SEQ_SPLITTER]easons I would not have seen.

DUKE OF YORK:
Which[SEQ_SPLITTER] for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
I fear, I f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What should you fear?
'Ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]s nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.

DUKE OF Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORK:
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
Boy, let[SEQ_SPLITTER] me see the writing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do beseec[SEQ_SPLITTER]h you, pardon me; I may not show it.

DUKE OF YORK[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
Treas[SEQ_SPLITTER]on! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!

DUCHES[SEQ_SPLITTER]S OF YORK:
What is the matter, my lord?

DUKE OF Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORK:
Ho! who is within there?
Saddle my horse.
God[SEQ_SPLITTER] for his mercy, what treachery is here!

DUCHESS O[SEQ_SPLITTER]F YORK:
Why, what is it, my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
G[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
Now, by m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ine honour, by my life, by my troth,
I will appeac[SEQ_SPLITTER]h the villain.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the matte[SEQ_SPLITTER]r?

DUKE OF YORK:
Peace, foolish woman.

DUCHESS O[SEQ_SPLITTER]F YORK:
I will not peace. What is the matter, Aume[SEQ_SPLITTER]rle.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Good mother, be content; it[SEQ_SPLITTER] is no more
Than my poor life must answer.

DUCHES[SEQ_SPLITTER]S OF YORK:
Thy life answer!

DUKE OF YORK:
Bring m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e my boots: I will unto the king.

DUCHESS OF YORK[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.

DUKE[SEQ_SPLITTER] OF YORK:
Give me my boots, I say.

DUCHESS OF YOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]K:
Why, York, what wilt thou do?
Wilt thou not hid[SEQ_SPLITTER]e the trespass of thine own?
Have we more sons? or[SEQ_SPLITTER] are we like to have?
Is not my teeming date drunk[SEQ_SPLITTER] up with time?
And wilt thou pluck my fair son fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m mine age,
And rob me of a happy mother's name?
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]s he not like thee? is he not thine own?

DUKE OF [SEQ_SPLITTER]YORK:
Thou fond mad woman,
Wilt thou conceal this [SEQ_SPLITTER]dark conspiracy?
A dozen of them here have ta'en t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he sacrament,
And interchangeably set down their h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ands,
To kill the king at Oxford.

DUCHESS OF YORK[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
He shall be none;
We'll keep him here: then what[SEQ_SPLITTER] is that to him?

DUKE OF YORK:
Away, fond woman! [SEQ_SPLITTER]were he twenty times my son,
I would appeach him.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hadst thou groan'd for him
As I [SEQ_SPLITTER]have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
But now I[SEQ_SPLITTER] know thy mind; thou dost suspect
That I have been[SEQ_SPLITTER] disloyal to thy bed,
And that he is a bastard, no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thy son:
Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at mind:
He is as like thee as a man may be,
Not l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ike to me, or any of my kin,
And yet I love him.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]DUKE OF YORK:
Make way, unruly woman!

DUCHESS OF [SEQ_SPLITTER]YORK:
After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]pur post, and get before him to the king,
And beg [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
I'll not be long[SEQ_SPLITTER] behind; though I be old,
I doubt not but to ride [SEQ_SPLITTER]as fast as York:
And never will I rise up from the[SEQ_SPLITTER] ground
Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away,[SEQ_SPLITTER] be gone!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no man tell me o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f my unthrifty son?
'Tis full three months since I[SEQ_SPLITTER] did see him last;
If any plague hang over us, 'ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]s he.
I would to God, my lords, he might be found:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] there, they say, he daily doth frequent,
With unr[SEQ_SPLITTER]estrained loose companions,
Even such, they say, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s stand in narrow lanes,
And beat our watch, and r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ob our passengers;
Which he, young wanton and effe[SEQ_SPLITTER]minate boy,
Takes on the point of honour to suppor[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
So dissolute a crew.

HENRY PERCY:
My lord, some[SEQ_SPLITTER] two days since I saw the prince,
And told him of [SEQ_SPLITTER]those triumphs held at Oxford.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And what said the gallant?

HENRY PERCY:
His answ[SEQ_SPLITTER]er was, he would unto the stews,
And from the comm[SEQ_SPLITTER]on'st creature pluck a glove,
And wear it as a fav[SEQ_SPLITTER]our; and with that
He would unhorse the lustiest c[SEQ_SPLITTER]hallenger.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As dissolute as des[SEQ_SPLITTER]perate; yet through both
I see some sparks of bett[SEQ_SPLITTER]er hope, which elder years
May happily bring forth[SEQ_SPLITTER]. But who comes here?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he king?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What means our cousin[SEQ_SPLITTER], that he stares and looks
So wildly?

DUKE OF AUM[SEQ_SPLITTER]ERLE:
God save your grace! I do beseech your majes[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty,
To have some conference with your grace alone.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Withdraw yourselves, and leav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e us here alone.
What is the matter with our cousi[SEQ_SPLITTER]n now?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
For ever may my knees gro[SEQ_SPLITTER]w to the earth,
My tongue cleave to my roof within[SEQ_SPLITTER] my mouth
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.

HE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NRY BOLINGBROKE:
Intended or committed was this fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ult?
If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,
To w[SEQ_SPLITTER]in thy after-love I pardon thee.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]no man enter till my tale be done.

HENRY BOLINGBR[SEQ_SPLITTER]OKE:
Have thy desire.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLING[SEQ_SPLITTER]BROKE:
Villain, I'll make thee safe.

DUKE OF AUME[SEQ_SPLITTER]RLE:
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause [SEQ_SPLITTER]to fear.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the matter, uncle? speak;
Recover breath; tell u[SEQ_SPLITTER]s how near is danger,
That we may arm us to encoun[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter it.

DUKE OF YORK:
Peruse this writing here, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd thou shalt know
The treason that my haste forbi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds me show.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Remember, as thou re[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad'st, thy promise pass'd:
I do repent me; read no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t my name there
My heart is not confederate with m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y hand.

DUKE OF YORK:
It was, villain, ere thy ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd did set it down.
I tore it from the traitor's b[SEQ_SPLITTER]osom, king;
Fear, and not love, begets his peniten[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce:
Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
A serp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent that will sting thee to the heart.

HENRY BOLI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NGBROKE:
O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
O [SEQ_SPLITTER]loyal father of a treacherous son!
Thou sheer, imm[SEQ_SPLITTER]aculate and silver fountain,
From when this stream[SEQ_SPLITTER] through muddy passages
Hath held his current and [SEQ_SPLITTER]defiled himself!
Thy overflow of good converts to [SEQ_SPLITTER]bad,
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
This d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eadly blot in thy digressing son.

DUKE OF YORK:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]o shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
And he shall[SEQ_SPLITTER] spend mine honour with his shame,
As thriftless s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ons their scraping fathers' gold.
Mine honour live[SEQ_SPLITTER]s when his dishonour dies,
Or my shamed life in hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s dishonour lies:
Thou kill'st me in his life; giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing him breath,
The traitor lives, the true man's [SEQ_SPLITTER]put to death.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A woman, and thy aunt, great [SEQ_SPLITTER]king; 'tis I.
Speak with me, pity me, open the doo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.

HENRY [SEQ_SPLITTER]BOLINGBROKE:
Our scene is alter'd from a serious t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hing,
And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.[SEQ_SPLITTER]'
My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
I know [SEQ_SPLITTER]she is come to pray for your foul sin.

DUKE OF YO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RK:
If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
More sins f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or this forgiveness prosper may.
This fester'd joi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt cut off, the rest rest sound;
This let alone wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll all the rest confound.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O king[SEQ_SPLITTER], believe not this hard-hearted man!
Love loving n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot itself none other can.

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou fran[SEQ_SPLITTER]tic woman, what dost thou make here?
Shall thy old[SEQ_SPLITTER] dugs once more a traitor rear?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.

HE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NRY BOLINGBROKE:
Rise up, good aunt.

DUCHESS OF Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORK:
Not yet, I thee beseech:
For ever will I walk[SEQ_SPLITTER] upon my knees,
And never see day that the happy s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ees,
Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,
By[SEQ_SPLITTER] pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.

DUKE OF[SEQ_SPLITTER] AUMERLE:
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

DUKE OF YORK:
Against them both my true joints b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ended be.
Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any[SEQ_SPLITTER] grace!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Pleads he in earnest? lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ok upon his face;
His eyes do drop no tears, his p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rayers are in jest;
His words come from his mouth,[SEQ_SPLITTER] ours from our breast:
He prays but faintly and wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld be denied;
We pray with heart and soul and all[SEQ_SPLITTER] beside:
His weary joints would gladly rise, I kno[SEQ_SPLITTER]w;
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they g[SEQ_SPLITTER]row:
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours[SEQ_SPLITTER] of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers do o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut-pray his; then let them have
That mercy which t[SEQ_SPLITTER]rue prayer ought to have.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good[SEQ_SPLITTER] aunt, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Nay, do not say[SEQ_SPLITTER], 'stand up;'
Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards [SEQ_SPLITTER]'stand up.'
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to[SEQ_SPLITTER] teach,
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy s[SEQ_SPLITTER]peech.
I never long'd to hear a word till now;
Say[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
The word[SEQ_SPLITTER] is short, but not so short as sweet;
No word like[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.

DUKE OF YORK[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'

[SEQ_SPLITTER]DUCHESS OF YORK:
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to [SEQ_SPLITTER]destroy?
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord[SEQ_SPLITTER],
That set'st the word itself against the word!
Sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]eak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
The chop[SEQ_SPLITTER]ping French we do not understand.
Thine eye begins[SEQ_SPLITTER] to speak; set thy tongue there;
Or in thy piteous[SEQ_SPLITTER] heart plant thou thine ear;
That hearing how our [SEQ_SPLITTER]plaints and prayers do pierce,
Pity may move thee [SEQ_SPLITTER]'pardon' to rehearse.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aun[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I do not sue to sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd;
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.

HENRY [SEQ_SPLITTER]BOLINGBROKE:
I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O happy vantage of a kneeling k[SEQ_SPLITTER]nee!
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
Twice[SEQ_SPLITTER] saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
But makes [SEQ_SPLITTER]one pardon strong.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
With all my[SEQ_SPLITTER] heart
I pardon him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A god on ea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rth thou art.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
But for our trus[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty brother-in-law and the abbot,
With all the rest[SEQ_SPLITTER] of that consorted crew,
Destruction straight shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l dog them at the heels.
Good uncle, help to order[SEQ_SPLITTER] several powers
To Oxford, or where'er these trait[SEQ_SPLITTER]ors are:
They shall not live within this world, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]swear,
But I will have them, if I once know where.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
Your mot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her well hath pray'd, and prove you true.

DUCHESS[SEQ_SPLITTER] OF YORK:
Come, my old son: I pray God make thee n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ew.

EXTON:
Didst thou not mark the king, what wor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds he spake,
'Have I no friend will rid me of this[SEQ_SPLITTER] living fear?'
Was it not so?

Servant:
These were[SEQ_SPLITTER] his very words.

EXTON:
'Have I no friend?' quoth[SEQ_SPLITTER] he: he spake it twice,
And urged it twice togethe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, did he not?

Servant:
He did.

EXTON:
And speak[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing it, he wistly look'd on me,
And who should say[SEQ_SPLITTER], 'I would thou wert the man'
That would divorce t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his terror from my heart;'
Meaning the king at Pom[SEQ_SPLITTER]fret. Come, let's go:
I am the king's friend, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]will rid his foe.

KING RICHARD II:
I have been st[SEQ_SPLITTER]udying how I may compare
This prison where I live [SEQ_SPLITTER]unto the world:
And for because the world is popul[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous
And here is not a creature but myself,
I canno[SEQ_SPLITTER]t do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
My brain I'll pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve the female to my soul,
My soul the father; and [SEQ_SPLITTER]these two beget
A generation of still-breeding tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ughts,
And these same thoughts people this little [SEQ_SPLITTER]world,
In humours like the people of this world,
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or no thought is contented. The better sort,
As th[SEQ_SPLITTER]oughts of things divine, are intermix'd
With scrup[SEQ_SPLITTER]les and do set the word itself
Against the word:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]s thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
'It i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s as hard to come as for a camel
To thread the pos[SEQ_SPLITTER]tern of a small needle's eye.'
Thoughts tending to[SEQ_SPLITTER] ambition, they do plot
Unlikely wonders; how thes[SEQ_SPLITTER]e vain weak nails
May tear a passage through the f[SEQ_SPLITTER]linty ribs
Of this hard world, my ragged prison wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]lls,
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
Nor[SEQ_SPLITTER] shall not be the last; like silly beggars
Who sit[SEQ_SPLITTER]ting in the stocks refuge their shame,
That many h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave and others must sit there;
And in this thought[SEQ_SPLITTER] they find a kind of ease,
Bearing their own misfo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtunes on the back
Of such as have before endured [SEQ_SPLITTER]the like.
Thus play I in one person many people,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd none contented: sometimes am I king;
Then treas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ons make me wish myself a beggar,
And so I am: the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n crushing penury
Persuades me I was better when a[SEQ_SPLITTER] king;
Then am I king'd again: and by and by
Think[SEQ_SPLITTER] that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
And straight a[SEQ_SPLITTER]m nothing: but whate'er I be,
Nor I nor any man th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at but man is
With nothing shall be pleased, till [SEQ_SPLITTER]he be eased
With being nothing. Music do I hear?
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]a, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,
When ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]me is broke and no proportion kept!
So is it in th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e music of men's lives.
And here have I the dainti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ness of ear
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tring;
But for the concord of my state and time
Ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]d not an ear to hear my true time broke.
I wasted [SEQ_SPLITTER]time, and now doth time waste me;
For now hath tim[SEQ_SPLITTER]e made me his numbering clock:
My thoughts are min[SEQ_SPLITTER]utes; and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unt[SEQ_SPLITTER]o mine eyes, the outward watch,
Whereto my finger,[SEQ_SPLITTER] like a dial's point,
Is pointing still, in cleans[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing them from tears.
Now sir, the sound that tells[SEQ_SPLITTER] what hour it is
Are clamorous groans, which strik[SEQ_SPLITTER]e upon my heart,
Which is the bell: so sighs and t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ears and groans
Show minutes, times, and hours: bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t my time
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud j[SEQ_SPLITTER]oy,
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the cl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ock.
This music mads me; let it sound no more;
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] though it have holp madmen to their wits,
In me i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t seems it will make wise men mad.
Yet blessing on[SEQ_SPLITTER] his heart that gives it me!
For 'tis a sign of lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve; and love to Richard
Is a strange brooch in thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s all-hating world.

Groom:
Hail, royal prince!

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING RICHARD II:
Thanks, noble peer;
The cheapest o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f us is ten groats too dear.
What art thou? and ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w comest thou hither,
Where no man never comes but[SEQ_SPLITTER] that sad dog
That brings me food to make misfortu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne live?

Groom:
I was a poor groom of thy stable,[SEQ_SPLITTER] king,
When thou wert king; who, travelling toward[SEQ_SPLITTER]s York,
With much ado at length have gotten leave
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
O, [SEQ_SPLITTER]how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
In London st[SEQ_SPLITTER]reets, that coronation-day,
When Bolingbroke rode [SEQ_SPLITTER]on roan Barbary,
That horse that thou so often has[SEQ_SPLITTER]t bestrid,
That horse that I so carefully have dre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss'd!

KING RICHARD II:
Rode he on Barbary? Tell m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, gentle friend,
How went he under him?

Groom:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]o proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.

KING RIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]HARD II:
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back[SEQ_SPLITTER]!
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
Thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
Woul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d he not stumble? would he not fall down,
Since pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ide must have a fall, and break the neck
Of that p[SEQ_SPLITTER]roud man that did usurp his back?
Forgiveness, hor[SEQ_SPLITTER]se! why do I rail on thee,
Since thou, created to [SEQ_SPLITTER]be awed by man,
Wast born to bear? I was not made [SEQ_SPLITTER]a horse;
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
Spu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]eeper:
Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KING RICHARD II:
If thou love me, 'tis time thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] wert away.

Groom:
What my tongue dares not, that[SEQ_SPLITTER] my heart shall say.

Keeper:
My lord, will't plea[SEQ_SPLITTER]se you to fall to?

KING RICHARD II:
Taste of it f[SEQ_SPLITTER]irst, as thou art wont to do.

Keeper:
My lord, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
lately came fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m the king, commands the contrary.

KING RICHARD I[SEQ_SPLITTER]I:
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
Pat[SEQ_SPLITTER]ience is stale, and I am weary of it.

Keeper:
Hel[SEQ_SPLITTER]p, help, help!

KING RICHARD II:
How now! what mea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns death in this rude assault?
Villain, thy own ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd yields thy death's instrument.
Go thou, and fil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l another room in hell.
That hand shall burn in ne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ver-quenching fire
That staggers thus my person. E[SEQ_SPLITTER]xton, thy fierce hand
Hath with the king's blood s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tain'd the king's own land.
Mount, mount, my soul![SEQ_SPLITTER] thy seat is up on high;
Whilst my gross flesh sin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ks downward, here to die.

EXTON:
As full of valou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r as of royal blood:
Both have I spill'd; O would [SEQ_SPLITTER]the deed were good!
For now the devil, that told m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I did well,
Says that this deed is chronicled in[SEQ_SPLITTER] hell.
This dead king to the living king I'll bear[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Kind uncle York, the latest new[SEQ_SPLITTER]s we hear
Is that the rebels have consumed with fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]re
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
But wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
Welcome,[SEQ_SPLITTER] my lord what is the news?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
First,[SEQ_SPLITTER] to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
The nex[SEQ_SPLITTER]t news is, I have to London sent
The heads of Oxfo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:
The manner of thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r taking may appear
At large discoursed in this pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]per here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
We thank thee, gentl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e Percy, for thy pains;
And to thy worth will add [SEQ_SPLITTER]right worthy gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
My lord, I ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve from Oxford sent to London
The heads of Brocas [SEQ_SPLITTER]and Sir Bennet Seely,
Two of the dangerous consort[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed traitors
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thy pains, Fitzwater, shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l not be forgot;
Right noble is thy merit, well I [SEQ_SPLITTER]wot.

HENRY PERCY:
The grand conspirator, Abbot of[SEQ_SPLITTER] Westminster,
With clog of conscience and sour mel[SEQ_SPLITTER]ancholy
Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] here is Carlisle living, to abide
Thy kingly doom[SEQ_SPLITTER] and sentence of his pride.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]rlisle, this is your doom:
Choose out some secret [SEQ_SPLITTER]place, some reverend room,
More than thou hast, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d with it joy thy life;
So as thou livest in peace[SEQ_SPLITTER], die free from strife:
For though mine enemy thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] hast ever been,
High sparks of honour in thee hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I seen.

EXTON:
Great king, within this coffin I[SEQ_SPLITTER] present
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless li[SEQ_SPLITTER]es
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
Richard [SEQ_SPLITTER]of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.

HENRY BOLINGBR[SEQ_SPLITTER]OKE:
Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrough[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my he[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad and all this famous land.

EXTON:
From your own[SEQ_SPLITTER] mouth, my lord, did I this deed.

HENRY BOLINGBRO[SEQ_SPLITTER]KE:
They love not poison that do poison need,
Nor [SEQ_SPLITTER]do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
I hate the [SEQ_SPLITTER]murderer, love him murdered.
The guilt of conscien[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce take thou for thy labour,
But neither my good w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord nor princely favour:
With Cain go wander throu[SEQ_SPLITTER]gh shades of night,
And never show thy head by day[SEQ_SPLITTER] nor light.
Lords, I protest, my soul is full of w[SEQ_SPLITTER]oe,
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,
And put[SEQ_SPLITTER] on sullen black incontinent:
I'll make a voyage t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o the Holy Land,
To wash this blood off from my gu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ilty hand:
March sadly after; grace my mournings h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere;
In weeping after this untimely bier.


SAMPSO[SEQ_SPLITTER]N:
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

GR[SEQ_SPLITTER]EGORY:
No, for then we should be colliers.

SAMPSO[SEQ_SPLITTER]N:
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

GREGOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y:
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ollar.

SAMPSON:
I strike quickly, being moved.

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]REGORY:
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
SAMPSON:
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

GREGORY:
To move is to stir; and to be valiant i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou run[SEQ_SPLITTER]n'st away.

SAMPSON:
A dog of that house shall mov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e me to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or [SEQ_SPLITTER]maid of Montague's.

GREGORY:
That shows thee a we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ak slave; for the weakest goes
to the wall.

SAMPS[SEQ_SPLITTER]ON:
True; and therefore women, being the weaker ve[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll push
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is maids
to the wall.

GREGORY:
The quarrel is bet[SEQ_SPLITTER]ween our masters and us their men.

SAMPSON:
'Tis [SEQ_SPLITTER]all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
have [SEQ_SPLITTER]fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
maid[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, and cut off their heads.

GREGORY:
The heads of[SEQ_SPLITTER] the maids?

SAMPSON:
Ay, the heads of the maids, [SEQ_SPLITTER]or their maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ilt.

GREGORY:
They must take it in sense that fee[SEQ_SPLITTER]l it.

SAMPSON:
Me they shall feel while I am able[SEQ_SPLITTER] to stand: and
'tis known I am a pretty piece of f[SEQ_SPLITTER]lesh.

GREGORY:
'Tis well thou art not fish; if th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou hadst, thou
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool[SEQ_SPLITTER]! here comes
two of the house of the Montagues.

S[SEQ_SPLITTER]AMPSON:
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck thee.

GREGORY:
How! turn thy back and run?

SA[SEQ_SPLITTER]MPSON:
Fear me not.

GREGORY:
No, marry; I fear th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee!

SAMPSON:
Let us take the law of our sides; le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t them begin.

GREGORY:
I will frown as I pass by,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and let them take it as
they list.

SAMPSON:
Nay,[SEQ_SPLITTER] as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
which[SEQ_SPLITTER] is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

ABRAHAM:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:
I do[SEQ_SPLITTER] bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM:
Do you bite your th[SEQ_SPLITTER]umb at us, sir?

SAMPSON:

GREGORY:
No.

SAMPSON:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I[SEQ_SPLITTER]
bite my thumb, sir.

GREGORY:
Do you quarrel, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

ABRAHAM:
Quarrel sir! no, sir.

SAMPSON:
If you[SEQ_SPLITTER] do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou.

ABRAHAM:
No better.

SAMPSON:
Well, sir.

GRE[SEQ_SPLITTER]GORY:
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's [SEQ_SPLITTER]kinsmen.

SAMPSON:
Yes, better, sir.

ABRAHAM:
You[SEQ_SPLITTER] lie.

SAMPSON:
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, reme[SEQ_SPLITTER]mber thy swashing blow.

BENVOLIO:
Part, fools!
Pu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t up your swords; you know not what you do.

TYBAL[SEQ_SPLITTER]T:
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hind[SEQ_SPLITTER]s?
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

BENV[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLIO:
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
O[SEQ_SPLITTER]r manage it to part these men with me.

TYBALT:
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
As [SEQ_SPLITTER]I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee[SEQ_SPLITTER], coward!

First Citizen:
Clubs, bills, and partis[SEQ_SPLITTER]ans! strike! beat them down!
Down with the Capulet[SEQ_SPLITTER]s! down with the Montagues!

CAPULET:
What noise i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s this? Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULET:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

CAP[SEQ_SPLITTER]ULET:
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And f[SEQ_SPLITTER]lourishes his blade in spite of me.

MONTAGUE:
Tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

LADY [SEQ_SPLITTER]MONTAGUE:
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe[SEQ_SPLITTER].

PRINCE:
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
Will [SEQ_SPLITTER]they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purp[SEQ_SPLITTER]le fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]orture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemp[SEQ_SPLITTER]er'd weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence [SEQ_SPLITTER]of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of [SEQ_SPLITTER]an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their gra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in[SEQ_SPLITTER] hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your c[SEQ_SPLITTER]anker'd hate:
If ever you disturb our streets agai[SEQ_SPLITTER]n,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]For this time, all the rest depart away:
You Capul[SEQ_SPLITTER]et; shall go along with me:
And, Montague, come yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure in [SEQ_SPLITTER]this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-p[SEQ_SPLITTER]lace.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

MONTAGUE:
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

BEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]VOLIO:
Here were the servants of your adversary,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I dre[SEQ_SPLITTER]w to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tyba[SEQ_SPLITTER]lt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed[SEQ_SPLITTER] defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and [SEQ_SPLITTER]cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him [SEQ_SPLITTER]in scorn:
While we were interchanging thrusts and [SEQ_SPLITTER]blows,
Came more and more and fought on part and p[SEQ_SPLITTER]art,
Till the prince came, who parted either part.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

LADY MONTAGUE:
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to[SEQ_SPLITTER]-day?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

BE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NVOLIO:
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
P[SEQ_SPLITTER]eer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troub[SEQ_SPLITTER]led mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from[SEQ_SPLITTER] the city's side,
So early walking did I see your [SEQ_SPLITTER]son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is affections by my own,
That most are busied when[SEQ_SPLITTER] they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

MONTAGUE:
Many a morning hath he there been seen[SEQ_SPLITTER],
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
Add[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the[SEQ_SPLITTER] furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om Aurora's bed,
Away from the light steals home m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himse[SEQ_SPLITTER]lf,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd makes himself an artificial night:
Black and po[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtentous must this humour prove,
Unless good couns[SEQ_SPLITTER]el may the cause remove.

BENVOLIO:
My noble uncle[SEQ_SPLITTER], do you know the cause?

MONTAGUE:
I neither know[SEQ_SPLITTER] it nor can learn of him.

BENVOLIO:
Have you impo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtuned him by any means?

MONTAGUE:
Both by myself[SEQ_SPLITTER] and many other friends:
But he, his own affection[SEQ_SPLITTER]s' counsellor,
Is to himself--I will not say how t[SEQ_SPLITTER]rue--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]r from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet l[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the su[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow[SEQ_SPLITTER].
We would as willingly give cure as know.

BENVOL[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside[SEQ_SPLITTER];
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

MON[SEQ_SPLITTER]TAGUE:
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

BENVOL[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
Good-morrow, cousin.

ROMEO:
Is the day so you[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng?

BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine.

ROMEO:
Ay me![SEQ_SPLITTER] sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went[SEQ_SPLITTER] hence so fast?

BENVOLIO:
It was. What sadness le[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO:
Not having that, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich, having, makes them short.

BENVOLIO:
In love?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ROMEO:
Out--

BENVOLIO:
Of love?

ROMEO:
Out of [SEQ_SPLITTER]her favour, where I am in love.

BENVOLIO:
Alas, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nnous and rough in proof!

ROMEO:
Alas, that love,[SEQ_SPLITTER] whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes[SEQ_SPLITTER], see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O[SEQ_SPLITTER] me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but [SEQ_SPLITTER]more with love.
Why, then, O brawling love! O lovi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smok[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel n[SEQ_SPLITTER]o love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?

BENVOLIO:
No[SEQ_SPLITTER], coz, I rather weep.

ROMEO:
Good heart, at what?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

BENVOLIO:
At thy good heart's oppression.

ROMEO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of min[SEQ_SPLITTER]e own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt prop[SEQ_SPLITTER]agate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to to[SEQ_SPLITTER]o much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in[SEQ_SPLITTER] lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]vers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll, my coz.

BENVOLIO:
Soft! I will go along;
An i[SEQ_SPLITTER]f you leave me so, you do me wrong.

ROMEO:
Tut, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not Rome[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, he's some other where.

BENVOLIO:
Tell me in sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]dness, who is that you love.

ROMEO:
What, shall I[SEQ_SPLITTER] groan and tell thee?

BENVOLIO:
Groan! why, no.
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut sadly tell me who.

ROMEO:
Bid a sick man in sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]dness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman[SEQ_SPLITTER].

BENVOLIO:
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you [SEQ_SPLITTER]loved.

ROMEO:
A right good mark-man! And she's fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir I love.

BENVOLIO:
A right fair mark, fair coz,[SEQ_SPLITTER] is soonest hit.

ROMEO:
Well, in that hit you mis[SEQ_SPLITTER]s: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath [SEQ_SPLITTER]Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well [SEQ_SPLITTER]arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unh[SEQ_SPLITTER]arm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor op[SEQ_SPLITTER]e her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she is rich i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n beauty, only poor,
That when she dies with beaut[SEQ_SPLITTER]y dies her store.

BENVOLIO:
Then she hath sworn t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat she will still live chaste?

ROMEO:
She hath, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For beauty s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tarved with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all [SEQ_SPLITTER]posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too f[SEQ_SPLITTER]air,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath[SEQ_SPLITTER] forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead [SEQ_SPLITTER]that live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO:
Be ruled by m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, forget to think of her.

ROMEO:
O, teach me how[SEQ_SPLITTER] I should forget to think.

BENVOLIO:
By giving li[SEQ_SPLITTER]berty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.

RO[SEQ_SPLITTER]MEO:
'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in quest[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion more:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies'[SEQ_SPLITTER] brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ecious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]stress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty [SEQ_SPLITTER]serve, but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to forget.

BENVOLIO:
I'll pay that doctrine, or[SEQ_SPLITTER] else die in debt.

CAPULET:
But Montague is bound[SEQ_SPLITTER] as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard[SEQ_SPLITTER], I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PARIS:
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
But now, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET:
But sayin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a [SEQ_SPLITTER]stranger in the world;
She hath not seen the chang[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of fourteen years,
Let two more summers wither i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ride.

PARIS:
Younger than she are happy mothers m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ade.

CAPULET:
And too soon marr'd are those so ea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rly made.
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]o her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her[SEQ_SPLITTER] consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her s[SEQ_SPLITTER]cope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according [SEQ_SPLITTER]voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcom[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to [SEQ_SPLITTER]behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young m[SEQ_SPLITTER]en feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of [SEQ_SPLITTER]limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fre[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my [SEQ_SPLITTER]house; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose [SEQ_SPLITTER]merit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ine being one
May stand in number, though in recko[SEQ_SPLITTER]ning none,
Come, go with me.
Go, sirrah, trudge ab[SEQ_SPLITTER]out
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ose names are written there, and to them say,
My h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ouse and welcome on their pleasure stay.

Servant:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Find them out whose names are written here! It is[SEQ_SPLITTER]
written, that the shoemaker should meddle with hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but[SEQ_SPLITTER] I am
sent to find those persons whose names are h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere
writ, and can never find what names the writin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--I[SEQ_SPLITTER]n good time.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, man, one fire burns o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by anot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward[SEQ_SPLITTER] turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's[SEQ_SPLITTER] languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye[SEQ_SPLITTER],
And the rank poison of the old will die.

ROMEO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

BENVO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LIO:
For what, I pray thee?

ROMEO:
For your broke[SEQ_SPLITTER]n shin.

BENVOLIO:
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

ROME[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Shut[SEQ_SPLITTER] up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ormented and--God-den, good fellow.

Servant:
God [SEQ_SPLITTER]gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

ROMEO:
Ay[SEQ_SPLITTER], mine own fortune in my misery.

Servant:
Perhaps[SEQ_SPLITTER] you have learned it without book: but, I
pray, ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]n you read any thing you see?

ROMEO:
Ay, if I kno[SEQ_SPLITTER]w the letters and the language.

Servant:
Ye say h[SEQ_SPLITTER]onestly: rest you merry!

ROMEO:
Stay, fellow; I c[SEQ_SPLITTER]an read.
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughte[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs;
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the [SEQ_SPLITTER]lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his [SEQ_SPLITTER]lovely
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine;[SEQ_SPLITTER] mine
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir niece
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his[SEQ_SPLITTER] cousin
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir
assembly: whither should they come?

Servant:
U[SEQ_SPLITTER]p.

ROMEO:
Whither?

Servant:
To supper; to our ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]use.

ROMEO:
Whose house?

Servant:
My master's.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]ROMEO:
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before[SEQ_SPLITTER].

Servant:
Now I'll tell you without asking: my m[SEQ_SPLITTER]aster is the
great rich Capulet; and if you be not[SEQ_SPLITTER] of the house
of Montagues, I pray, come and crush[SEQ_SPLITTER] a cup of wine.
Rest you merry!

BENVOLIO:
At this[SEQ_SPLITTER] same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Ros[SEQ_SPLITTER]aline whom thou so lovest,
With all the admired be[SEQ_SPLITTER]auties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainte[SEQ_SPLITTER]d eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

RO[SEQ_SPLITTER]MEO:
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintain[SEQ_SPLITTER]s such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ese, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparen[SEQ_SPLITTER]t heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my[SEQ_SPLITTER] love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match sinc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e first the world begun.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you saw h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with h[SEQ_SPLITTER]erself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales l[SEQ_SPLITTER]et there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some [SEQ_SPLITTER]other maid
That I will show you shining at this fe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows [SEQ_SPLITTER]best.

ROMEO:
I'll go along, no such sight to be s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hown,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

LAD[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y CAPULET:
Nurse, where's my daughter? call her fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rth to me.

Nurse:
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e year old,
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, lad[SEQ_SPLITTER]ybird!
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

JULIET:
How now! who calls?

Nurse:
Your mother[SEQ_SPLITTER].

JULIET:
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ADY CAPULET:
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e awhile,
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come bac[SEQ_SPLITTER]k again;
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]nsel.
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Nurse:
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ADY CAPULET:
She's not fourteen.

Nurse:
I'll lay [SEQ_SPLITTER]fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teeth be it[SEQ_SPLITTER] spoken, I have but four--
She is not fourteen. Ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET:
A [SEQ_SPLITTER]fortnight and odd days.

Nurse:
Even or odd, of al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall[SEQ_SPLITTER] she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Chri[SEQ_SPLITTER]stian souls!--
Were of an age: well, Susan is with[SEQ_SPLITTER] God;
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
On [SEQ_SPLITTER]Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the[SEQ_SPLITTER] earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd,-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-I never shall forget it,--
Of all the days of the[SEQ_SPLITTER] year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood[SEQ_SPLITTER] to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-hous[SEQ_SPLITTER]e wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Nay[SEQ_SPLITTER], I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
When it did [SEQ_SPLITTER]taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and fel[SEQ_SPLITTER]t it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l out with the dug!
Shake quoth the dove-house: 't[SEQ_SPLITTER]was no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat time it is eleven years;
For then she could st[SEQ_SPLITTER]and alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d waddled all about;
For even the day before, she [SEQ_SPLITTER]broke her brow:
And then my husband--God be with h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is soul!
A' was a merry man--took up the child:
'Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty w[SEQ_SPLITTER]retch left crying and said 'Ay.'
To see, now, how [SEQ_SPLITTER]a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve a thousand years,
I never should forget it: 'Wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]lt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it[SEQ_SPLITTER] stinted and said 'Ay.'

LADY CAPULET:
Enough of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

Nurse:
Yes, mad[SEQ_SPLITTER]am: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld leave crying and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant,[SEQ_SPLITTER] it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young coc[SEQ_SPLITTER]kerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitte[SEQ_SPLITTER]rly:
'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy fac[SEQ_SPLITTER]e?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age[SEQ_SPLITTER];
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
JULIET:
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay I.

Nurse:
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to[SEQ_SPLITTER] his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er[SEQ_SPLITTER] I nursed:
An I might live to see thee married onc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
I have my wish.

LADY CAPULET:
Marry, that 'mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry' is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, [SEQ_SPLITTER]daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be[SEQ_SPLITTER] married?

JULIET:
It is an honour that I dream no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of.

Nurse:
An honour! were not I thine only nur[SEQ_SPLITTER]se,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy [SEQ_SPLITTER]teat.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, think of marriage now; [SEQ_SPLITTER]younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Are made already mothers: by my count,
I was you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r mother much upon these years
That you are now a [SEQ_SPLITTER]maid. Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks [SEQ_SPLITTER]you for his love.

Nurse:
A man, young lady! lady,[SEQ_SPLITTER] such a man
As all the world--why, he's a man of w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ax.

LADY CAPULET:
Verona's summer hath not such a[SEQ_SPLITTER] flower.

Nurse:
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ery flower.

LADY CAPULET:
What say you? can you l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him[SEQ_SPLITTER] at our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris[SEQ_SPLITTER]' face,
And find delight writ there with beauty's [SEQ_SPLITTER]pen;
Examine every married lineament,
And see how [SEQ_SPLITTER]one another lends content
And what obscured in thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of [SEQ_SPLITTER]his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound[SEQ_SPLITTER] lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair[SEQ_SPLITTER] without the fair within to hide:
That book in man[SEQ_SPLITTER]y's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps[SEQ_SPLITTER] locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all[SEQ_SPLITTER] that he doth possess,
By having him, making yours[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf no less.

Nurse:
No less! nay, bigger; women g[SEQ_SPLITTER]row by men.

LADY CAPULET:
Speak briefly, can you [SEQ_SPLITTER]like of Paris' love?

JULIET:
I'll look to like, i[SEQ_SPLITTER]f looking liking move:
But no more deep will I end[SEQ_SPLITTER]art mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake it fly.

Servant:
Madam, the guests are come, [SEQ_SPLITTER]supper served up, you
called, my young lady asked [SEQ_SPLITTER]for, the nurse cursed in
the pantry, and every thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng in extremity. I must
hence to wait; I beseech y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou, follow straight.

LADY CAPULET:
We follow thee[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Juliet, the county stays.

Nurse:
Go, girl, seek[SEQ_SPLITTER] happy nights to happy days.

ROMEO:
What, shall t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on[SEQ_SPLITTER] without a apology?

BENVOLIO:
The date is out of [SEQ_SPLITTER]such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hout-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompt[SEQ_SPLITTER]er, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat they will;
We'll measure them a measure, and b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e gone.

ROMEO:
Give me a torch: I am not for this[SEQ_SPLITTER] ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
MERCUTIO:
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce.

ROMEO:
Not I, believe me: you have dancing sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]oes
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
So st[SEQ_SPLITTER]akes me to the ground I cannot move.

MERCUTIO:
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with[SEQ_SPLITTER] them above a common bound.

ROMEO:
I am too sore [SEQ_SPLITTER]enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light fe[SEQ_SPLITTER]athers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above[SEQ_SPLITTER] dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ERCUTIO:
And, to sink in it, should you burden lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

ROMEO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rud[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

MERC[SEQ_SPLITTER]UTIO:
If love be rough with you, be rough with lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Give me a case to put my visage in:
A visor for [SEQ_SPLITTER]a visor! what care I
What curious eye doth quote d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush [SEQ_SPLITTER]for me.

BENVOLIO:
Come, knock and enter; and no s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ooner in,
But every man betake him to his legs.

R[SEQ_SPLITTER]OMEO:
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]ickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
For I[SEQ_SPLITTER] am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a c[SEQ_SPLITTER]andle-holder, and look on.
The game was ne'er so f[SEQ_SPLITTER]air, and I am done.

MERCUTIO:
Tut, dun's the mous[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, the constable's own word:
If thou art dun, we'l[SEQ_SPLITTER]l draw thee from the mire
Of this sir-reverence lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve, wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we[SEQ_SPLITTER] burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO:
Nay, that's not so.

M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ERCUTIO:
I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights[SEQ_SPLITTER] in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning[SEQ_SPLITTER], for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere onc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e in our five wits.

ROMEO:
And we mean well in go[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go.

MERCUTIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO:
I dream'd a dream to-n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight.

MERCUTIO:
And so did I.

ROMEO:
Well, what [SEQ_SPLITTER]was yours?

MERCUTIO:
That dreamers often lie.

RO[SEQ_SPLITTER]MEO:
In bed asleep, while they do dream things tru[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

MERCUTIO:
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she come[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of lit[SEQ_SPLITTER]tle atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep[SEQ_SPLITTER];
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of[SEQ_SPLITTER] the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone,[SEQ_SPLITTER] the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated[SEQ_SPLITTER] gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an e[SEQ_SPLITTER]mpty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old [SEQ_SPLITTER]grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd in this state she gallops night by night
Throug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'e[SEQ_SPLITTER]r courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies strai[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on [SEQ_SPLITTER]fees,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plague[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted a[SEQ_SPLITTER]re:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And some[SEQ_SPLITTER]time comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Tickling a [SEQ_SPLITTER]parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Then dreams, he o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a so[SEQ_SPLITTER]ldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreig[SEQ_SPLITTER]n throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blade[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drum[SEQ_SPLITTER]s in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And be[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleep[SEQ_SPLITTER]s again. This is that very Mab
That plats the mane[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of horses in the night,
And bakes the elflocks i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n foul sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled, much [SEQ_SPLITTER]misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie [SEQ_SPLITTER]on their backs,
That presses them and learns them [SEQ_SPLITTER]first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
This is she--

ROMEO:
Peace, peace, Mercutio, pea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce!
Thou talk'st of nothing.

MERCUTIO:
True, I ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]lk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle br[SEQ_SPLITTER]ain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant[SEQ_SPLITTER] than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen boso[SEQ_SPLITTER]m of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping sou[SEQ_SPLITTER]th.

BENVOLIO:
This wind, you talk of, blows us fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come to[SEQ_SPLITTER]o late.

ROMEO:
I fear, too early: for my mind mis[SEQ_SPLITTER]gives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all bitterly begin his fearful date
With this nigh[SEQ_SPLITTER]t's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life [SEQ_SPLITTER]closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untime[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly death.
But He, that hath the steerage of my cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rse,
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

BENVOLI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
Strike, drum.

First Servant:
Where's Potpan, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat he helps not to take away? He
shift a trencher[SEQ_SPLITTER]? he scrape a trencher!

Second Servant:
When good[SEQ_SPLITTER] manners shall lie all in one or two men's
hands a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

First Se[SEQ_SPLITTER]rvant:
Away with the joint-stools, remove the
cour[SEQ_SPLITTER]t-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
me [SEQ_SPLITTER]a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
[SEQ_SPLITTER]the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Anton[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, and Potpan!

Second Servant:
Ay, boy, ready.

F[SEQ_SPLITTER]irst Servant:
You are looked for and called for, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]sked for and
sought for, in the great chamber.

Se[SEQ_SPLITTER]cond Servant:
We cannot be here and there too. Che[SEQ_SPLITTER]erly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the longer liver [SEQ_SPLITTER]take all.

CAPULET:
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have a[SEQ_SPLITTER] bout with you.
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you[SEQ_SPLITTER] all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty[SEQ_SPLITTER],
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tal[SEQ_SPLITTER]e in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please: 'tis[SEQ_SPLITTER] gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gent[SEQ_SPLITTER]lemen! come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give[SEQ_SPLITTER] room! and foot it, girls.
More light, you knaves;[SEQ_SPLITTER] and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the [SEQ_SPLITTER]room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cous[SEQ_SPLITTER]in Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing day[SEQ_SPLITTER]s:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Wer[SEQ_SPLITTER]e in a mask?

Second Capulet:
By'r lady, thirty ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]ars.

CAPULET:
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot so much:
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and[SEQ_SPLITTER] twenty years; and then we mask'd.

Second Capulet[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
His[SEQ_SPLITTER] son is thirty.

CAPULET:
Will you tell me that?
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]is son was but a ward two years ago.

ROMEO:

Serv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ant:
I know not, sir.

ROMEO:
O, she doth teach th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon [SEQ_SPLITTER]the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As y[SEQ_SPLITTER]onder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure don[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching he[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true [SEQ_SPLITTER]beauty till this night.

TYBALT:
This, by his voic[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. [SEQ_SPLITTER]What dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an [SEQ_SPLITTER]antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im dead, I hold it not a sin.

CAPULET:
Why, how n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT:
Uncl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is [SEQ_SPLITTER]hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is night.

CAPULET:
Young Romeo is it?

TYBALT:
'T[SEQ_SPLITTER]is he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET:
Content thee,[SEQ_SPLITTER] gentle coz, let him alone;
He bears him like a po[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of[SEQ_SPLITTER] him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my[SEQ_SPLITTER] house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient,[SEQ_SPLITTER] take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off the[SEQ_SPLITTER]se frowns,
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast[SEQ_SPLITTER].

TYBALT:
It fits, when such a villain is a guest[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I'll not endure him.

CAPULET:
He shall be endur[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am [SEQ_SPLITTER]I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endur[SEQ_SPLITTER]e him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutin[SEQ_SPLITTER]y among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'l[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be the man!

TYBALT:
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]CAPULET:
Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is't s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be q[SEQ_SPLITTER]uiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
I'll [SEQ_SPLITTER]make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

TYBALT:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Make[SEQ_SPLITTER]s my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seemin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g sweet convert to bitter gall.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
G[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have[SEQ_SPLITTER] hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to [SEQ_SPLITTER]palm is holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO:
Have not saint[SEQ_SPLITTER]s lips, and holy palmers too?

JULIET:
Ay, pilgrim[SEQ_SPLITTER], lips that they must use in prayer.

ROMEO:
O, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]en, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIE[SEQ_SPLITTER]T:
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake.

ROMEO:
Then move not, while my prayer's effe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ct I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is [SEQ_SPLITTER]purged.

JULIET:
Then have my lips the sin that th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey have took.

ROMEO:
Sin from thy lips? O trespas[SEQ_SPLITTER]s sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.

JULIET:
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u kiss by the book.

Nurse:
Madam, your mother cra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ves a word with you.

ROMEO:
What is her mother?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Nurse:
Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of [SEQ_SPLITTER]the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have [SEQ_SPLITTER]the chinks.

ROMEO:
Is she a Capulet?
O dear accou[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt! my life is my foe's debt.

BENVOLIO:
Away, beg[SEQ_SPLITTER]one; the sport is at the best.

ROMEO:
Ay, so I fe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar; the more is my unrest.

CAPULET:
Nay, gentleme[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling fool[SEQ_SPLITTER]ish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hank you all
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight.
More torches here! Come on then, let's to be[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
I'll to m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y rest.

JULIET:
Come hither, nurse. What is yond [SEQ_SPLITTER]gentleman?

Nurse:
The son and heir of old Tiberio[SEQ_SPLITTER].

JULIET:
What's he that now is going out of door[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

Nurse:
Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

JULIET:
What's he that follows there, that would[SEQ_SPLITTER] not dance?

Nurse:
I know not.

JULIET:
Go ask hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s name: if he be married.
My grave is like to be m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y wedding bed.

Nurse:
His name is Romeo, and a Mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntague;
The only son of your great enemy.

JULIET:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early [SEQ_SPLITTER]seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth[SEQ_SPLITTER] of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed e[SEQ_SPLITTER]nemy.

Nurse:
What's this? what's this?

JULIET:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER] rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Nurse:
Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the stranger[SEQ_SPLITTER]s all are gone.

Chorus:
Now old desire doth in hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s death-bed lie,
And young affection gapes to be h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is heir;
That fair for which love groan'd for and [SEQ_SPLITTER]would die,
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not [SEQ_SPLITTER]fair.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
Alike [SEQ_SPLITTER]betwitched by the charm of looks,
But to his foe s[SEQ_SPLITTER]upposed he must complain,
And she steal love's swe[SEQ_SPLITTER]et bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers [SEQ_SPLITTER]use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means m[SEQ_SPLITTER]uch less
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssion lends them power, time means, to meet
Temper[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing extremities with extreme sweet.

ROMEO:
Can I [SEQ_SPLITTER]go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull [SEQ_SPLITTER]earth, and find thy centre out.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo! [SEQ_SPLITTER]my cousin Romeo!

MERCUTIO:
He is wise;
And, on my[SEQ_SPLITTER] lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.

BENVOLIO:
He r[SEQ_SPLITTER]an this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood Mercutio.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]meo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but '[SEQ_SPLITTER]love' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus one fai[SEQ_SPLITTER]r word,
One nick-name for her purblind son and hei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
When Ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not,[SEQ_SPLITTER] he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarl[SEQ_SPLITTER]et lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg and quiveri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

BENVOLIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

MERCU[SEQ_SPLITTER]TIO:
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
To r[SEQ_SPLITTER]aise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some stra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nge nature, letting it there stand
Till she had la[SEQ_SPLITTER]id it and conjured it down;
That were some spite: [SEQ_SPLITTER]my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his mistr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess' name
I conjure only but to raise up him.

BEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]VOLIO:
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees[SEQ_SPLITTER],
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s his love and best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO:
If[SEQ_SPLITTER] love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will[SEQ_SPLITTER] he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress[SEQ_SPLITTER] were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]en they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she were, O, that[SEQ_SPLITTER] she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear![SEQ_SPLITTER]
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
This f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ield-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall [SEQ_SPLITTER]we go?

BENVOLIO:
Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To se[SEQ_SPLITTER]ek him here that means not to be found.

ROMEO:
He[SEQ_SPLITTER] jests at scars that never felt a wound.
But, soft[SEQ_SPLITTER]! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and [SEQ_SPLITTER]pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more f[SEQ_SPLITTER]air than she:
Be not her maid, since she is enviou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And non[SEQ_SPLITTER]e but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady[SEQ_SPLITTER], O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She[SEQ_SPLITTER] speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her ey[SEQ_SPLITTER]e discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]s not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat[SEQ_SPLITTER] her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they re[SEQ_SPLITTER]turn.
What if her eyes were there, they in her hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]d?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Would through the airy region stream so bright
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t birds would sing and think it were not night.
Se[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that [SEQ_SPLITTER]I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch [SEQ_SPLITTER]that cheek!

JULIET:
Ay me!

ROMEO:
She speaks:
O,[SEQ_SPLITTER] speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorio[SEQ_SPLITTER]us to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winge[SEQ_SPLITTER]d messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wond[SEQ_SPLITTER]ering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sai[SEQ_SPLITTER]ls upon the bosom of the air.

JULIET:
O Romeo, Ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]meo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and[SEQ_SPLITTER] refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but swo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

ROME[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:

JULIET:
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Mont[SEQ_SPLITTER]ague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face,[SEQ_SPLITTER] nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some[SEQ_SPLITTER] other name!
What's in a name? that which we call [SEQ_SPLITTER]a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So [SEQ_SPLITTER]Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that[SEQ_SPLITTER] dear perfection which he owes
Without that title.[SEQ_SPLITTER] Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is [SEQ_SPLITTER]no part of thee
Take all myself.

ROMEO:
I take th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new [SEQ_SPLITTER]baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

JULIE[SEQ_SPLITTER]T:
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night[SEQ_SPLITTER]
So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO:
By a name
I k[SEQ_SPLITTER]now not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear s[SEQ_SPLITTER]aint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy[SEQ_SPLITTER] to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

JULIET:
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred wor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the soun[SEQ_SPLITTER]d:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

ROMEO:
Neit[SEQ_SPLITTER]her, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e place death, considering who thou art,
If any of[SEQ_SPLITTER] my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO:
With love's li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony [SEQ_SPLITTER]limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do [SEQ_SPLITTER]that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are[SEQ_SPLITTER] no let to me.

JULIET:
If they do see thee, they [SEQ_SPLITTER]will murder thee.

ROMEO:
Alack, there lies more p[SEQ_SPLITTER]eril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords: loo[SEQ_SPLITTER]k thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enm[SEQ_SPLITTER]ity.

JULIET:
I would not for the world they saw t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee here.

ROMEO:
I have night's cloak to hide me [SEQ_SPLITTER]from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ind me here:
My life were better ended by their ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]te,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

JU[SEQ_SPLITTER]LIET:
By whose direction found'st thou out this pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace?

ROMEO:
By love, who first did prompt me to i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventur[SEQ_SPLITTER]e for such merchandise.

JULIET:
Thou know'st the [SEQ_SPLITTER]mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden b[SEQ_SPLITTER]lush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell com[SEQ_SPLITTER]pliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say '[SEQ_SPLITTER]Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear's[SEQ_SPLITTER]t,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]en say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost [SEQ_SPLITTER]love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st[SEQ_SPLITTER] I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse [SEQ_SPLITTER]an say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior ligh[SEQ_SPLITTER]t:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]han those that have more cunning to be strange.
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]should have been more strange, I must confess,
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute[SEQ_SPLITTER] this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath so discovered.

ROMEO:
Lady, by yonder bless[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]uit-tree tops--

JULIET:
O, swear not by the moon,[SEQ_SPLITTER] the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her [SEQ_SPLITTER]circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise var[SEQ_SPLITTER]iable.

ROMEO:
What shall I swear by?

JULIET:
Do [SEQ_SPLITTER]not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy g[SEQ_SPLITTER]racious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] I'll believe thee.

ROMEO:
If my heart's dear lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e--

JULIET:
Well, do not swear: although I joy in[SEQ_SPLITTER] thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It[SEQ_SPLITTER] is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like [SEQ_SPLITTER]the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can [SEQ_SPLITTER]say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of [SEQ_SPLITTER]love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a bea[SEQ_SPLITTER]uteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good [SEQ_SPLITTER]night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart [SEQ_SPLITTER]as that within my breast!

ROMEO:
O, wilt thou lea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve me so unsatisfied?

JULIET:
What satisfaction c[SEQ_SPLITTER]anst thou have to-night?

ROMEO:
The exchange of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy love's faithful vow for mine.

JULIET:
I gave t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould it were to give again.

ROMEO:
Wouldst thou w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ithdraw it? for what purpose, love?

JULIET:
But t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish[SEQ_SPLITTER] but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundle[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to[SEQ_SPLITTER] thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
I h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a littl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, I will come again.

ROMEO:
O blessed, blessed n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but[SEQ_SPLITTER] a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
JULIET:
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night i[SEQ_SPLITTER]ndeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one [SEQ_SPLITTER]that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what [SEQ_SPLITTER]time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortun[SEQ_SPLITTER]es at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord th[SEQ_SPLITTER]roughout the world.

Nurse:

JULIET:
I come, anon.[SEQ_SPLITTER]--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-

Nurse:

JULIET:
By and by, I come:--
To cease t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will [SEQ_SPLITTER]I send.

ROMEO:
So thrive my soul--

JULIET:
A tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]usand times good night!

ROMEO:
A thousand times t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love[SEQ_SPLITTER], as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve, toward school with heavy looks.

JULIET:
Hist![SEQ_SPLITTER] Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave[SEQ_SPLITTER] where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]arse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name[SEQ_SPLITTER].

ROMEO:
It is my soul that calls upon my name:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke softest music to attending ears!

JULIET:
Romeo[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

ROMEO:
My dear?

JULIET:
At what o'clock to-mor[SEQ_SPLITTER]row
Shall I send to thee?

ROMEO:
At the hour of n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ine.

JULIET:
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ROMEO:
Let me stand here till thou remember it.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]JULIET:
I shall forget, to have thee still stand t[SEQ_SPLITTER]here,
Remembering how I love thy company.

ROMEO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rgetting any other home but this.

JULIET:
'Tis al[SEQ_SPLITTER]most morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no f[SEQ_SPLITTER]urther than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a lit[SEQ_SPLITTER]tle from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back [SEQ_SPLITTER]again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

ROMEO:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] would I were thy bird.

JULIET:
Sweet, so would I[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d night, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

R[SEQ_SPLITTER]OMEO:
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy br[SEQ_SPLITTER]east!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to re[SEQ_SPLITTER]st!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His [SEQ_SPLITTER]help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

FRIAR LAU[SEQ_SPLITTER]RENCE:
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f light,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reel[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day [SEQ_SPLITTER]to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and [SEQ_SPLITTER]precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's[SEQ_SPLITTER] mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t is her womb,
And from her womb children of diver[SEQ_SPLITTER]s kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many [SEQ_SPLITTER]for many virtues excellent,
None but for some and [SEQ_SPLITTER]yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace[SEQ_SPLITTER] that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their tru[SEQ_SPLITTER]e qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth [SEQ_SPLITTER]doth live
But to the earth some special good doth [SEQ_SPLITTER]give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fai[SEQ_SPLITTER]r use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infa[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence[SEQ_SPLITTER] and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all[SEQ_SPLITTER] senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings enc[SEQ_SPLITTER]amp them still
In man as well as herbs, grace and [SEQ_SPLITTER]rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Fu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll soon the canker death eats up that plant.

ROME[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
Good morrow, father.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Benedicit[SEQ_SPLITTER]e!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young s[SEQ_SPLITTER]on, it argues a distemper'd head
So soon to bid go[SEQ_SPLITTER]od morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in ever[SEQ_SPLITTER]y old man's eye,
And where care lodges, sleep will[SEQ_SPLITTER] never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep [SEQ_SPLITTER]doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Or if [SEQ_SPLITTER]not so, then here I hit it right,
Our Romeo hath n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot been in bed to-night.

ROMEO:
That last is true[SEQ_SPLITTER]; the sweeter rest was mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
God [SEQ_SPLITTER]pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?

ROMEO:
With [SEQ_SPLITTER]Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
I have forgot tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t name, and that name's woe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
That[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s my good son: but where hast thou been, then?

R[SEQ_SPLITTER]OMEO:
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sud[SEQ_SPLITTER]den one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: bot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lie[SEQ_SPLITTER]s:
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
My inte[SEQ_SPLITTER]rcession likewise steads my foe.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing confession finds but riddling shrift.

ROMEO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers,[SEQ_SPLITTER] so hers is set on mine;
And all combined, save wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at thou must combine
By holy marriage: when and wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere and how
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of [SEQ_SPLITTER]vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat thou consent to marry us to-day.

FRIAR LAUREN[SEQ_SPLITTER]CE:
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
Is [SEQ_SPLITTER]Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
So soon fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rsaken? young men's love then lies
Not truly in th[SEQ_SPLITTER]eir hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a [SEQ_SPLITTER]deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]saline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun[SEQ_SPLITTER] not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old gro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ans ring yet in my ancient ears;
Lo, here upon thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hese woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for [SEQ_SPLITTER]Rosaline:
And art thou changed? pronounce this sen[SEQ_SPLITTER]tence then,
Women may fall, when there's no streng[SEQ_SPLITTER]th in men.

ROMEO:
Thou chid'st me oft for loving [SEQ_SPLITTER]Rosaline.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
For doting, not for lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing, pupil mine.

ROMEO:
And bad'st me bury love.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Not in a grave,
To lay one in, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]other out to have.

ROMEO:
I pray thee, chide not;[SEQ_SPLITTER] she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love[SEQ_SPLITTER] for love allow;
The other did not so.

FRIAR LAUR[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENCE:
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come,[SEQ_SPLITTER] go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r households' rancour to pure love.

ROMEO:
O, let[SEQ_SPLITTER] us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

FRIAR LAURENC[SEQ_SPLITTER]E:
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ERCUTIO:
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Cam[SEQ_SPLITTER]e he not home to-night?

BENVOLIO:
Not to his fath[SEQ_SPLITTER]er's; I spoke with his man.

MERCUTIO:
Ah, that sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]me pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torment[SEQ_SPLITTER]s him so, that he will sure run mad.

BENVOLIO:
Ty[SEQ_SPLITTER]balt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent a lett[SEQ_SPLITTER]er to his father's house.

MERCUTIO:
A challenge, [SEQ_SPLITTER]on my life.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo will answer it.

MERC[SEQ_SPLITTER]UTIO:
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BENVOLIO:
Nay, he will answer the letter's master[SEQ_SPLITTER], how he
dares, being dared.

MERCUTIO:
Alas poor [SEQ_SPLITTER]Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
white we[SEQ_SPLITTER]nch's black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-[SEQ_SPLITTER]song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
bli[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encoun[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO:
Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCU[SEQ_SPLITTER]TIO:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, [SEQ_SPLITTER]he is
the courageous captain of compliments. He fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghts as
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two[SEQ_SPLITTER], and
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of[SEQ_SPLITTER] a silk
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentlema[SEQ_SPLITTER]n of the
very first house, of the first and second[SEQ_SPLITTER] cause:
ah, the immortal passado! the punto revers[SEQ_SPLITTER]o! the
hai!

BENVOLIO:
The what?

MERCUTIO:
The po[SEQ_SPLITTER]x of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; [SEQ_SPLITTER]these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good[SEQ_SPLITTER] blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, [SEQ_SPLITTER]is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we[SEQ_SPLITTER] should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies[SEQ_SPLITTER], these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi's, who s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tand so much on the new form,
that they cannot at [SEQ_SPLITTER]ease on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

BENVOLIO:
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MERCUTIO:
Without his roe, like a dried herring: f[SEQ_SPLITTER]lesh, flesh,
how art thou fishified! Now is he for[SEQ_SPLITTER] the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his[SEQ_SPLITTER] lady was but a
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a be[SEQ_SPLITTER]tter love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra[SEQ_SPLITTER] a gipsy;
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sbe a grey
eye or so, but not to the purpose. Sign[SEQ_SPLITTER]ior
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]irly last night.

ROMEO:
Good morrow to you both. [SEQ_SPLITTER]What counterfeit did I give you?

MERCUTIO:
The sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ip, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

ROMEO:
P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MERCUTIO:
That's as much as to say, such a case as[SEQ_SPLITTER] yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.

ROMEO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Meaning, to court'sy.

MERCUTIO:
Thou hast most [SEQ_SPLITTER]kindly hit it.

ROMEO:
A most courteous exposition[SEQ_SPLITTER].

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ROMEO:
Pink for flower.

MERCUTIO:
Right.

ROMEO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Why, then is my pump well flowered.

MERCUTIO:
We[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole[SEQ_SPLITTER] singular.

ROMEO:
O single-soled jest, solely sin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gular for the
singleness.

MERCUTIO:
Come between [SEQ_SPLITTER]us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

ROMEO:
Switch a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MERCUTIO:
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chas[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, I have
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]se in one of
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y whole five:
was I with you there for the goose?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ROMEO:
Thou wast never with me for any thing when[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou wast
not there for the goose.

MERCUTIO:
I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill bite thee by the ear for that jest.

ROMEO:
Na[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, good goose, bite not.

MERCUTIO:
Thy wit is a v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ery bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.

RO[SEQ_SPLITTER]MEO:
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

MERCUTIO:
O here's a wit of cheveril, that stre[SEQ_SPLITTER]tches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!

ROMEO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which add[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad [SEQ_SPLITTER]goose.

MERCUTIO:
Why, is not this better now than[SEQ_SPLITTER] groaning for love?
now art thou sociable, now art[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art, by art as[SEQ_SPLITTER] well as by nature:
for this drivelling love is li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down [SEQ_SPLITTER]to hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO:
Stop ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, stop there.

MERCUTIO:
Thou desirest me to stop[SEQ_SPLITTER] in my tale against the hair.

BENVOLIO:
Thou woul[SEQ_SPLITTER]dst else have made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO:
O, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou art deceived; I would have made it short:
for [SEQ_SPLITTER]I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
mean[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.

ROME[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
Here's goodly gear!

MERCUTIO:
A sail, a sail!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BENVOLIO:
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

Nurse:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Peter!

PETER:
Anon!

Nurse:
My fan, Peter.

MERCU[SEQ_SPLITTER]TIO:
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he
fairer face.

Nurse:
God ye good morrow, gentle[SEQ_SPLITTER]men.

MERCUTIO:
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Nurse:
Is it good den?

MERCUTIO:
'Tis no less, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now [SEQ_SPLITTER]upon the prick of noon.

Nurse:
Out upon you! what[SEQ_SPLITTER] a man are you!

ROMEO:
One, gentlewoman, that God[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath made for himself to
mar.

Nurse:
By my troth[SEQ_SPLITTER], it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
quoth a'?[SEQ_SPLITTER] Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
may fin[SEQ_SPLITTER]d the young Romeo?

ROMEO:
I can tell you; but you[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng Romeo will be older when
you have found him tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest of[SEQ_SPLITTER] that name, for fault of a worse.

Nurse:
You say [SEQ_SPLITTER]well.

MERCUTIO:
Yea, is the worst well? very well[SEQ_SPLITTER] took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely.

Nurse:
if you be[SEQ_SPLITTER] he, sir, I desire some confidence with
you.

BENV[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLIO:
She will indite him to some supper.

MERCUTI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

ROMEO:
What has[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thou found?

MERCUTIO:
No hare, sir; unless a ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]re, sir, in a lenten pie,
that is something stale [SEQ_SPLITTER]and hoar ere it be spent.
An old hare hoar,
And an[SEQ_SPLITTER] old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in lent
But a ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]re that is hoar
Is too much for a score,
When it h[SEQ_SPLITTER]oars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your[SEQ_SPLITTER] father's? we'll
to dinner, thither.

ROMEO:
I wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l follow you.

MERCUTIO:
Farewell, ancient lady; f[SEQ_SPLITTER]arewell,
'lady, lady, lady.'

Nurse:
Marry, farewe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll! I pray you, sir, what saucy
merchant was this,[SEQ_SPLITTER] that was so full of his ropery?

ROMEO:
A gentlem[SEQ_SPLITTER]an, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
and wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll speak more in a minute than he will stand
to in[SEQ_SPLITTER] a month.

Nurse:
An a' speak any thing against me[SEQ_SPLITTER], I'll take him
down, an a' were lustier than he i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, and twenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd those that shall.
Scurvy knave! I am none of hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou must stand by
too, and suffer every knave to [SEQ_SPLITTER]use me at his pleasure?

PETER:
I saw no man use y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
should quickly [SEQ_SPLITTER]have been out, I warrant you: I dare
draw as soon [SEQ_SPLITTER]as another man, if I see occasion in a
good quarre[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, and the law on my side.

Nurse:
Now, afore God,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I am so vexed, that every part about
me quivers. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
and as I told[SEQ_SPLITTER] you, my young lady bade me inquire you
out; what [SEQ_SPLITTER]she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
but first [SEQ_SPLITTER]let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
a fool'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
kind[SEQ_SPLITTER] of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
is [SEQ_SPLITTER]young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
[SEQ_SPLITTER]to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

ROMEO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]test unto thee--

Nurse:
Good heart, and, i' faith[SEQ_SPLITTER], I will tell her as much:
Lord, Lord, she will be[SEQ_SPLITTER] a joyful woman.

ROMEO:
What wilt thou tell her, [SEQ_SPLITTER]nurse? thou dost not mark me.

Nurse:
I will tell [SEQ_SPLITTER]her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
I take it[SEQ_SPLITTER], is a gentlemanlike offer.

ROMEO:
Bid her devise[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shrived[SEQ_SPLITTER] and married. Here is for thy pains.

Nurse:
No tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]uly sir; not a penny.

ROMEO:
Go to; I say you sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll.

Nurse:
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e there.

ROMEO:
And stay, good nurse, behind the [SEQ_SPLITTER]abbey wall:
Within this hour my man shall be with [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stai[SEQ_SPLITTER]r;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be[SEQ_SPLITTER] my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be trust[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell; commend me t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o thy mistress.

Nurse:
Now God in heaven bless th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee! Hark you, sir.

ROMEO:
What say'st thou, my de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar nurse?

Nurse:
Is your man secret? Did you ne'e[SEQ_SPLITTER]r hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

ROMEO:
I warrant thee, my man's as true as stee[SEQ_SPLITTER]l.

NURSE:
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest [SEQ_SPLITTER]lady--Lord,
Lord! when 'twas a little prating thin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g:--O, there
is a nobleman in town, one Paris, tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t would fain
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul,[SEQ_SPLITTER] had as lief
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. [SEQ_SPLITTER]I anger her
sometimes and tell her that Paris is t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he properer
man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say[SEQ_SPLITTER] so, she looks
as pale as any clout in the versal [SEQ_SPLITTER]world. Doth not
rosemary and Romeo begin both with[SEQ_SPLITTER] a letter?

ROMEO:
Ay, nurse; what of that? both w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith an R.

Nurse:
Ah. mocker! that's the dog's nam[SEQ_SPLITTER]e; R is for
the--No; I know it begins with some ot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her
letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententiou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of
it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you[SEQ_SPLITTER] good
to hear it.

ROMEO:
Commend me to thy lady.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Nurse:
Ay, a thousand times.
Peter!

PETER:
Anon![SEQ_SPLITTER]

Nurse:
Peter, take my fan, and go before and apa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce.

JULIET:
The clock struck nine when I did send[SEQ_SPLITTER] the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
O,[SEQ_SPLITTER] she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hich ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Therefore[SEQ_SPLITTER] do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And therefore[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun u[SEQ_SPLITTER]pon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she [SEQ_SPLITTER]is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful [SEQ_SPLITTER]blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his[SEQ_SPLITTER] to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]d;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, [SEQ_SPLITTER]she comes!
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met[SEQ_SPLITTER] with him? Send thy man away.

Nurse:
Peter, stay [SEQ_SPLITTER]at the gate.

JULIET:
Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd, why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet [SEQ_SPLITTER]tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the music[SEQ_SPLITTER] of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a [SEQ_SPLITTER]face.

Nurse:
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

[SEQ_SPLITTER]JULIET:
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy new[SEQ_SPLITTER]s:
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse[SEQ_SPLITTER], speak.

Nurse:
Jesu, what haste? can you not sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]y awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
JULIET:
How art thou out of breath, when thou has[SEQ_SPLITTER]t breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is l[SEQ_SPLITTER]onger than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news [SEQ_SPLITTER]good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll[SEQ_SPLITTER] stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is't [SEQ_SPLITTER]good or bad?

Nurse:
Well, you have made a simple [SEQ_SPLITTER]choice; you know not
how to choose a man: Romeo! n[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, not he; though his
face be better than any man'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, yet his leg excels
all men's; and for a hand, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd a foot, and a body,
though they be not to be ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]lked on, yet they are
past compare: he is not the [SEQ_SPLITTER]flower of courtesy,
but, I'll warrant him, as gent[SEQ_SPLITTER]le as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench; serve God. What,[SEQ_SPLITTER] have you dined at home?

JULIET:
No, no: but all [SEQ_SPLITTER]this did I know before.
What says he of our marria[SEQ_SPLITTER]ge? what of that?

Nurse:
Lord, how my head aches![SEQ_SPLITTER] what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in [SEQ_SPLITTER]twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side,--O, my ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me abo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut,
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

[SEQ_SPLITTER]JULIET:
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y love?

Nurse:
Your love says, like an honest gen[SEQ_SPLITTER]tleman, and a
courteous, and a kind, and a handsom[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your moth[SEQ_SPLITTER]er?

JULIET:
Where is my mother! why, she is withi[SEQ_SPLITTER]n;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'[SEQ_SPLITTER]Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is[SEQ_SPLITTER] your mother?'

Nurse:
O God's lady dear!
Are you [SEQ_SPLITTER]so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the poulti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ges yourself.

JULIET:
Here's such a coil! come, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat says Romeo?

Nurse:
Have you got leave to go t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o shrift to-day?

JULIET:
I have.

Nurse:
Then hie[SEQ_SPLITTER] you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a [SEQ_SPLITTER]husband to make you a wife:
Now comes the wanton b[SEQ_SPLITTER]lood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in scarlet stra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must anothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r way,
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am[SEQ_SPLITTER] the drudge and toil in your delight,
But you shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinne[SEQ_SPLITTER]r: hie you to the cell.

JULIET:
Hie to high fortu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne! Honest nurse, farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
So sm[SEQ_SPLITTER]ile the heavens upon this holy act,
That after hou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs with sorrow chide us not!

ROMEO:
Amen, amen! b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the[SEQ_SPLITTER] exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in[SEQ_SPLITTER] her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy [SEQ_SPLITTER]words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]It is enough I may but call her mine.

FRIAR LAURE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NCE:
These violent delights have violent ends
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which [SEQ_SPLITTER]as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Is loaths[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste conf[SEQ_SPLITTER]ounds the appetite:
Therefore love moderately; lon[SEQ_SPLITTER]g love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too [SEQ_SPLITTER]slow.
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
Will[SEQ_SPLITTER] ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may[SEQ_SPLITTER] bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton su[SEQ_SPLITTER]mmer air,
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

J[SEQ_SPLITTER]ULIET:
Good even to my ghostly confessor.

FRIAR L[SEQ_SPLITTER]AURENCE:
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us [SEQ_SPLITTER]both.

JULIET:
As much to him, else is his thanks [SEQ_SPLITTER]too much.

ROMEO:
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y joy
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This[SEQ_SPLITTER] neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold[SEQ_SPLITTER] the imagined happiness that both
Receive in eithe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r by this dear encounter.

JULIET:
Conceit, more r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substanc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that can [SEQ_SPLITTER]count their worth;
But my true love is grown to su[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, come with me, and we will ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke short work;
For, by your leaves, you shall not [SEQ_SPLITTER]stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one[SEQ_SPLITTER].

BENVOLIO:
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's ret[SEQ_SPLITTER]ire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if [SEQ_SPLITTER]we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
For now, thes[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

MERCUTIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
en[SEQ_SPLITTER]ters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
u[SEQ_SPLITTER]pon the table and says 'God send me no need of
the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

BE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NVOLIO:
Am I like such a fellow?

MERCUTIO:
Come, [SEQ_SPLITTER]come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any in[SEQ_SPLITTER] Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
soon[SEQ_SPLITTER] moody to be moved.

BENVOLIO:
And what to?

MERCU[SEQ_SPLITTER]TIO:
Nay, an there were two such, we should have n[SEQ_SPLITTER]one
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair [SEQ_SPLITTER]more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast[SEQ_SPLITTER]: thou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, [SEQ_SPLITTER]having no
other reason but because thou hast hazel[SEQ_SPLITTER] eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy out such[SEQ_SPLITTER] a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an e[SEQ_SPLITTER]gg is full of
meat, and yet thy head hath been bea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast [SEQ_SPLITTER]quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street, [SEQ_SPLITTER]because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asl[SEQ_SPLITTER]eep in the sun:
didst thou not fall out with a tai[SEQ_SPLITTER]lor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h another, for
tying his new shoes with old riband[SEQ_SPLITTER]? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

BE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NVOLIO:
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ny man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an[SEQ_SPLITTER] hour and a quarter.

MERCUTIO:
The fee-simple! O [SEQ_SPLITTER]simple!

BENVOLIO:
By my head, here come the Capul[SEQ_SPLITTER]ets.

MERCUTIO:
By my heel, I care not.

TYBALT:
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]ollow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentleme[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, good den: a word with one of you.

MERCUTIO:
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d but one word with one of us? couple it with
some[SEQ_SPLITTER]thing; make it a word and a blow.

TYBALT:
You sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
will gi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve me occasion.

MERCUTIO:
Could you not take some[SEQ_SPLITTER] occasion without giving?

TYBALT:
Mercutio, thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]consort'st with Romeo,--

MERCUTIO:
Consort! what,[SEQ_SPLITTER] dost thou make us minstrels? an
thou make minstre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ls of us, look to hear nothing but
discords: here'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s my fiddlestick; here's that shall
make you dance[SEQ_SPLITTER]. 'Zounds, consort!

BENVOLIO:
We talk here in the[SEQ_SPLITTER] public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ivate place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

MERCUT[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaz[SEQ_SPLITTER]e;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

TYB[SEQ_SPLITTER]ALT:
Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an.

MERCUTIO:
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear[SEQ_SPLITTER] your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be [SEQ_SPLITTER]your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call[SEQ_SPLITTER] him 'man.'

TYBALT:
Romeo, the hate I bear thee c[SEQ_SPLITTER]an afford
No better term than this,--thou art a vi[SEQ_SPLITTER]llain.

ROMEO:
Tybalt, the reason that I have to l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To[SEQ_SPLITTER] such a greeting: villain am I none;
Therefore far[SEQ_SPLITTER]ewell; I see thou know'st me not.

TYBALT:
Boy, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast do[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne me; therefore turn and draw.

ROMEO:
I do prote[SEQ_SPLITTER]st, I never injured thee,
But love thee better tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt know the reas[SEQ_SPLITTER]on of my love:
And so, good Capulet,--which name I[SEQ_SPLITTER] tender
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

MERCU[SEQ_SPLITTER]TIO:
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla [SEQ_SPLITTER]stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher,[SEQ_SPLITTER] will you walk?

TYBALT:
What wouldst thou have wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th me?

MERCUTIO:
Good king of cats, nothing but o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne of your nine
lives; that I mean to make bold wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]thal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, drybeat t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of his pitcher
by the ears? make haste, lest min[SEQ_SPLITTER]e be about your
ears ere it be out.

TYBALT:
I am [SEQ_SPLITTER]for you.

ROMEO:
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier u[SEQ_SPLITTER]p.

MERCUTIO:
Come, sir, your passado.

ROMEO:
Dra[SEQ_SPLITTER]w, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, [SEQ_SPLITTER]the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Ve[SEQ_SPLITTER]rona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

MERCUT[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am [SEQ_SPLITTER]sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?

BENVOLIO:
Wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO:
Ay, ay, a scratch, a [SEQ_SPLITTER]scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go,[SEQ_SPLITTER] villain, fetch a surgeon.

ROMEO:
Courage, man; t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he hurt cannot be much.

MERCUTIO:
No, 'tis not so[SEQ_SPLITTER] deep as a well, nor so wide as a
church-door; but[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
me to-morrow, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] warrant, for this world. A plague o'
both your ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]uses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
cat, to sc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ratch a man to death! a braggart, a
rogue, a villa[SEQ_SPLITTER]in, that fights by the book of
arithmetic! Why the[SEQ_SPLITTER] devil came you between us? I
was hurt under your [SEQ_SPLITTER]arm.

ROMEO:
I thought all for the best.

MERCUTIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]int. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made [SEQ_SPLITTER]worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too: you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r houses!

ROMEO:
This gentleman, the prince's nea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]n my behalf; my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's s[SEQ_SPLITTER]lander,--Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman[SEQ_SPLITTER]! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effemina[SEQ_SPLITTER]te
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

BENV[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLIO:
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too [SEQ_SPLITTER]untimely here did scorn the earth.

ROMEO:
This da[SEQ_SPLITTER]y's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but [SEQ_SPLITTER]begins the woe, others must end.

BENVOLIO:
Here c[SEQ_SPLITTER]omes the furious Tybalt back again.

ROMEO:
Alive,[SEQ_SPLITTER] in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, r[SEQ_SPLITTER]espective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct[SEQ_SPLITTER] now!
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but[SEQ_SPLITTER] a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o keep him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]st go with him.

TYBALT:
Thou, wretched boy, that [SEQ_SPLITTER]didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.

ROM[SEQ_SPLITTER]EO:
This shall determine that.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]way, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slai[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]th,
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

ROME[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
O, I am fortune's fool!

BENVOLIO:
Why dost tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u stay?

First Citizen:
Which way ran he that kill[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran [SEQ_SPLITTER]he?

BENVOLIO:
There lies that Tybalt.

First Citi[SEQ_SPLITTER]zen:
Up, sir, go with me;
I charge thee in the pri[SEQ_SPLITTER]nces name, obey.

PRINCE:
Where are the vile begin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ners of this fray?

BENVOLIO:
O noble prince, I ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]n discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal br[SEQ_SPLITTER]awl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
O prince[SEQ_SPLITTER]! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
O my de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of[SEQ_SPLITTER] ours, shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!

[SEQ_SPLITTER]PRINCE:
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]VOLIO:
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did s[SEQ_SPLITTER]lay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your hig[SEQ_SPLITTER]h displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath[SEQ_SPLITTER], calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not take tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]uce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace[SEQ_SPLITTER], but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Me[SEQ_SPLITTER]rcutio's breast,
Who all as hot, turns deadly poin[SEQ_SPLITTER]t to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd beats
Cold death aside, and with the other send[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: [SEQ_SPLITTER]Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, par[SEQ_SPLITTER]t!' and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm be[SEQ_SPLITTER]ats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushe[SEQ_SPLITTER]s; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tyb[SEQ_SPLITTER]alt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybal[SEQ_SPLITTER]t fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had[SEQ_SPLITTER] but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go [SEQ_SPLITTER]like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them[SEQ_SPLITTER], was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Rom[SEQ_SPLITTER]eo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvoli[SEQ_SPLITTER]o die.

LADY CAPULET:
He is a kinsman to the Monta[SEQ_SPLITTER]gue;
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Rom[SEQ_SPLITTER]eo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

PRINCE:
Rome[SEQ_SPLITTER]o slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Who now the price of[SEQ_SPLITTER] his dear blood doth owe?

MONTAGUE:
Not Romeo, pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ince, he was Mercutio's friend;
His fault conclude[SEQ_SPLITTER]s but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PRINCE:
And for that offence
Immediately we do e[SEQ_SPLITTER]xile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's [SEQ_SPLITTER]proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie[SEQ_SPLITTER] a-bleeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a [SEQ_SPLITTER]fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears n[SEQ_SPLITTER]or prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Therefore us[SEQ_SPLITTER]e none: let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he's [SEQ_SPLITTER]found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body[SEQ_SPLITTER] and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning[SEQ_SPLITTER] those that kill.

JULIET:
Gallop apace, you fiery[SEQ_SPLITTER]-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a w[SEQ_SPLITTER]agoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy clo[SEQ_SPLITTER]se curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's [SEQ_SPLITTER]eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amoro[SEQ_SPLITTER]us rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be bli[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn [SEQ_SPLITTER]me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair [SEQ_SPLITTER]of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, [SEQ_SPLITTER]bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till s[SEQ_SPLITTER]trange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted sim[SEQ_SPLITTER]ple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of [SEQ_SPLITTER]night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come[SEQ_SPLITTER], gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him[SEQ_SPLITTER] and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make[SEQ_SPLITTER] the face of heaven so fine
That all the world wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be in love with night
And pay no worship to the [SEQ_SPLITTER]garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love[SEQ_SPLITTER],
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not[SEQ_SPLITTER] yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the nig[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht before some festival
To an impatient child that[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here com[SEQ_SPLITTER]es my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue[SEQ_SPLITTER] that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloq[SEQ_SPLITTER]uence.
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there[SEQ_SPLITTER]? the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch?

Nurse:
Ay,[SEQ_SPLITTER] ay, the cords.

JULIET:
Ay me! what news? why dos[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thou wring thy hands?

Nurse:
Ah, well-a-day! he[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s dead, he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone, lady[SEQ_SPLITTER], we are undone!
Alack the day! he's gone, he's ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll'd, he's dead!

JULIET:
Can heaven be so envious[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

Nurse:
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo[SEQ_SPLITTER], Romeo!
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

J[SEQ_SPLITTER]ULIET:
What devil art thou, that dost torment me t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
And t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the deat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I, if there [SEQ_SPLITTER]be such an I;
Or those eyes shut, that make thee a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nswer 'I.'
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

Nurse:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
God s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave the mark!--here on his manly breast:
A piteous[SEQ_SPLITTER] corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashe[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, all bedaub'd in blood,
All in gore-blood; I swo[SEQ_SPLITTER]unded at the sight.

JULIET:
O, break, my heart! p[SEQ_SPLITTER]oor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'e[SEQ_SPLITTER]r look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; en[SEQ_SPLITTER]d motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy [SEQ_SPLITTER]bier!

Nurse:
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I [SEQ_SPLITTER]had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ev[SEQ_SPLITTER]er I should live to see thee dead!

JULIET:
What s[SEQ_SPLITTER]torm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slau[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound[SEQ_SPLITTER] the general doom!
For who is living, if those two[SEQ_SPLITTER] are gone?

Nurse:
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banis[SEQ_SPLITTER]hed;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

JULIE[SEQ_SPLITTER]T:
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

N[SEQ_SPLITTER]urse:
It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

JULIE[SEQ_SPLITTER]T:
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did[SEQ_SPLITTER] ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant[SEQ_SPLITTER]! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-r[SEQ_SPLITTER]avening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show![SEQ_SPLITTER]
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
A damn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]dst thou to do in hell,
When thou didst bower the [SEQ_SPLITTER]spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet [SEQ_SPLITTER]flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]o fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
In such[SEQ_SPLITTER] a gorgeous palace!

Nurse:
There's no trust,
No f[SEQ_SPLITTER]aith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forswor[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man[SEQ_SPLITTER]? give me some aqua vitae:
These griefs, these woe[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo![SEQ_SPLITTER]

JULIET:
Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish![SEQ_SPLITTER] he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is [SEQ_SPLITTER]ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may[SEQ_SPLITTER] be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O[SEQ_SPLITTER], what a beast was I to chide at him!

Nurse:
Will[SEQ_SPLITTER] you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

J[SEQ_SPLITTER]ULIET:
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ame,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cous[SEQ_SPLITTER]in?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husba[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native sprin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g;
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, [SEQ_SPLITTER]mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that[SEQ_SPLITTER] Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that [SEQ_SPLITTER]would have slain my husband:
All this is comfort; [SEQ_SPLITTER]wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser[SEQ_SPLITTER] than Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rget it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory,
Lik[SEQ_SPLITTER]e damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s dead, and Romeo--banished;'
That 'banished,' tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tyb[SEQ_SPLITTER]alts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had end[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]llow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy fat[SEQ_SPLITTER]her, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lam[SEQ_SPLITTER]entations might have moved?
But with a rear-ward f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ollowing Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished,' to s[SEQ_SPLITTER]peak that word,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, [SEQ_SPLITTER]Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
[SEQ_SPLITTER]There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that[SEQ_SPLITTER] word's death; no words can that woe sound.
Where [SEQ_SPLITTER]is my father, and my mother, nurse?

Nurse:
Weepin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you go to [SEQ_SPLITTER]them? I will bring you thither.

JULIET:
Wash they[SEQ_SPLITTER] his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
When [SEQ_SPLITTER]theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Take up th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ose cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you [SEQ_SPLITTER]and I; for Romeo is exiled:
He made you for a high[SEQ_SPLITTER]way to my bed;
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

Nurse:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
To comfort yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u: I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be here at night:
I'll to him; he is hid at Laur[SEQ_SPLITTER]ence' cell.

JULIET:
O, find him! give this ring t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o my true knight,
And bid him come to take his las[SEQ_SPLITTER]t farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo, come forth; co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me forth, thou fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d of thy parts,
And thou art wedded to calamity.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]ROMEO:
Father, what news? what is the prince's doo[SEQ_SPLITTER]m?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t I yet know not?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Too familiar
Is[SEQ_SPLITTER] my dear son with such sour company:
I bring thee [SEQ_SPLITTER]tidings of the prince's doom.

ROMEO:
What less th[SEQ_SPLITTER]an dooms-day is the prince's doom?

FRIAR LAURENCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
Not b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ody's death, but body's banishment.

ROMEO:
Ha, ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]nishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath[SEQ_SPLITTER] more terror in his look,
Much more than death: do[SEQ_SPLITTER] not say 'banishment.'

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hence from[SEQ_SPLITTER] Verona art thou banished:
Be patient, for the wor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld is broad and wide.

ROMEO:
There is no world wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]thout Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell i[SEQ_SPLITTER]tself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And world's exile is death: then banished,
Is deat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Thou cutt'[SEQ_SPLITTER]st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon[SEQ_SPLITTER] the stroke that murders me.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O de[SEQ_SPLITTER]adly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law[SEQ_SPLITTER] calls death; but the kind prince,
Taking thy part[SEQ_SPLITTER], hath rush'd aside the law,
And turn'd that black[SEQ_SPLITTER] word death to banishment:
This is dear mercy, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou seest it not.

ROMEO:
'Tis torture, and not [SEQ_SPLITTER]mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and eve[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]Romeo may not: more validity,
More honourable stat[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than Rome[SEQ_SPLITTER]o: they my seize
On the white wonder of dear Julie[SEQ_SPLITTER]t's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush[SEQ_SPLITTER], as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may [SEQ_SPLITTER]not; he is banished:
Flies may do this, but I from[SEQ_SPLITTER] this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banish[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed.
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]adst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
O friar, the [SEQ_SPLITTER]damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: [SEQ_SPLITTER]how hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly[SEQ_SPLITTER] confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d,
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

FRIAR [SEQ_SPLITTER]LAURENCE:
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord.

ROMEO:
O, thou wilt speak again of banishmen[SEQ_SPLITTER]t.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I'll give thee armour to keep [SEQ_SPLITTER]off that word:
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

ROMEO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philo[SEQ_SPLITTER]sophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse [SEQ_SPLITTER]a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not: ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]lk no more.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, then I see that ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]dmen have no ears.

ROMEO:
How should they, when t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat wise men have no eyes?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Let me[SEQ_SPLITTER] dispute with thee of thy estate.

ROMEO:
Thou can[SEQ_SPLITTER]st not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Wert thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but marri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and like me ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]nished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground, as I do [SEQ_SPLITTER]now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

FRIAR[SEQ_SPLITTER] LAURENCE:
Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thy[SEQ_SPLITTER]self.

ROMEO:
Not I; unless the breath of heartsic[SEQ_SPLITTER]k groans,
Mist-like, infold me from the search of [SEQ_SPLITTER]eyes.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hark, how they knock! Who's[SEQ_SPLITTER] there? Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ile! Stand up;
Run to my study. By and by! God's w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill,
What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
Who [SEQ_SPLITTER]knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Nurse:

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Welcome, then.

Nurse:
O[SEQ_SPLITTER] holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Where is my l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ady's lord, where's Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
There [SEQ_SPLITTER]on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

Nur[SEQ_SPLITTER]se:
O, he is even in my mistress' case,
Just in he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r case! O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament! Eve[SEQ_SPLITTER]n so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and[SEQ_SPLITTER] blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be[SEQ_SPLITTER] a man:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and [SEQ_SPLITTER]stand;
Why should you fall into so deep an O?

ROM[SEQ_SPLITTER]EO:
Nurse!

Nurse:
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he end of all.

ROMEO:
Spakest thou of Juliet? how[SEQ_SPLITTER] is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murd[SEQ_SPLITTER]erer,
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
[SEQ_SPLITTER]With blood removed but little from her own?
Where [SEQ_SPLITTER]is she? and how doth she? and what says
My conceal[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d lady to our cancell'd love?

Nurse:
O, she says[SEQ_SPLITTER] nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls [SEQ_SPLITTER]on her bed; and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again[SEQ_SPLITTER].

ROMEO:
As if that name,
Shot from the deadly le[SEQ_SPLITTER]vel of a gun,
Did murder her; as that name's curse[SEQ_SPLITTER]d hand
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ame lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hateful ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]nsion.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold thy desperate hand:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
Thy te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ars are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreaso[SEQ_SPLITTER]nable fury of a beast:
Unseemly woman in a seeming[SEQ_SPLITTER] man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] hast amazed me: by my holy order,
I thought thy d[SEQ_SPLITTER]isposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slain Tybalt[SEQ_SPLITTER]? wilt thou slay thyself?
And stay thy lady too th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at lives in thee,
By doing damned hate upon thysel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all thr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove, thy wit;
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hould bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy nob[SEQ_SPLITTER]le shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the[SEQ_SPLITTER] valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow p[SEQ_SPLITTER]erjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to[SEQ_SPLITTER] cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powd[SEQ_SPLITTER]er in a skitless soldier's flask,
Is set afire by [SEQ_SPLITTER]thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember'd with thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne own defence.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet [SEQ_SPLITTER]is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately[SEQ_SPLITTER] dead;
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy t[SEQ_SPLITTER]oo:
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy frie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
A [SEQ_SPLITTER]pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
Happine[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss courts thee in her best array;
But, like a misb[SEQ_SPLITTER]ehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy for[SEQ_SPLITTER]tune and thy love:
Take heed, take heed, for such [SEQ_SPLITTER]die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was de[SEQ_SPLITTER]creed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For [SEQ_SPLITTER]then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]lt live, till we can find a time
To blaze your mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]riage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thou[SEQ_SPLITTER]sand times more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lam[SEQ_SPLITTER]entation.
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady[SEQ_SPLITTER];
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Romeo is coming.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Nurse:
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
My[SEQ_SPLITTER] lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

ROMEO:
Do[SEQ_SPLITTER] so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

Nurse:
He[SEQ_SPLITTER]re, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you,[SEQ_SPLITTER] make haste, for it grows very late.

ROMEO:
How w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell my comfort is revived by this!

FRIAR LAURENCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tate:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y the break of day disguised from hence:
Sojourn i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n Mantua; I'll find out your man,
And he shall sig[SEQ_SPLITTER]nify from time to time
Every good hap to you that [SEQ_SPLITTER]chances here:
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l; good night.

ROMEO:
But that a joy past joy cal[SEQ_SPLITTER]ls out on me,
It were a grief, so brief to part wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th thee: Farewell.

CAPULET:
Things have fall'n ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, sir, so unluckily,
That we have had no time to [SEQ_SPLITTER]move our daughter:
Look you, she loved her kinsman[SEQ_SPLITTER] Tybalt dearly,
And so did I:--Well, we were born [SEQ_SPLITTER]to die.
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-ni[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght:
I promise you, but for your company,
I would [SEQ_SPLITTER]have been a-bed an hour ago.

PARIS:
These times o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f woe afford no time to woo.
Madam, good night: co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mmend me to your daughter.

LADY CAPULET:
I will, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she is[SEQ_SPLITTER] mew'd up to her heaviness.

CAPULET:
Sir Paris, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] will make a desperate tender
Of my child's love: [SEQ_SPLITTER]I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me; n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere [SEQ_SPLITTER]you go to bed;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' [SEQ_SPLITTER]love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-
But, soft! what day is this?

PARIS:
Monday, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord,

CAPULET:
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is[SEQ_SPLITTER] too soon,
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll kee[SEQ_SPLITTER]p no great ado,--a friend or two;
For, hark you, T[SEQ_SPLITTER]ybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we he[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel [SEQ_SPLITTER]much:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen frien[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

PARIS:
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-m[SEQ_SPLITTER]orrow.

CAPULET:
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be[SEQ_SPLITTER] it, then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Pre[SEQ_SPLITTER]pare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell[SEQ_SPLITTER], my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me! it i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s so very very late,
That we may call it early by [SEQ_SPLITTER]and by.
Good night.

JULIET:
Wilt thou be gone? it[SEQ_SPLITTER] is not yet near day:
It was the nightingale, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]not the lark,
That pierced the fearful hollow of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hine ear;
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tre[SEQ_SPLITTER]e:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

ROME[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nig[SEQ_SPLITTER]htingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace[SEQ_SPLITTER] the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candl[SEQ_SPLITTER]es are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on [SEQ_SPLITTER]the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, [SEQ_SPLITTER]or stay and die.

JULIET:
Yon light is not day-lig[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht, I know it, I:
It is some meteor that the sun e[SEQ_SPLITTER]xhales,
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd light thee on thy way to Mantua:
Therefore stay[SEQ_SPLITTER] yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

ROMEO:
Let me [SEQ_SPLITTER]be ta'en, let me be put to death;
I am content, so[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon grey is not th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e morning's eye,
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynth[SEQ_SPLITTER]ia's brow;
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I have more care to stay than will to go:
Come, de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
How is't, my[SEQ_SPLITTER] soul? let's talk; it is not day.

JULIET:
It is, [SEQ_SPLITTER]it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
It is the lark th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords [SEQ_SPLITTER]and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes swe[SEQ_SPLITTER]et division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Since [SEQ_SPLITTER]arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
O, now be gone[SEQ_SPLITTER]; more light and light it grows.

ROMEO:
More ligh[SEQ_SPLITTER]t and light; more dark and dark our woes!

Nurse:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Madam!

JULIET:
Nurse?

Nurse:
Your lady mother is[SEQ_SPLITTER] coming to your chamber:
The day is broke; be wary[SEQ_SPLITTER], look about.

JULIET:
Then, window, let day in, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd let life out.

ROMEO:
Farewell, farewell! one k[SEQ_SPLITTER]iss, and I'll descend.

JULIET:
Art thou gone so? [SEQ_SPLITTER]love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
I must hear from [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there [SEQ_SPLITTER]are many days:
O, by this count I shall be much in[SEQ_SPLITTER] years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!

ROMEO:
Farewe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my [SEQ_SPLITTER]greetings, love, to thee.

JULIET:
O think'st thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] we shall ever meet again?

ROMEO:
I doubt it not;[SEQ_SPLITTER] and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discours[SEQ_SPLITTER]es in our time to come.

JULIET:
O God, I have an [SEQ_SPLITTER]ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou a[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Eit[SEQ_SPLITTER]her my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

ROME[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry so[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

JULIET:
O fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
If thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]art fickle, what dost thou with him.
That is renow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I hop[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, thou wilt not keep him long,
But send him back.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

LADY CAPULET:

JULIET:
Who is't that calls? is i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hith[SEQ_SPLITTER]er?

LADY CAPULET:
Why, how now, Juliet!

JULIET:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Madam, I am not well.

LADY CAPULET:
Evermore weep[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou wash [SEQ_SPLITTER]him from his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst,[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou couldst not make him live;
Therefore, have d[SEQ_SPLITTER]one: some grief shows much of love;
But much of gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ief shows still some want of wit.

JULIET:
Yet let[SEQ_SPLITTER] me weep for such a feeling loss.

LADY CAPULET:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]o shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h you weep for.

JULIET:
Feeling so the loss,
Cann[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot choose but ever weep the friend.

LADY CAPULET:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his deat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h,
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him[SEQ_SPLITTER].

JULIET:
What villain madam?

LADY CAPULET:
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] same villain, Romeo.

JULIET:

LADY CAPULET:
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] is, because the traitor murderer lives.

JULIET:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
Would[SEQ_SPLITTER] none but I might venge my cousin's death!

LADY C[SEQ_SPLITTER]APULET:
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot:
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
That he shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, I hope, thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] wilt be satisfied.

JULIET:
Indeed, I never shall[SEQ_SPLITTER] be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if [SEQ_SPLITTER]you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
To wre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that sl[SEQ_SPLITTER]aughter'd him!

LADY CAPULET:
Find thou the means,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and I'll find such a man.
But now I'll tell thee [SEQ_SPLITTER]joyful tidings, girl.

JULIET:
And joy comes well [SEQ_SPLITTER]in such a needy time:
What are they, I beseech you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r ladyship?

LADY CAPULET:
Well, well, thou hast a[SEQ_SPLITTER] careful father, child;
One who, to put thee from [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy[SEQ_SPLITTER],
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.

J[SEQ_SPLITTER]ULIET:
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

LA[SEQ_SPLITTER]DY CAPULET:
Marry, my child, early next Thursday m[SEQ_SPLITTER]orn,
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
The C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ounty Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
Shall happil[SEQ_SPLITTER]y make thee there a joyful bride.

JULIET:
Now, by[SEQ_SPLITTER] Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
He shall not [SEQ_SPLITTER]make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this has[SEQ_SPLITTER]te; that I must wed
Ere he, that should be husband[SEQ_SPLITTER], comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, madam,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]swear,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Ra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther than Paris. These are news indeed!

LADY CAPU[SEQ_SPLITTER]LET:
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And see how he will take it at your hands.

CAPUL[SEQ_SPLITTER]ET:
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut for the sunset of my brother's son
It rains dow[SEQ_SPLITTER]nright.
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
For still th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow [SEQ_SPLITTER]with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this [SEQ_SPLITTER]salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Who, raging with[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy tears, and they with them,
Without a sudden c[SEQ_SPLITTER]alm, will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now[SEQ_SPLITTER], wife!
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

LAD[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y CAPULET:
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou thanks.
I would the fool were married to her gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave!

CAPULET:
Soft! take me with you, take me wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h you, wife.
How! will she none? doth she not give[SEQ_SPLITTER] us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she not count h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought[SEQ_SPLITTER]
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

JULI[SEQ_SPLITTER]ET:
Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve:
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thank[SEQ_SPLITTER]ful even for hate, that is meant love.

CAPULET:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
'Proud,[SEQ_SPLITTER]' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
And ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]t 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
Thank me no t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
But fettle your[SEQ_SPLITTER] fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
To go with Par[SEQ_SPLITTER]is to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on[SEQ_SPLITTER] a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion[SEQ_SPLITTER]! out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!

LADY CAPULET[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

JULIET:
Good fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patienc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e but to speak a word.

CAPULET:
Hang thee, young [SEQ_SPLITTER]baggage! disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what: get[SEQ_SPLITTER] thee to church o' Thursday,
Or never after look m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e in the face:
Speak not, reply not, do not answer[SEQ_SPLITTER] me;
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us b[SEQ_SPLITTER]lest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] now I see this one is one too much,
And that we h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!

N[SEQ_SPLITTER]urse:
God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y lord, to rate her so.

CAPULET:
And why, my lady[SEQ_SPLITTER] wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter [SEQ_SPLITTER]with your gossips, go.

Nurse:
I speak no treason.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

CAPULET:
O, God ye god-den.

Nurse:
May not one [SEQ_SPLITTER]speak?

CAPULET:
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
For here we need[SEQ_SPLITTER] it not.

LADY CAPULET:
You are too hot.

CAPULET:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
God's bread! it makes me mad:
Day, night, hour, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ide, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my[SEQ_SPLITTER] care hath been
To have her match'd: and having no[SEQ_SPLITTER]w provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair[SEQ_SPLITTER] demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as[SEQ_SPLITTER] one's thought would wish a man;
And then to have [SEQ_SPLITTER]a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ortune's tender,
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot[SEQ_SPLITTER] love,
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
But[SEQ_SPLITTER], as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze wher[SEQ_SPLITTER]e you will you shall not house with me:
Look to't,[SEQ_SPLITTER] think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is nea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll[SEQ_SPLITTER] give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang, beg,[SEQ_SPLITTER] starve, die in
the streets,
For, by my soul, I'll[SEQ_SPLITTER] ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall ne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ver do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t be forsworn.

JULIET:
Is there no pity sitting i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grie[SEQ_SPLITTER]f?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not,[SEQ_SPLITTER] make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Ty[SEQ_SPLITTER]balt lies.

LADY CAPULET:
Talk not to me, for I'll[SEQ_SPLITTER] not speak a word:
Do as thou wilt, for I have don[SEQ_SPLITTER]e with thee.

JULIET:
O God!--O nurse, how shall t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith[SEQ_SPLITTER] in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to e[SEQ_SPLITTER]arth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]y leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, al[SEQ_SPLITTER]ack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou? hast[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse.

Nur[SEQ_SPLITTER]se:
Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banish'd; and all [SEQ_SPLITTER]the world to nothing,
That he dares ne'er come bac[SEQ_SPLITTER]k to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it needs must be[SEQ_SPLITTER] by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now[SEQ_SPLITTER] it doth,
I think it best you married with the cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]nty.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so [SEQ_SPLITTER]quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my ve[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry heart,
I think you are happy in this second mat[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
As li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ving here and you no use of him.

JULIET:
Speakest[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou from thy heart?

Nurse:
And from my soul too[SEQ_SPLITTER];
Or else beshrew them both.

JULIET:
Amen!

Nurse[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
What?

JULIET:
Well, thou hast comforted me marv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ellous much.
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ving displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
To m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake confession and to be absolved.

Nurse:
Marry, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I will; and this is wisely done.

JULIET:
Ancient [SEQ_SPLITTER]damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to [SEQ_SPLITTER]wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with[SEQ_SPLITTER] above compare
So many thousand times? Go, counsel[SEQ_SPLITTER]lor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else[SEQ_SPLITTER] fail, myself have power to die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

PARIS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g slow to slack his haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
You sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y you do not know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ourse, I like it not.

PARIS:
Immoderately she wee[SEQ_SPLITTER]ps for Tybalt's death,
And therefore have I little[SEQ_SPLITTER] talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
[SEQ_SPLITTER]That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
And in[SEQ_SPLITTER] his wisdom hastes our marriage,
To stop the inund[SEQ_SPLITTER]ation of her tears;
Which, too much minded by hers[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf alone,
May be put from her by society:
Now do [SEQ_SPLITTER]you know the reason of this haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:

PARIS:
Happily met, my lady and my wife!

JULIE[SEQ_SPLITTER]T:
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

PARIS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

JUL[SEQ_SPLITTER]IET:
What must be shall be.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
That'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s a certain text.

PARIS:
Come you to make confess[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion to this father?

JULIET:
To answer that, I sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld confess to you.

PARIS:
Do not deny to him tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t you love me.

JULIET:
I will confess to you that[SEQ_SPLITTER] I love him.

PARIS:
So will ye, I am sure, that y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou love me.

JULIET:
If I do so, it will be of mor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r face.

PARIS:
Poor soul, thy face is much abused[SEQ_SPLITTER] with tears.

JULIET:
The tears have got small vic[SEQ_SPLITTER]tory by that;
For it was bad enough before their s[SEQ_SPLITTER]pite.

PARIS:
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith that report.

JULIET:
That is no slander, sir,[SEQ_SPLITTER] which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to[SEQ_SPLITTER] my face.

PARIS:
Thy face is mine, and thou hast [SEQ_SPLITTER]slander'd it.

JULIET:
It may be so, for it is not[SEQ_SPLITTER] mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
O[SEQ_SPLITTER]r shall I come to you at evening mass?

FRIAR LAUR[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENCE:
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

PARIS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]God shield I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hursday early will I rouse ye:
Till then, adieu; a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd keep this holy kiss.

JULIET:
O shut the door! [SEQ_SPLITTER]and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; pas[SEQ_SPLITTER]t hope, past cure, past help!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Ah,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ast the compass of my wits:
I hear thou must, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be marri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed to this county.

JULIET:
Tell me not, friar, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at thou hear'st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I[SEQ_SPLITTER] may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d with this knife I'll help it presently.
God join[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the la[SEQ_SPLITTER]bel to another deed,
Or my true heart with treache[SEQ_SPLITTER]rous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them [SEQ_SPLITTER]both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
'Twixt [SEQ_SPLITTER]my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]f what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

FRIAR L[SEQ_SPLITTER]AURENCE:
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Which craves as desperate an execution.
As that is[SEQ_SPLITTER] desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than[SEQ_SPLITTER] to marry County Paris,
Thou hast the strength of [SEQ_SPLITTER]will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt [SEQ_SPLITTER]undertake
A thing like death to chide away this sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ame,
That copest with death himself to scape from [SEQ_SPLITTER]it:
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

J[SEQ_SPLITTER]ULIET:
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
Fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in[SEQ_SPLITTER] thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are;[SEQ_SPLITTER] chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead me[SEQ_SPLITTER]n's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow c[SEQ_SPLITTER]hapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things[SEQ_SPLITTER] that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nstain'd wife to my sweet love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]old, then; go home, be merry, give consent
To marr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
To-morrow night l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ook that thou lie alone;
Let not thy nurse lie wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h thee in thy chamber:
Take thou this vial, being [SEQ_SPLITTER]then in bed,
And this distilled liquor drink thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]off;
When presently through all thy veins shall ru[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
Shall kee[SEQ_SPLITTER]p his native progress, but surcease:
No warmth, no[SEQ_SPLITTER] breath, shall testify thou livest;
The roses in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes, thy e[SEQ_SPLITTER]yes' windows fall,
Like death, when he shuts up th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e day of life;
Each part, deprived of supple gover[SEQ_SPLITTER]nment,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear lik[SEQ_SPLITTER]e death:
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eath
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the[SEQ_SPLITTER] bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m thy bed, there art thou dead:
Then, as the manne[SEQ_SPLITTER]r of our country is,
In thy best robes uncover'd o[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancien[SEQ_SPLITTER]t vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
Shall[SEQ_SPLITTER] Romeo by my letters know our drift,
And hither sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all he come: and he and I
Will watch thy waking, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to [SEQ_SPLITTER]Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present[SEQ_SPLITTER] shame;
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]bate thy valour in the acting it.

JULIET:
Give me[SEQ_SPLITTER], give me! O, tell not me of fear!

FRIAR LAURENCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In [SEQ_SPLITTER]this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
To Mant[SEQ_SPLITTER]ua, with my letters to thy lord.

JULIET:
Love giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Far[SEQ_SPLITTER]ewell, dear father!

CAPULET:
So many guests invit[SEQ_SPLITTER]e as here are writ.
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing cooks.

Second Servant:
You shall have none il[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, sir; for I'll try if they
can lick their finger[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.

CAPULET:
How canst thou try them so?

Second S[SEQ_SPLITTER]ervant:
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ick his
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick[SEQ_SPLITTER] his
fingers goes not with me.

CAPULET:
Go, be go[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne.
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

Nurse:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Ay, forsooth.

CAPULET:
Well, he may chance to do[SEQ_SPLITTER] some good on her:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry [SEQ_SPLITTER]it is.

Nurse:
See where she comes from shrift wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h merry look.

CAPULET:
How now, my headstrong! wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere have you been gadding?

JULIET:
Where I have l[SEQ_SPLITTER]earn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposit[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
By ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ardon: pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ev[SEQ_SPLITTER]er ruled by you.

CAPULET:
Send for the county; go[SEQ_SPLITTER] tell him of this:
I'll have this knot knit up to-[SEQ_SPLITTER]morrow morning.

JULIET:
I met the youthful lord a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I[SEQ_SPLITTER] might,
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.

CAPU[SEQ_SPLITTER]LET:
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Ay,[SEQ_SPLITTER] marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e God! this reverend holy friar,
Our whole city is[SEQ_SPLITTER] much bound to him.

JULIET:
Nurse, will you go wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful[SEQ_SPLITTER] ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morro[SEQ_SPLITTER]w?

LADY CAPULET:
No, not till Thursday; there is [SEQ_SPLITTER]time enough.

CAPULET:
Go, nurse, go with her: we'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll to church to-morrow.

LADY  CAPULET:
We shall b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.

CA[SEQ_SPLITTER]PULET:
Tush, I will stir about,
And all things sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Julie[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night; [SEQ_SPLITTER]let me alone;
I'll play the housewife for this onc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e. What, ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk[SEQ_SPLITTER] myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against[SEQ_SPLITTER] to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
Since this[SEQ_SPLITTER] same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

JULIET:
Ay, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hose attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
I pray t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee, leave me to myself to-night,
For I have need [SEQ_SPLITTER]of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon [SEQ_SPLITTER]my state,
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]full of sin.

LADY CAPULET:
What, are you busy, ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]? need you my help?

JULIET:
No, madam; we have cu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll'd such necessaries
As are behoveful for our sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]te to-morrow:
So please you, let me now be left al[SEQ_SPLITTER]one,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
In [SEQ_SPLITTER]this so sudden business.

LADY CAPULET:
Good night[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]JULIET:
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]in.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my ve[SEQ_SPLITTER]ins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll[SEQ_SPLITTER] call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! What s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hould she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must ac[SEQ_SPLITTER]t alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ork at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing?
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marria[SEQ_SPLITTER]ge he should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me[SEQ_SPLITTER] before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks,[SEQ_SPLITTER] it should not,
For he hath still been tried a hol[SEQ_SPLITTER]y man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere's a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be stifl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome[SEQ_SPLITTER] air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my R[SEQ_SPLITTER]omeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e horrible conceit of death and night,
Together wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an an[SEQ_SPLITTER]cient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]ars, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are pack[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed:
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]t some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack,[SEQ_SPLITTER] alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrak[SEQ_SPLITTER]es' torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, he[SEQ_SPLITTER]aring them, run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs?
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O, look! [SEQ_SPLITTER]methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo[SEQ_SPLITTER], that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point: st[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o thee.

LADY CAPULET:
Hold, take these keys, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]fetch more spices, nurse.

Nurse:
They call for da[SEQ_SPLITTER]tes and quinces in the pastry.

CAPULET:
Come, sti[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
The cu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Look to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he baked meats, good Angelica:
Spare not for the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ost.

Nurse:
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed[SEQ_SPLITTER]; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
For this night's[SEQ_SPLITTER] watching.

CAPULET:
No, not a whit: what! I have [SEQ_SPLITTER]watch'd ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne[SEQ_SPLITTER]'er been sick.

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, you have been a [SEQ_SPLITTER]mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from[SEQ_SPLITTER] such watching now.

CAPULET:
A jealous hood, a je[SEQ_SPLITTER]alous hood!
Now, fellow,
What's there?

First Serv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ant:
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what[SEQ_SPLITTER].

CAPULET:
Make haste, make haste.
Sirrah, fetch [SEQ_SPLITTER]drier logs:
Call Peter, he will show thee where th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey are.

Second Servant:
I have a head, sir, that [SEQ_SPLITTER]will find out logs,
And never trouble Peter for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e matter.

CAPULET:
Mass, and well said; a merry w[SEQ_SPLITTER]horeson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith[SEQ_SPLITTER], 'tis day:
The county will be here with music str[SEQ_SPLITTER]aight,
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]urse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
Go waken[SEQ_SPLITTER] Juliet, go and trim her up;
I'll go and chat with[SEQ_SPLITTER] Paris: hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroo[SEQ_SPLITTER]m he is come already:
Make haste, I say.

Nurse:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]istress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er, she:
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed[SEQ_SPLITTER]!
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride[SEQ_SPLITTER]!
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]The County Paris hath set up his rest,
That you sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all rest but little. God forgive me,
Marry, and am[SEQ_SPLITTER]en, how sound is she asleep!
I must needs wake her[SEQ_SPLITTER]. Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the county take you[SEQ_SPLITTER] in your bed;
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will [SEQ_SPLITTER]it not be?
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and[SEQ_SPLITTER] down again!
I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! la[SEQ_SPLITTER]dy!
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
O, wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l-a-day, that ever I was born!
Some aqua vitae, ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]! My lord! my lady!

LADY CAPULET:
What noise is h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere?

Nurse:
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET:
What[SEQ_SPLITTER] is the matter?

Nurse:
Look, look! O heavy day!

[SEQ_SPLITTER]LADY CAPULET:
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Help, he[SEQ_SPLITTER]lp! Call help.

CAPULET:
For shame, bring Juliet f[SEQ_SPLITTER]orth; her lord is come.

Nurse:
She's dead, deceas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed, she's dead; alack the day!

LADY CAPULET:
Alac[SEQ_SPLITTER]k the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

CA[SEQ_SPLITTER]PULET:
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Li[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe and these lips have long been separated:
Death [SEQ_SPLITTER]lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweete[SEQ_SPLITTER]st flower of all the field.

Nurse:
O lamentable d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay!

LADY CAPULET:
O woful time!

CAPULET:
Death, [SEQ_SPLITTER]that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up[SEQ_SPLITTER] my tongue, and will not let me speak.

FRIAR LAUR[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENCE:
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]APULET:
Ready to go, but never to return.
O son! t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he night before thy wedding-day
Hath Death lain wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th thy wife. There she lies,
Flower as she was, de[SEQ_SPLITTER]flowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, Death is [SEQ_SPLITTER]my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARIS:
Have I thought long to see this morning's fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

LAD[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y CAPULET:
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful da[SEQ_SPLITTER]y!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
In lasti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, on[SEQ_SPLITTER]e poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice [SEQ_SPLITTER]and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch'd it fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m my sight!

Nurse:
O woe! O woful, woful, woful d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay!
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
That ever[SEQ_SPLITTER], ever, I did yet behold!
O day! O day! O day! O h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
O woful day, O woful day!

PARIS:
Beguiled, divor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable death[SEQ_SPLITTER], by thee beguil'd,
By cruel cruel thee quite over[SEQ_SPLITTER]thrown!
O love! O life! not life, but love in deat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h!

CAPULET:
Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd[SEQ_SPLITTER], kill'd!
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child![SEQ_SPLITTER] my soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou! Alack! [SEQ_SPLITTER]my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ried.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Peace, ho, for shame! confu[SEQ_SPLITTER]sion's cure lives not
In these confusions. Heaven [SEQ_SPLITTER]and yourself
Had part in this fair maid; now heave[SEQ_SPLITTER]n hath all,
And all the better is it for the maid:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most[SEQ_SPLITTER] you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heav[SEQ_SPLITTER]en she should be advanced:
And weep ye now, seeing[SEQ_SPLITTER] she is advanced
Above the clouds, as high as heav[SEQ_SPLITTER]en itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so[SEQ_SPLITTER] ill,
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]he's not well married that lives married long;
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] she's best married that dies married young.
Dry u[SEQ_SPLITTER]p your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair[SEQ_SPLITTER] corse; and, as the custom is,
In all her best arr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay bear her to church:
For though fond nature bids[SEQ_SPLITTER] us an lament,
Yet nature's tears are reason's mer[SEQ_SPLITTER]riment.

CAPULET:
All things that we ordained fest[SEQ_SPLITTER]ival,
Turn from their office to black funeral;
Our[SEQ_SPLITTER] instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding chee[SEQ_SPLITTER]r to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn hymns to sulle[SEQ_SPLITTER]n dirges change,
Our bridal flowers serve for a bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ried corse,
And all things change them to the cont[SEQ_SPLITTER]rary.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sir, go you in; and, madam,[SEQ_SPLITTER] go with him;
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
The hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]vens do lour upon you for some ill;
Move them no m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore by crossing their high will.

First Musician:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.

Nurs[SEQ_SPLITTER]e:
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
For, we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll you know, this is a pitiful case.

First Musici[SEQ_SPLITTER]an:
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

PET[SEQ_SPLITTER]ER:
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s ease.'

First Musician:
Why 'Heart's ease?'

PET[SEQ_SPLITTER]ER:
O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'M[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dum[SEQ_SPLITTER]p,
to comfort me.

First Musician:
Not a dump we; [SEQ_SPLITTER]'tis no time to play now.

PETER:
You will not, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]en?

First Musician:
No.

PETER:
I will then give [SEQ_SPLITTER]it you soundly.

First Musician:
What will you giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e us?

PETER:
No money, on my faith, but the gleek[SEQ_SPLITTER];
I will give you the minstrel.

First Musician:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen I will give you the serving-creature.

PETER:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I'll fa you; do you note me?

First Musician:
An y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou re us and fa us, you note us.

Second Musician:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]t.

PETER:
Then have at you with my wit! I will dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y-beat you
with an iron wit, and put up my iron da[SEQ_SPLITTER]gger. Answer
me like men:
'When griping grief the [SEQ_SPLITTER]heart doth wound,
And doleful dumps the mind oppre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss,
Then music with her silver sound'--
why 'silve[SEQ_SPLITTER]r sound'? why 'music with her silver
sound'? What [SEQ_SPLITTER]say you, Simon Catling?

Musician:
Marry, sir, bec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ause silver hath a sweet sound.

PETER:
Pretty! Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at say you, Hugh Rebeck?

Second Musician:
I say '[SEQ_SPLITTER]silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PETER:
Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

Third Musician:
Faith, I know not what to say.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
PETER:
O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I [SEQ_SPLITTER]will say
for you. It is 'music with her silver sou[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd,'
because musicians have no gold for sounding:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]'Then music with her silver sound
With speedy help[SEQ_SPLITTER] doth lend redress.'

First Musician:
What a pesti[SEQ_SPLITTER]lent knave is this same!

Second Musician:
Hang hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
mourne[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs, and stay dinner.

ROMEO:
If I may trust the fl[SEQ_SPLITTER]attering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some jo[SEQ_SPLITTER]yful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in[SEQ_SPLITTER] his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spir[SEQ_SPLITTER]it
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thought[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Stran[SEQ_SPLITTER]ge dream, that gives a dead man leave
to think!--
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t I revived, and was an emperor.
Ah me! how sweet [SEQ_SPLITTER]is love itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows [SEQ_SPLITTER]are so rich in joy!
News from Verona!--How now, Ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]lthasar!
Dost thou not bring me letters from the f[SEQ_SPLITTER]riar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How far[SEQ_SPLITTER]es my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can be[SEQ_SPLITTER] ill, if she be well.

BALTHASAR:
Then she is well[SEQ_SPLITTER], and nothing can be ill:
Her body sleeps in Capel[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s monument,
And her immortal part with angels liv[SEQ_SPLITTER]es.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] presently took post to tell it you:
O, pardon me [SEQ_SPLITTER]for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t for my office, sir.

ROMEO:
Is it even so? then [SEQ_SPLITTER]I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging: get me[SEQ_SPLITTER] ink and paper,
And hire post-horses; I will hence[SEQ_SPLITTER] to-night.

BALTHASAR:
I do beseech you, sir, have[SEQ_SPLITTER] patience:
Your looks are pale and wild, and do im[SEQ_SPLITTER]port
Some misadventure.

ROMEO:
Tush, thou art dec[SEQ_SPLITTER]eived:
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ast thou no letters to me from the friar?

BALTHAS[SEQ_SPLITTER]AR:
No, my good lord.

ROMEO:
No matter: get thee [SEQ_SPLITTER]gone,
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee str[SEQ_SPLITTER]aight.
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do re[SEQ_SPLITTER]member an apothecary,--
And hereabouts he dwells,-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwh[SEQ_SPLITTER]elming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his [SEQ_SPLITTER]looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and [SEQ_SPLITTER]about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxe[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
R[SEQ_SPLITTER]emnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were[SEQ_SPLITTER] thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this [SEQ_SPLITTER]penury, to myself I said
'An if a man did need a p[SEQ_SPLITTER]oison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
O,[SEQ_SPLITTER] this same thought did but forerun my need;
And th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, [SEQ_SPLITTER]this should be the house.
Being holiday, the begga[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's shop is shut.
What, ho! apothecary!

Apothecar[SEQ_SPLITTER]y:
Who calls so loud?

ROMEO:
Come hither, man. I [SEQ_SPLITTER]see that thou art poor:
Hold, there is forty ducat[SEQ_SPLITTER]s: let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speedin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g gear
As will disperse itself through all the vei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violent[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal[SEQ_SPLITTER] cannon's womb.

Apothecary:
Such mortal drugs I h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave; but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that utte[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs them.

ROMEO:
Art thou so bare and full of wret[SEQ_SPLITTER]chedness,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy che[SEQ_SPLITTER]eks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ontempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
The world[SEQ_SPLITTER] is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The world [SEQ_SPLITTER]affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor[SEQ_SPLITTER], but break it, and take this.

Apothecary:
My pov[SEQ_SPLITTER]erty, but not my will, consents.

ROMEO:
I pay thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] poverty, and not thy will.

Apothecary:
Put this [SEQ_SPLITTER]in any liquid thing you will,
And drink it off; an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would[SEQ_SPLITTER] dispatch you straight.

ROMEO:
There is thy gold,[SEQ_SPLITTER] worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds [SEQ_SPLITTER]that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] hast sold me none.
Farewell: buy food, and get th[SEQ_SPLITTER]yself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith me
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

FRIAR JOHN:
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
This same should be the voice o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

FR[SEQ_SPLITTER]IAR JOHN:
Going to find a bare-foot brother out
On[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city[SEQ_SPLITTER] visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers[SEQ_SPLITTER] of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]use
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Sea[SEQ_SPLITTER]l'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
So t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

FRIAR LA[SEQ_SPLITTER]URENCE:
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

FRIAR[SEQ_SPLITTER] JOHN:
I could not send it,--here it is again,--
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]or get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful we[SEQ_SPLITTER]re they of infection.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Unhappy for[SEQ_SPLITTER]tune! by my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut full of charge
Of dear import, and the neglecti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
Ge[SEQ_SPLITTER]t me an iron crow, and bring it straight
Unto my c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell.

FRIAR JOHN:
Brother, I'll go and bring it th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Now must I to the monument al[SEQ_SPLITTER]one;
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She[SEQ_SPLITTER] will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notic[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of these accidents;
But I will write again to Ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
Poo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

PARI[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd yew-trees lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear[SEQ_SPLITTER] close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon[SEQ_SPLITTER] the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with d[SEQ_SPLITTER]igging up of graves,
But thou shalt hear it: whist[SEQ_SPLITTER]le then to me,
As signal that thou hear'st somethi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee, go.

PAGE:

PARIS:
Sweet flower, with flowers [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy bridal bed I strew,--
O woe! thy canopy is dus[SEQ_SPLITTER]t and stones;--
Which with sweet water nightly I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by[SEQ_SPLITTER] moans:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Ni[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghtly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]y gives warning something doth approach.
What curs[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed foot wanders this way to-night,
To cross my obs[SEQ_SPLITTER]equies and true love's rite?
What with a torch! mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ffle me, night, awhile.

ROMEO:
Give me that matto[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter;[SEQ_SPLITTER] early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] charge thee,
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stan[SEQ_SPLITTER]d all aloof,
And do not interrupt me in my course.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o behold my lady's face;
But chiefly to take thenc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t I must use
In dear employment: therefore hence, [SEQ_SPLITTER]be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
[SEQ_SPLITTER]In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hung[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my inte[SEQ_SPLITTER]nts are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorab[SEQ_SPLITTER]le far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

BALT[SEQ_SPLITTER]HASAR:
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]ROMEO:
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] that:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good[SEQ_SPLITTER] fellow.

BALTHASAR:

ROMEO:
Thou detestable maw, [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel[SEQ_SPLITTER] of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to o[SEQ_SPLITTER]pen,
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more foo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d!

PARIS:
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
It is supposed, the fair creature died;
And here [SEQ_SPLITTER]is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bod[SEQ_SPLITTER]ies: I will apprehend him.
Stop thy unhallow'd toi[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursued further[SEQ_SPLITTER] than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e:
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

ROMEO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good[SEQ_SPLITTER] gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly henc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Let them a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ffright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not anoth[SEQ_SPLITTER]er sin upon my head,
By urging me to fury: O, be g[SEQ_SPLITTER]one!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
Fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r I come hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be[SEQ_SPLITTER] gone; live, and hereafter say,
A madman's mercy b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ade thee run away.

PARIS:
I do defy thy conjurati[SEQ_SPLITTER]ons,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

ROMEO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

PAG[SEQ_SPLITTER]E:
O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]PARIS:
O, I am slain!
If thou be merciful,
Open th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e tomb, lay me with Juliet.

ROMEO:
In faith, I wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, n[SEQ_SPLITTER]oble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betos[SEQ_SPLITTER]sed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He[SEQ_SPLITTER] told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he[SEQ_SPLITTER] not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give [SEQ_SPLITTER]me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's[SEQ_SPLITTER] book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A gra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
For here l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there[SEQ_SPLITTER], by a dead man interr'd.
How oft when men are at [SEQ_SPLITTER]the point of death
Have they been merry! which the[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir keepers call
A lightning before death: O, how m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay I
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
De[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not c[SEQ_SPLITTER]onquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ps and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not[SEQ_SPLITTER] advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy b[SEQ_SPLITTER]loody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]sin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee her[SEQ_SPLITTER]e in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]still will stay with thee;
And never from this pal[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I r[SEQ_SPLITTER]emain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, he[SEQ_SPLITTER]re
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-weari[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your la[SEQ_SPLITTER]st embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, [SEQ_SPLITTER]seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsav[SEQ_SPLITTER]oury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run [SEQ_SPLITTER]on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s to my love!
O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are qu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ick. Thus with a kiss I die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sain[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Have my ol[SEQ_SPLITTER]d feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

BALTHASAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, go[SEQ_SPLITTER]od my friend,
What torch is yond, that vainly lend[SEQ_SPLITTER]s his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I disc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ern,
It burneth in the Capel's monument.

BALTHASA[SEQ_SPLITTER]R:
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
On[SEQ_SPLITTER]e that you love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who is it?

BALT[SEQ_SPLITTER]HASAR:
Romeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
How long hath he be[SEQ_SPLITTER]en there?

BALTHASAR:
Full half an hour.

FRIAR LA[SEQ_SPLITTER]URENCE:
Go with me to the vault.

BALTHASAR:
I dar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e not, sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence[SEQ_SPLITTER];
And fearfully did menace me with death,
If I did[SEQ_SPLITTER] stay to look on his intents.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
O, muc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h I fear some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR:
As I [SEQ_SPLITTER]did sleep under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ster and another fought,
And that my master slew h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo!
Alack, alack, what blo[SEQ_SPLITTER]od is this, which stains
The stony entrance of thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory s[SEQ_SPLITTER]words
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
R[SEQ_SPLITTER]omeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
And stee[SEQ_SPLITTER]p'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of[SEQ_SPLITTER] this lamentable chance!
The lady stirs.

JULIET:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do rememb[SEQ_SPLITTER]er well where I should be,
And there I am. Where i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s my Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I hear some noise. La[SEQ_SPLITTER]dy, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nnatural sleep:
A greater power than we can contra[SEQ_SPLITTER]dict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris[SEQ_SPLITTER] too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhoo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d of holy nuns:
Stay not to question, for the watc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h is coming;
Come, go, good Juliet,
I dare no long[SEQ_SPLITTER]er stay.

JULIET:
Go, get thee hence, for I will n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot away.
What's here? a cup, closed in my true lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless en[SEQ_SPLITTER]d:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some [SEQ_SPLITTER]poison yet doth hang on them,
To make die with a r[SEQ_SPLITTER]estorative.
Thy lips are warm.

First Watchman:

J[SEQ_SPLITTER]ULIET:
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dag[SEQ_SPLITTER]ger!
This is thy sheath;
there rust, and let me di[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

PAGE:
This is the place; there, where the torc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h doth burn.

First Watchman:
The ground is bloody[SEQ_SPLITTER]; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]oe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight! here lies th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e county slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and new[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly dead,
Who here hath lain these two days buried.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
Raise u[SEQ_SPLITTER]p the Montagues: some others search:
We see the gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ound whereon these woes do lie;
But the true groun[SEQ_SPLITTER]d of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circ[SEQ_SPLITTER]umstance descry.

Second Watchman:
Here's Romeo's [SEQ_SPLITTER]man; we found him in the churchyard.

First Watchm[SEQ_SPLITTER]an:
Hold him in safety, till the prince come hithe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r.

Third Watchman:
Here is a friar, that trembles[SEQ_SPLITTER], sighs and weeps:
We took this mattock and this s[SEQ_SPLITTER]pade from him,
As he was coming from this churchya[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd side.

First Watchman:
A great suspicion: stay [SEQ_SPLITTER]the friar too.

PRINCE:
What misadventure is so ea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rly up,
That calls our person from our morning's r[SEQ_SPLITTER]est?

CAPULET:
What should it be, that they so shr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iek abroad?

LADY CAPULET:
The people in the stree[SEQ_SPLITTER]t cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all [SEQ_SPLITTER]run,
With open outcry toward our monument.

PRINCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
What fear is this which startles in our ears?

F[SEQ_SPLITTER]irst Watchman:
Sovereign, here lies the County Par[SEQ_SPLITTER]is slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE:
Search, seek, and k[SEQ_SPLITTER]now how this foul murder comes.

First Watchman:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
With [SEQ_SPLITTER]instruments upon them, fit to open
These dead men'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s tombs.

CAPULET:
O heavens! O wife, look how our[SEQ_SPLITTER] daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en--for, [SEQ_SPLITTER]lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,--
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

LADY [SEQ_SPLITTER]CAPULET:
O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat warns my old age to a sepulchre.

PRINCE:
Come[SEQ_SPLITTER], Montague; for thou art early up,
To see thy son [SEQ_SPLITTER]and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE:
Alas, my lieg[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, my wife is dead to-night;
Grief of my son's exi[SEQ_SPLITTER]le hath stopp'd her breath:
What further woe consp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ires against mine age?

PRINCE:
Look, and thou sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]lt see.

MONTAGUE:
O thou untaught! what manners i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s in this?
To press before thy father to a grave?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
PRINCE:
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know the[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir spring, their head, their
true descent;
And the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n will I be general of your woes,
And lead you eve[SEQ_SPLITTER]n to death: meantime forbear,
And let mischance be[SEQ_SPLITTER] slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of sus[SEQ_SPLITTER]picion.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I am the greatest, able t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace
Doth make against me of this direful murder;
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself [SEQ_SPLITTER]condemned and myself excused.

PRINCE:
Then say at[SEQ_SPLITTER] once what thou dost know in this.

FRIAR LAURENCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is [SEQ_SPLITTER]not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, was husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead[SEQ_SPLITTER], that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and [SEQ_SPLITTER]their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, [SEQ_SPLITTER]whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegr[SEQ_SPLITTER]oom from the city,
For whom, and not for Tybalt, J[SEQ_SPLITTER]uliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om her,
Betroth'd and would have married her perfo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rce
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th wild looks, bid me devise some mean
To rid her [SEQ_SPLITTER]from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
[SEQ_SPLITTER]As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eath: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he should hit[SEQ_SPLITTER]her come as this dire night,
To help to take her f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s force should cease.
But he which bore my letter,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Friar John,
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternig[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the [SEQ_SPLITTER]prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om her kindred's vault;
Meaning to keep her closel[SEQ_SPLITTER]y at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]meo:
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of [SEQ_SPLITTER]her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and[SEQ_SPLITTER] true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome forth,
And bear this work of heaven with patie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce:
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But,[SEQ_SPLITTER] as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I [SEQ_SPLITTER]know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and,[SEQ_SPLITTER] if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Unto the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE:
We still[SEQ_SPLITTER] have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an? what can he say in this?

BALTHASAR:
I brought[SEQ_SPLITTER] my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in pos[SEQ_SPLITTER]t he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this [SEQ_SPLITTER]same monument.
This letter he early bid me give hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s father,
And threatened me with death, going in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he vault,
I departed not and left him there.

PRIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]CE:
Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the county's page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah[SEQ_SPLITTER], what made your master in this place?

PAGE:
He c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ame with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And bi[SEQ_SPLITTER]d me stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon comes one wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h light to ope the tomb;
And by and by my master d[SEQ_SPLITTER]rew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PRINCE:
This letter doth make good the friar's w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ords,
Their course of love, the tidings of her dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]th:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of[SEQ_SPLITTER] a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these e[SEQ_SPLITTER]nemies? Capulet! Montague!
See, what a scourge is [SEQ_SPLITTER]laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll your joys with love.
And I for winking at your [SEQ_SPLITTER]discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are[SEQ_SPLITTER] punish'd.

CAPULET:
O brother Montague, give me t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE:
But I can give thee mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] while Verona by that name is known,
There shall n[SEQ_SPLITTER]o figure at such rate be set
As that of true and f[SEQ_SPLITTER]aithful Juliet.

CAPULET:
As rich shall Romeo's by[SEQ_SPLITTER] his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]RINCE:
A glooming peace this morning with it bring[SEQ_SPLITTER]s;
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
Go[SEQ_SPLITTER] hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Som[SEQ_SPLITTER]e shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
For never [SEQ_SPLITTER]was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r Romeo.

WARWICK:
I wonder how the king escaped o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur hands.

YORK:
While we pursued the horsemen of [SEQ_SPLITTER]the north,
He slily stole away and left his men:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
Whose war[SEQ_SPLITTER]like ears could never brook retreat,
Cheer'd up th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e drooping army; and himself,
Lord Clifford and Lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd Stafford, all abreast,
Charged our main battle'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s front, and breaking in
Were by the swords of com[SEQ_SPLITTER]mon soldiers slain.

EDWARD:
Lord Stafford's fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, Duke of Buckingham,
Is either slain or wounded [SEQ_SPLITTER]dangerously;
I cleft his beaver with a downright b[SEQ_SPLITTER]low:
That this is true, father, behold his blood.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
MONTAGUE:
And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltsh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ire's blood,
Whom I encounter'd as the battles joi[SEQ_SPLITTER]n'd.

RICHARD:
Speak thou for me and tell them wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t I did.

YORK:
Richard hath best deserved of all [SEQ_SPLITTER]my sons.
But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somers[SEQ_SPLITTER]et?

NORFOLK:
Such hope have all the line of John [SEQ_SPLITTER]of Gaunt!

RICHARD:
Thus do I hope to shake King H[SEQ_SPLITTER]enry's head.

WARWICK:
And so do I. Victorious Pri[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce of York,
Before I see thee seated in that thro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
I vow [SEQ_SPLITTER]by heaven these eyes shall never close.
This is th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e palace of the fearful king,
And this the regal s[SEQ_SPLITTER]eat: possess it, York;
For this is thine and not K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing Henry's heirs'

YORK:
Assist me, then, sweet W[SEQ_SPLITTER]arwick, and I will;
For hither we have broken in b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y force.

NORFOLK:
We'll all assist you; he that f[SEQ_SPLITTER]lies shall die.

YORK:
Thanks, gentle Norfolk: sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]y by me, my lords;
And, soldiers, stay and lodge b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y me this night.

WARWICK:
And when the king comes[SEQ_SPLITTER], offer no violence,
Unless he seek to thrust you [SEQ_SPLITTER]out perforce.

YORK:
The queen this day here holds[SEQ_SPLITTER] her parliament,
But little thinks we shall be of [SEQ_SPLITTER]her council:
By words or blows here let us win our[SEQ_SPLITTER] right.

RICHARD:
Arm'd as we are, let's stay with[SEQ_SPLITTER]in this house.

WARWICK:
The bloody parliament sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll this be call'd,
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of Yor[SEQ_SPLITTER]k, be king,
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowar[SEQ_SPLITTER]dice
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.

YORK:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
I mean t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o take possession of my right.

WARWICK:
Neither t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he king, nor he that loves him best,
The proudest [SEQ_SPLITTER]he that holds up Lancaster,
Dares stir a wing, if [SEQ_SPLITTER]Warwick shake his bells.
I'll plant Plantagenet, r[SEQ_SPLITTER]oot him up who dares:
Resolve thee, Richard; claim[SEQ_SPLITTER] the English crown.

KING HENRY VI:
My lords, look[SEQ_SPLITTER] where the sturdy rebel sits,
Even in the chair of[SEQ_SPLITTER] state: belike he means,
Back'd by the power of Wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rwick, that false peer,
To aspire unto the crown a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd reign as king.
Earl of Northumberland, he slew [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy father.
And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both[SEQ_SPLITTER] have vow'd revenge
On him, his sons, his favourit[SEQ_SPLITTER]es and his friends.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I be not, [SEQ_SPLITTER]heavens be revenged on me!

CLIFFORD:
The hope the[SEQ_SPLITTER]reof makes Clifford mourn in steel.

WESTMORELAND:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.

KIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]G HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmorelan[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.

CLIFFORD:
Patience is for poltroons, such as h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e:
He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]My gracious lord, here in the parliament
Let us as[SEQ_SPLITTER]sail the family of York.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well has[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thou spoken, cousin: be it so.

KING HENRY VI:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]h, know you not the city favours them,
And they ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve troops of soldiers at their beck?

EXETER:
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.

KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] HENRY VI:
Far be the thought of this from Henry's[SEQ_SPLITTER] heart,
To make a shambles of the parliament-house[SEQ_SPLITTER]!
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
Shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be the war that Henry means to use.
Thou factiou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s Duke of York, descend my throne,
and kneel for g[SEQ_SPLITTER]race and mercy at my feet;
I am thy sovereign.

YO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RK:
I am thine.

EXETER:
For shame, come down: he [SEQ_SPLITTER]made thee Duke of York.

YORK:
'Twas my inheritanc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, as the earldom was.

EXETER:
Thy father was a t[SEQ_SPLITTER]raitor to the crown.

WARWICK:
Exeter, thou art a [SEQ_SPLITTER]traitor to the crown
In following this usurping He[SEQ_SPLITTER]nry.

CLIFFORD:
Whom should he follow but his natu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ral king?

WARWICK:
True, Clifford; and that's Ric[SEQ_SPLITTER]hard Duke of York.

KING HENRY VI:
And shall I sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, and thou sit in my throne?

YORK:
It must and [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall be so: content thyself.

WARWICK:
Be Duke of[SEQ_SPLITTER] Lancaster; let him be king.

WESTMORELAND:
He is [SEQ_SPLITTER]both king and Duke of Lancaster;
And that the Lord[SEQ_SPLITTER] of Westmoreland shall maintain.

WARWICK:
And War[SEQ_SPLITTER]wick shall disprove it. You forget
That we are tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]se which chased you from the field
And slew your f[SEQ_SPLITTER]athers, and with colours spread
March'd through th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e city to the palace gates.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yes, [SEQ_SPLITTER]Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
And, by his so[SEQ_SPLITTER]ul, thou and thy house shall rue it.

WESTMORELAND[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
Thy kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]sman and thy friends, I'll have more lives
Than dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ops of blood were in my father's veins.

CLIFFORD:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
I s[SEQ_SPLITTER]end thee, Warwick, such a messenger
As shall reven[SEQ_SPLITTER]ge his death before I stir.

WARWICK:
Poor Cliffor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d! how I scorn his worthless threats!

YORK:
Will [SEQ_SPLITTER]you we show our title to the crown?
If not, our sw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ords shall plead it in the field.

KING HENRY VI:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Thy f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy grandfat[SEQ_SPLITTER]her, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
I am the son o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f Henry the Fifth,
Who made the Dauphin and the Fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ench to stoop
And seized upon their towns and prov[SEQ_SPLITTER]inces.

WARWICK:
Talk not of France, sith thou has[SEQ_SPLITTER]t lost it all.

KING HENRY VI:
The lord protector [SEQ_SPLITTER]lost it, and not I:
When I was crown'd I was but n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ine months old.

RICHARD:
You are old enough now, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and yet, methinks, you lose.
Father, tear the crow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n from the usurper's head.

EDWARD:
Sweet father, [SEQ_SPLITTER]do so; set it on your head.

MONTAGUE:
Good brothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
Let's fight [SEQ_SPLITTER]it out and not stand cavilling thus.

RICHARD:
Sou[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.

YOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]K:
Sons, peace!

KING HENRY VI:
Peace, thou! and g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive King Henry leave to speak.

WARWICK:
Plantagen[SEQ_SPLITTER]et shall speak first: hear him, lords;
And be you [SEQ_SPLITTER]silent and attentive too,
For he that interrupts h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im shall not live.

KING HENRY VI:
Think'st thou t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat I will leave my kingly throne,
Wherein my gran[SEQ_SPLITTER]dsire and my father sat?
No: first shall war unpeo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ple this my realm;
Ay, and their colours, often bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rne in France,
And now in England to our heart's g[SEQ_SPLITTER]reat sorrow,
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint [SEQ_SPLITTER]you, lords?
My title's good, and better far than h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is.

WARWICK:
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be k[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing.

KING HENRY VI:
Henry the Fourth by conquest [SEQ_SPLITTER]got the crown.

YORK:
'Twas by rebellion against h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is king.

KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
What then?

KING H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENRY VI:
An if he may, then am I lawful king;
For [SEQ_SPLITTER]Richard, in the view of many lords,
Resign'd the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]rown to Henry the Fourth,
Whose heir my father was[SEQ_SPLITTER], and I am his.

YORK:
He rose against him, being [SEQ_SPLITTER]his sovereign,
And made him to resign his crown pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]rforce.

WARWICK:
Suppose, my lords, he did it unc[SEQ_SPLITTER]onstrain'd,
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]own?

EXETER:
No; for he could not so resign his c[SEQ_SPLITTER]rown
But that the next heir should succeed and rei[SEQ_SPLITTER]gn.

KING HENRY VI:
Art thou against us, Duke of E[SEQ_SPLITTER]xeter?

EXETER:
His is the right, and therefore pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rdon me.

YORK:
Why whisper you, my lords, and ans[SEQ_SPLITTER]wer not?

EXETER:
My conscience tells me he is law[SEQ_SPLITTER]ful king.

KING HENRY VI:

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Plantag[SEQ_SPLITTER]enet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
Think not tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Henry shall be so deposed.

WARWICK:
Deposed he [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall be, in despite of all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
Of Ess[SEQ_SPLITTER]ex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
Which makes the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e thus presumptuous and proud,
Can set the duke up[SEQ_SPLITTER] in despite of me.

CLIFFORD:
King Henry, be thy t[SEQ_SPLITTER]itle right or wrong,
Lord Clifford vows to fight i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n thy defence:
May that ground gape and swallow me[SEQ_SPLITTER] alive,
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther!

KING HENRY VI:
O Clifford, how thy words re[SEQ_SPLITTER]vive my heart!

YORK:
Henry of Lancaster, resign t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy crown.
What mutter you, or what conspire you, l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ords?

WARWICK:
Do right unto this princely Duke o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f York,
Or I will fill the house with armed men,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd over the chair of state, where now he sits,
Wri[SEQ_SPLITTER]te up his title with usurping blood.

KING HENRY V[SEQ_SPLITTER]I:
My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:
Let m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e for this my life-time reign as king.

YORK:
Conf[SEQ_SPLITTER]irm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
And thou sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]alt reign in quiet while thou livest.

KING HENRY [SEQ_SPLITTER]VI:
I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
Enjoy the k[SEQ_SPLITTER]ingdom after my decease.

CLIFFORD:
What wrong is [SEQ_SPLITTER]this unto the prince your son!

WARWICK:
What good[SEQ_SPLITTER] is this to England and himself!

WESTMORELAND:
Ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]se, fearful and despairing Henry!

CLIFFORD:
How h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ast thou injured both thyself and us!

WESTMORELAN[SEQ_SPLITTER]D:
I cannot stay to hear these articles.

NORTHUMB[SEQ_SPLITTER]ERLAND:
Nor I.

CLIFFORD:
Come, cousin, let us tel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l the queen these news.

WESTMORELAND:
Farewell, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]aint-hearted and degenerate king,
In whose cold bl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood no spark of honour bides.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou a prey unto the house of York,
And die in ban[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds for this unmanly deed!

CLIFFORD:
In dreadful w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar mayst thou be overcome,
Or live in peace abando[SEQ_SPLITTER]n'd and despised!

WARWICK:
Turn this way, Henry, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and regard them not.

EXETER:
They seek revenge an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d therefore will not yield.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, Ex[SEQ_SPLITTER]eter!

WARWICK:
Why should you sigh, my lord?

KIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]G HENRY VI:
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my s[SEQ_SPLITTER]on,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
But be it[SEQ_SPLITTER] as it may: I here entail
The crown to thee and to[SEQ_SPLITTER] thine heirs for ever;
Conditionally, that here th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou take an oath
To cease this civil war, and, whil[SEQ_SPLITTER]st I live,
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And neither by treason nor hostility
To seek to p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut me down and reign thyself.

YORK:
This oath I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]illingly take and will perform.

WARWICK:
Long liv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.

KING HENRY[SEQ_SPLITTER] VI:
And long live thou and these thy forward sons[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

YORK:
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.

E[SEQ_SPLITTER]XETER:
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

YORK:
Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]stle.

WARWICK:
And I'll keep London with my soldi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ers.

NORFOLK:
And I to Norfolk with my followers.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

MONTAGUE:
And I unto the sea from whence I came.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KING HENRY VI:
And I, with grief and sorrow, to [SEQ_SPLITTER]the court.

EXETER:
Here comes the queen, whose lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]oks bewray her anger:
I'll steal away.

KING HENRY[SEQ_SPLITTER] VI:
Exeter, so will I.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, go n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot from me; I will follow thee.

KING HENRY VI:
Be[SEQ_SPLITTER] patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.

QUEEN MA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RGARET:
Who can be patient in such extremes?
Ah, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]retched man! would I had died a maid
And never see[SEQ_SPLITTER]n thee, never borne thee son,
Seeing thou hast pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ved so unnatural a father
Hath he deserved to lose[SEQ_SPLITTER] his birthright thus?
Hadst thou but loved him hal[SEQ_SPLITTER]f so well as I,
Or felt that pain which I did for [SEQ_SPLITTER]him once,
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere,
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And disinherited thine only son.

PRINCE EDWARD:
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather, you cannot disinherit me:
If you be king, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy should not I succeed?

KING HENRY VI:
Pardon me[SEQ_SPLITTER], Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
The Earl of Warw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ick and the duke enforced me.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Enf[SEQ_SPLITTER]orced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
I s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
Thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
And given un[SEQ_SPLITTER]to the house of York such head
As thou shalt reign[SEQ_SPLITTER] but by their sufferance.
To entail him and his he[SEQ_SPLITTER]irs unto the crown,
What is it, but to make thy se[SEQ_SPLITTER]pulchre
And creep into it far before thy time?
War[SEQ_SPLITTER]wick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
Stern F[SEQ_SPLITTER]alconbridge commands the narrow seas;
The duke is [SEQ_SPLITTER]made protector of the realm;
And yet shalt thou be[SEQ_SPLITTER] safe? such safety finds
The trembling lamb enviro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ned with wolves.
Had I been there, which am a sill[SEQ_SPLITTER]y woman,
The soldiers should have toss'd me on the[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir pikes
Before I would have granted to that act.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
Both f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
Until that act [SEQ_SPLITTER]of parliament be repeal'd
Whereby my son is disinh[SEQ_SPLITTER]erited.
The northern lords that have forsworn thy [SEQ_SPLITTER]colours
Will follow mine, if once they see them sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]read;
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce
And utter ruin of the house of York.
Thus do I [SEQ_SPLITTER]leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
Our army is rea[SEQ_SPLITTER]dy; come, we'll after them.

KING HENRY VI:
Stay, [SEQ_SPLITTER]gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.

QUEEN MARGARE[SEQ_SPLITTER]T:
Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone[SEQ_SPLITTER].

KING HENRY VI:
Gentle son Edward, thou wilt sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]y with me?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, to be murder'd by [SEQ_SPLITTER]his enemies.

PRINCE EDWARD:
When I return with vi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ctory from the field
I'll see your grace: till the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n I'll follow her.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, son, awa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y; we may not linger thus.

KING HENRY VI:
Poor qu[SEQ_SPLITTER]een! how love to me and to her son
Hath made her b[SEQ_SPLITTER]reak out into terms of rage!
Revenged may she be o[SEQ_SPLITTER]n that hateful duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged [SEQ_SPLITTER]with desire,
Will cost my crown, and like an empty[SEQ_SPLITTER] eagle
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]loss of those three lords torments my heart:
I'll [SEQ_SPLITTER]write unto them and entreat them fair.
Come, cousi[SEQ_SPLITTER]n you shall be the messenger.

EXETER:
And I, I ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]pe, shall reconcile them all.
3 KING HENRY VI

RIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]HARD:
Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave[SEQ_SPLITTER].

EDWARD:
No, I can better play the orator.

MONT[SEQ_SPLITTER]AGUE:
But I have reasons strong and forcible.

YOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]K:
Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at is your quarrel? how began it first?

EDWARD:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]o quarrel, but a slight contention.

YORK:
About w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat?

RICHARD:
About that which concerns your grac[SEQ_SPLITTER]e and us;
The crown of England, father, which is y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ours.

YORK:
Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead[SEQ_SPLITTER].

RICHARD:
Your right depends not on his life or [SEQ_SPLITTER]death.

EDWARD:
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy [SEQ_SPLITTER]it now:
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to [SEQ_SPLITTER]breathe,
It will outrun you, father, in the end.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]YORK:
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

EDWARD:
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year[SEQ_SPLITTER].

RICHARD:
No; God forbid your grace should be fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rsworn.

YORK:
I shall be, if I claim by open war.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

RICHARD:
I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear[SEQ_SPLITTER] me speak.

YORK:
Thou canst not, son; it is impos[SEQ_SPLITTER]sible.

RICHARD:
An oath is of no moment, being no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t took
Before a true and lawful magistrate,
That h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath authority over him that swears:
Henry had none[SEQ_SPLITTER], but did usurp the place;
Then, seeing 'twas he t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat made you to depose,
Your oath, my lord, is vai[SEQ_SPLITTER]n and frivolous.
Therefore, to arms! And, father, [SEQ_SPLITTER]do but think
How sweet a thing it is to wear a cro[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn;
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And all that p[SEQ_SPLITTER]oets feign of bliss and joy.
Why do we finger thus[SEQ_SPLITTER]? I cannot rest
Until the white rose that I wear b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e dyed
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart[SEQ_SPLITTER].

YORK:
Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
And whet [SEQ_SPLITTER]on Warwick to this enterprise.
Thou, Richard, shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]t to the Duke of Norfolk,
And tell him privily of [SEQ_SPLITTER]our intent.
You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:
In [SEQ_SPLITTER]them I trust; for they are soldiers,
Witty, courte[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous, liberal, full of spirit.
While you are thus e[SEQ_SPLITTER]mploy'd, what resteth more,
But that I seek occasi[SEQ_SPLITTER]on how to rise,
And yet the king not privy to my d[SEQ_SPLITTER]rift,
Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
But, stay[SEQ_SPLITTER]: what news? Why comest thou in such post?

Messen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ger:
The queen with all the northern earls and lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds
Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
She [SEQ_SPLITTER]is hard by with twenty thousand men;
And therefore[SEQ_SPLITTER] fortify your hold, my lord.

YORK:
Ay, with my sw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
Edward[SEQ_SPLITTER] and Richard, you shall stay with me;
My brother M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ontague shall post to London:
Let noble Warwick, C[SEQ_SPLITTER]obham, and the rest,
Whom we have left protectors [SEQ_SPLITTER]of the king,
With powerful policy strengthen thems[SEQ_SPLITTER]elves,
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MONTAGUE:
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t:
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
Sir Jo[SEQ_SPLITTER]hn and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,
You are com[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to Sandal in a happy hour;
The army of the queen[SEQ_SPLITTER] mean to besiege us.

JOHN MORTIMER:
She shall not[SEQ_SPLITTER] need; we'll meet her in the field.

YORK:
What, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith five thousand men?

RICHARD:
Ay, with five hun[SEQ_SPLITTER]dred, father, for a need:
A woman's general; what [SEQ_SPLITTER]should we fear?

EDWARD:
I hear their drums: let's[SEQ_SPLITTER] set our men in order,
And issue forth and bid the[SEQ_SPLITTER]m battle straight.

YORK:
Five men to twenty! thou[SEQ_SPLITTER]gh the odds be great,
I doubt not, uncle, of our v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ictory.
Many a battle have I won in France,
When a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the enemy hath been ten to one:
Why should I not[SEQ_SPLITTER] now have the like success?
3 KING HENRY VI

RUTLA[SEQ_SPLITTER]ND:
Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!

CLI[SEQ_SPLITTER]FFORD:
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy li[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe.
As for the brat of this accursed duke,
Whose f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather slew my father, he shall die.

Tutor:
And I,[SEQ_SPLITTER] my lord, will bear him company.

CLIFFORD:
Soldie[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs, away with him!

Tutor:
Ah, Clifford, murder no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t this innocent child,
Lest thou be hated both of [SEQ_SPLITTER]God and man!

CLIFFORD:
How now! is he dead alread[SEQ_SPLITTER]y? or is it fear
That makes him close his eyes? I'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll open them.

RUTLAND:
So looks the pent-up lion [SEQ_SPLITTER]o'er the wretch
That trembles under his devouring [SEQ_SPLITTER]paws;
And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
Ah, gent[SEQ_SPLITTER]le Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
And not with [SEQ_SPLITTER]such a cruel threatening look.
Sweet Clifford, hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r me speak before I die.
I am too mean a subject f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or thy wrath:
Be thou revenged on men, and let me [SEQ_SPLITTER]live.

CLIFFORD:
In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; [SEQ_SPLITTER]my father's blood
Hath stopp'd the passage where t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy words should enter.

RUTLAND:
Then let my fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's blood open it again:
He is a man, and, Cliffor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, cope with him.

CLIFFORD:
Had thy brethren here[SEQ_SPLITTER], their lives and thine
Were not revenge sufficien[SEQ_SPLITTER]t for me;
No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' grav[SEQ_SPLITTER]es
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
It [SEQ_SPLITTER]could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
The s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight of any of the house of York
Is as a fury to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]orment my soul;
And till I root out their accursed[SEQ_SPLITTER] line
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
The[SEQ_SPLITTER]refore--

RUTLAND:
O, let me pray before I take my[SEQ_SPLITTER] death!
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!

[SEQ_SPLITTER]CLIFFORD:
Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
RUTLAND:
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou sla[SEQ_SPLITTER]y me?

CLIFFORD:
Thy father hath.

RUTLAND:
But 't[SEQ_SPLITTER]was ere I was born.
Thou hast one son; for his sak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e pity me,
Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is ju[SEQ_SPLITTER]st,
He be as miserably slain as I.
Ah, let me live[SEQ_SPLITTER] in prison all my days;
And when I give occasion o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f offence,
Then let me die, for now thou hast no c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ause.

CLIFFORD:
No cause!
Thy father slew my fath[SEQ_SPLITTER]er; therefore, die.

RUTLAND:
Di faciant laudis su[SEQ_SPLITTER]mma sit ista tuae!

CLIFFORD:
Plantagenet! I come,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Plantagenet!
And this thy son's blood cleaving to[SEQ_SPLITTER] my blade
Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy bloo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d,
Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]3 KING HENRY VI

YORK:
The army of the queen hath [SEQ_SPLITTER]got the field:
My uncles both are slain in rescuin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g me;
And all my followers to the eager foe
Turn b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ack and fly, like ships before the wind
Or lambs p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ursued by hunger-starved wolves.
My sons, God know[SEQ_SPLITTER]s what hath bechanced them:
But this I know, they [SEQ_SPLITTER]have demean'd themselves
Like men born to renown b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y life or death.
Three times did Richard make a la[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne to me.
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight[SEQ_SPLITTER] it out!'
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
In blood[SEQ_SPLITTER] of those that had encounter'd him:
And when the h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ardiest warriors did retire,
Richard cried 'Charge[SEQ_SPLITTER]! and give no foot of ground!'
And cried 'A crown,[SEQ_SPLITTER] or else a glorious tomb!
A sceptre, or an earthly[SEQ_SPLITTER] sepulchre!'
With this, we charged again: but, out[SEQ_SPLITTER], alas!
We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
Wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h bootless labour swim against the tide
And spend [SEQ_SPLITTER]her strength with over-matching waves.
Ah, hark! t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he fatal followers do pursue;
And I am faint and c[SEQ_SPLITTER]annot fly their fury:
And were I strong, I would n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot shun their fury:
The sands are number'd that ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke up my life;
Here must I stay, and here my life [SEQ_SPLITTER]must end.
Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberl[SEQ_SPLITTER]and,
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
I a[SEQ_SPLITTER]m your butt, and I abide your shot.

NORTHUMBERLAN[SEQ_SPLITTER]D:
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.

CLIFFOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]D:
Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
With dow[SEQ_SPLITTER]nright payment, show'd unto my father.
Now Phaetho[SEQ_SPLITTER]n hath tumbled from his car,
And made an evening a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the noontide prick.

YORK:
My ashes, as the phoe[SEQ_SPLITTER]nix, may bring forth
A bird that will revenge upon[SEQ_SPLITTER] you all:
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to he[SEQ_SPLITTER]aven,
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?

CLIF[SEQ_SPLITTER]FORD:
So cowards fight when they can fly no furthe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r;
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.

YOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]K:
O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
And in[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy thought o'er-run my former time;
And, if thou[SEQ_SPLITTER]gh canst for blushing, view this face,
And bite th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
Whose f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!

CLIFF[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORD:
I will not bandy with thee word for word,
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.

QUEEN[SEQ_SPLITTER] MARGARET:
Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand [SEQ_SPLITTER]causes
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Hold, Clifford! do not honour him[SEQ_SPLITTER] so much
To prick thy finger, though to wound his [SEQ_SPLITTER]heart:
What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,
When[SEQ_SPLITTER] he might spurn him with his foot away?
It is war'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s prize to take all vantages;
And ten to one is no[SEQ_SPLITTER] impeach of valour.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, ay, so strives [SEQ_SPLITTER]the woodcock with the gin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
So dot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h the cony struggle in the net.

YORK:
So triumph [SEQ_SPLITTER]thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
So true men yi[SEQ_SPLITTER]eld, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.

NORTHUMBERLAND:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
What would your grace have done unto him now?

QU[SEQ_SPLITTER]EEN MARGARET:
Brave warriors, Clifford and Northum[SEQ_SPLITTER]berland,
Come, make him stand upon this molehill h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere,
That raught at mountains with outstretched ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]ms,
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
What![SEQ_SPLITTER] was it you that would be England's king?
Was't yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u that revell'd in our parliament,
And made a prea[SEQ_SPLITTER]chment of your high descent?
Where are your mess o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f sons to back you now?
The wanton Edward, and the[SEQ_SPLITTER] lusty George?
And where's that valiant crook-back[SEQ_SPLITTER] prodigy,
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling [SEQ_SPLITTER]voice
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Or, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
Look,[SEQ_SPLITTER] York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
That v[SEQ_SPLITTER]aliant Clifford, with his rapier's point,
Made iss[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue from the bosom of the boy;
And if thine eyes ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]n water for his death,
I give thee this to dry thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] cheeks withal.
Alas poor York! but that I hate th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee deadly,
I should lament thy miserable state.
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
What, hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
That n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
Why art th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
And I, to m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake thee mad, do mock thee thus.
Stamp, rave, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]fret, that I may sing and dance.
Thou wouldst be f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee'd, I see, to make me sport:
York cannot speak, [SEQ_SPLITTER]unless he wear a crown.
A crown for York! and, lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds, bow low to him:
Hold you his hands, whilst I d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o set it on.
Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a k[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing!
Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And this is he was his adopted heir.
But how is it[SEQ_SPLITTER] that great Plantagenet
Is crown'd so soon, and br[SEQ_SPLITTER]oke his solemn oath?
As I bethink me, you should n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot be king
Till our King Henry had shook hands wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h death.
And will you pale your head in Henry's gl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ory,
And rob his temples of the diadem,
Now in his[SEQ_SPLITTER] life, against your holy oath?
O, 'tis a fault too[SEQ_SPLITTER] too unpardonable!
Off with the crown, and with th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e crown his head;
And, whilst we breathe, take tim[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to do him dead.

CLIFFORD:
That is my office, fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r my father's sake.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, stay; le[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts hear the orisons he makes.

YORK:
She-wolf of F[SEQ_SPLITTER]rance, but worse than wolves of France,
Whose tong[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
How ill-be[SEQ_SPLITTER]seeming is it in thy sex
To triumph, like an Amazo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nian trull,
Upon their woes whom fortune captivate[SEQ_SPLITTER]s!
But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
I would assa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, proud queen, to make thee blush.
To tell thee w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hence thou camest, of whom derived,
Were shame eno[SEQ_SPLITTER]ugh to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
Thy fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther bears the type of King of Naples,
Of both the[SEQ_SPLITTER] Sicils and Jerusalem,
Yet not so wealthy as an En[SEQ_SPLITTER]glish yeoman.
Hath that poor monarch taught thee t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o insult?
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ud queen,
Unless the adage must be verified,
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]beggars mounted run their horse to death.
'Tis bea[SEQ_SPLITTER]uty that doth oft make women proud;
But, God he kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ows, thy share thereof is small:
'Tis virtue that [SEQ_SPLITTER]doth make them most admired;
The contrary doth mak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e thee wonder'd at:
'Tis government that makes the[SEQ_SPLITTER]m seem divine;
The want thereof makes thee abomina[SEQ_SPLITTER]ble:
Thou art as opposite to every good
As the Ant[SEQ_SPLITTER]ipodes are unto us,
Or as the south to the septent[SEQ_SPLITTER]rion.
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
How[SEQ_SPLITTER] couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
And yet be [SEQ_SPLITTER]seen to bear a woman's face?
Women are soft, mild,[SEQ_SPLITTER] pitiful and flexible;
Thou stern, obdurate, flint[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, rough, remorseless.
Bids't thou me rage? why, n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow thou hast thy wish:
Wouldst have me weep? why, [SEQ_SPLITTER]now thou hast thy will:
For raging wind blows up i[SEQ_SPLITTER]ncessant showers,
And when the rage allays, the ra[SEQ_SPLITTER]in begins.
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obse[SEQ_SPLITTER]quies:
And every drop cries vengeance for his deat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h,
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
Fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]enchwoman.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Beshrew me, but his pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssion moves me so
That hardly can I cheque my eyes[SEQ_SPLITTER] from tears.

YORK:
That face of his the hungry ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]nnibals
Would not have touch'd, would not have sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]in'd with blood:
But you are more inhuman, more in[SEQ_SPLITTER]exorable,
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ia.
See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And I with tears do wash the blood away.
Keep tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u the napkin, and go boast of this:
And if thou te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll'st the heavy story right,
Upon my soul, the hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rers will shed tears;
Yea even my foes will shed f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ast-falling tears,
And say 'Alas, it was a piteous[SEQ_SPLITTER] deed!'
There, take the crown, and, with the crown[SEQ_SPLITTER], my curse;
And in thy need such comfort come to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
Hard-hear[SEQ_SPLITTER]ted Clifford, take me from the world:
My soul to h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaven, my blood upon your heads!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
I should [SEQ_SPLITTER]not for my life but weep with him.
To see how inly[SEQ_SPLITTER] sorrow gripes his soul.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, we[SEQ_SPLITTER]eping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
Think but upon[SEQ_SPLITTER] the wrong he did us all,
And that will quickly dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y thy melting tears.

CLIFFORD:
Here's for my oath[SEQ_SPLITTER], here's for my father's death.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd here's to right our gentle-hearted king.

YORK:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
My soul fli[SEQ_SPLITTER]es through these wounds to seek out Thee.

QUEEN M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARGARET:
Off with his head, and set it on York gat[SEQ_SPLITTER]es;
So York may overlook the town of York.
3 KING [SEQ_SPLITTER]HENRY VI

EDWARD:
I wonder how our princely father[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'scaped,
Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
From[SEQ_SPLITTER] Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
Had he b[SEQ_SPLITTER]een ta'en, we should have heard the news;
Had he b[SEQ_SPLITTER]een slain, we should have heard the news;
Or had h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
The happy[SEQ_SPLITTER] tidings of his good escape.
How fares my brother?[SEQ_SPLITTER] why is he so sad?

RICHARD:
I cannot joy, until I[SEQ_SPLITTER] be resolved
Where our right valiant father is bec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome.
I saw him in the battle range about;
And watc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
Methought h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e bore him in the thickest troop
As doth a lion in[SEQ_SPLITTER] a herd of neat;
Or as a bear, encompass'd round w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith dogs,
Who having pinch'd a few and made them c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry,
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
So [SEQ_SPLITTER]fared our father with his enemies;
So fled his ene[SEQ_SPLITTER]mies my warlike father:
Methinks, 'tis prize enoug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h to be his son.
See how the morning opes her gold[SEQ_SPLITTER]en gates,
And takes her farewell of the glorious s[SEQ_SPLITTER]un!
How well resembles it the prime of youth,
Trim[SEQ_SPLITTER]m'd like a younker prancing to his love!

EDWARD:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?

RICHARD[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
Not[SEQ_SPLITTER] separated with the racking clouds,
But sever'd in[SEQ_SPLITTER] a pale clear-shining sky.
See, see! they join, em[SEQ_SPLITTER]brace, and seem to kiss,
As if they vow'd some lea[SEQ_SPLITTER]gue inviolable:
Now are they but one lamp, one lig[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht, one sun.
In this the heaven figures some event[SEQ_SPLITTER].

EDWARD:
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet nev[SEQ_SPLITTER]er heard of.
I think it cites us, brother, to the [SEQ_SPLITTER]field,
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
Eac[SEQ_SPLITTER]h one already blazing by our meeds,
Should notwith[SEQ_SPLITTER]standing join our lights together
And over-shine t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he earth as this the world.
Whate'er it bodes, hen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ceforward will I bear
Upon my target three fair-sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ining suns.

RICHARD:
Nay, bear three daughters: b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y your leave I speak it,
You love the breeder bett[SEQ_SPLITTER]er than the male.
But what art thou, whose heavy l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ooks foretell
Some dreadful story hanging on thy t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ongue?

Messenger:
Ah, one that was a woful looker[SEQ_SPLITTER]-on
When as the noble Duke of York was slain,
Your[SEQ_SPLITTER] princely father and my loving lord!

EDWARD:
O, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]peak no more, for I have heard too much.

RICHARD:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Say how he died, for I will hear it all.

Messeng[SEQ_SPLITTER]er:
Environed he was with many foes,
And stood aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]inst them, as the hope of Troy
Against the Greeks [SEQ_SPLITTER]that would have enter'd Troy.
But Hercules himself[SEQ_SPLITTER] must yield to odds;
And many strokes, though with[SEQ_SPLITTER] a little axe,
Hew down and fell the hardest-timbe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r'd oak.
By many hands your father was subdued;
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
Of unrelentin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g Clifford and the queen,
Who crown'd the gracious[SEQ_SPLITTER] duke in high despite,
Laugh'd in his face; and wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]en with grief he wept,
The ruthless queen gave him[SEQ_SPLITTER] to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmles[SEQ_SPLITTER]s blood
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford [SEQ_SPLITTER]slain:
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey took his head, and on the gates of York
They se[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the same; and there it doth remain,
The saddest [SEQ_SPLITTER]spectacle that e'er I view'd.

EDWARD:
Sweet Duke [SEQ_SPLITTER]of York, our prop to lean upon,
Now thou art gone,[SEQ_SPLITTER] we have no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, boisterous[SEQ_SPLITTER] Clifford! thou hast slain
The flower of Europe fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r his chivalry;
And treacherously hast thou vanqui[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh'd him,
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d thee.
Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]h, would she break from hence, that this my body
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight in the ground be closed up in rest!
For never[SEQ_SPLITTER] henceforth shall I joy again,
Never, O never shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l I see more joy!

RICHARD:
I cannot weep; for all[SEQ_SPLITTER] my body's moisture
Scarce serves to quench my fur[SEQ_SPLITTER]nace-burning heart:
Nor can my tongue unload my he[SEQ_SPLITTER]art's great burthen;
For selfsame wind that I shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y breast,
And burns me up with flames that tears w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould quench.
To weep is to make less the depth of [SEQ_SPLITTER]grief:
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for[SEQ_SPLITTER] me
Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Or die renowned by attempting it.

EDWARD:
His n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ame that valiant duke hath left with thee;
His duk[SEQ_SPLITTER]edom and his chair with me is left.

RICHARD:
Nay,[SEQ_SPLITTER] if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
Show thy d[SEQ_SPLITTER]escent by gazing 'gainst the sun:
For chair and du[SEQ_SPLITTER]kedom, throne and kingdom say;
Either that is thin[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, or else thou wert not his.

WARWICK:
How now, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]air lords! What fare? what news abroad?

RICHARD:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
Our ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]leful news, and at each word's deliverance
Stab po[SEQ_SPLITTER]niards in our flesh till all were told,
The words [SEQ_SPLITTER]would add more anguish than the wounds.
O valiant [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord, the Duke of York is slain!

EDWARD:
O Warwic[SEQ_SPLITTER]k, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
Which held three dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rly as his soul's redemption,
Is by the stern Lord[SEQ_SPLITTER] Clifford done to death.

WARWICK:
Ten days ago I [SEQ_SPLITTER]drown'd these news in tears;
And now, to add more [SEQ_SPLITTER]measure to your woes,
I come to tell you things si[SEQ_SPLITTER]th then befall'n.
After the bloody fray at Wakefie[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld fought,
Where your brave father breathed his la[SEQ_SPLITTER]test gasp,
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could [SEQ_SPLITTER]run,
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I, then in London keeper of the king,
Muster'd my [SEQ_SPLITTER]soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
And very wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l appointed, as I thought,
March'd toward Saint Al[SEQ_SPLITTER]ban's to intercept the queen,
Bearing the king in [SEQ_SPLITTER]my behalf along;
For by my scouts I was advertised[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r late decree in parliament
Touching King Henry's [SEQ_SPLITTER]oath and your succession.
Short tale to make, we a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Saint Alban's met
Our battles join'd, and both s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ides fiercely fought:
But whether 'twas the coldne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss of the king,
Who look'd full gently on his warl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ike queen,
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated[SEQ_SPLITTER] spleen;
Or whether 'twas report of her success;
O[SEQ_SPLITTER]r more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
Who [SEQ_SPLITTER]thunders to his captives blood and death,
I cannot[SEQ_SPLITTER] judge: but to conclude with truth,
Their weapons [SEQ_SPLITTER]like to lightning came and went;
Our soldiers', li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke the night-owl's lazy flight,
Or like an idle th[SEQ_SPLITTER]resher with a flail,
Fell gently down, as if they [SEQ_SPLITTER]struck their friends.
I cheer'd them up with justi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce of our cause,
With promise of high pay and grea[SEQ_SPLITTER]t rewards:
But all in vain; they had no heart to f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight,
And we in them no hope to win the day;
So th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at we fled; the king unto the queen;
Lord George y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our brother, Norfolk and myself,
In haste, post-ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ste, are come to join with you:
For in the marches[SEQ_SPLITTER] here we heard you were,
Making another head to fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght again.

EDWARD:
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, [SEQ_SPLITTER]gentle Warwick?
And when came George from Burgundy[SEQ_SPLITTER] to England?

WARWICK:
Some six miles off the duke[SEQ_SPLITTER] is with the soldiers;
And for your brother, he wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s lately sent
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burg[SEQ_SPLITTER]undy,
With aid of soldiers to this needful war.

R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ICHARD:
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick f[SEQ_SPLITTER]led:
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]ne'er till now his scandal of retire.

WARWICK:
No[SEQ_SPLITTER]r now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
For tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]uck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
And wring [SEQ_SPLITTER]the awful sceptre from his fist,
Were he as famous[SEQ_SPLITTER] and as bold in war
As he is famed for mildness, p[SEQ_SPLITTER]eace, and prayer.

RICHARD:
I know it well, Lord W[SEQ_SPLITTER]arwick; blame me not:
'Tis love I bear thy glories[SEQ_SPLITTER] makes me speak.
But in this troublous time what's[SEQ_SPLITTER] to be done?
Shall we go throw away our coats of s[SEQ_SPLITTER]teel,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
Or shall[SEQ_SPLITTER] we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith revengeful arms?
If for the last, say ay, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]to it, lords.

WARWICK:
Why, therefore Warwick cam[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother [SEQ_SPLITTER]Montague.
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting qu[SEQ_SPLITTER]een,
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And of their feather many more proud birds,
Have w[SEQ_SPLITTER]rought the easy-melting king like wax.
He swore co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nsent to your succession,
His oath enrolled in the[SEQ_SPLITTER] parliament;
And now to London all the crew are go[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne,
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
May[SEQ_SPLITTER] make against the house of Lancaster.
Their power,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I think, is thirty thousand strong:
Now, if the h[SEQ_SPLITTER]elp of Norfolk and myself,
With all the friends th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at thou, brave Earl of March,
Amongst the loving W[SEQ_SPLITTER]elshmen canst procure,
Will but amount to five and[SEQ_SPLITTER] twenty thousand,
Why, Via! to London will we marc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h amain,
And once again bestride our foaming steed[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]never once again turn back and fly.

RICHARD:
Ay, [SEQ_SPLITTER]now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
Ne'er may[SEQ_SPLITTER] he live to see a sunshine day,
That cries 'Retire[SEQ_SPLITTER],' if Warwick bid him stay.

EDWARD:
Lord Warwick,[SEQ_SPLITTER] on thy shoulder will I lean;
And when thou fail's[SEQ_SPLITTER]t--as God forbid the hour!--
Must Edward fall, whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch peril heaven forfend!

WARWICK:
No longer Earl [SEQ_SPLITTER]of March, but Duke of York:
The next degree is Eng[SEQ_SPLITTER]land's royal throne;
For King of England shalt tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u be proclaim'd
In every borough as we pass along;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
Shall f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or the fault make forfeit of his head.
King Edward[SEQ_SPLITTER], valiant Richard, Montague,
Stay we no longer, dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaming of renown,
But sound the trumpets, and abou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t our task.

RICHARD:
Then, Clifford, were thy hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt as hard as steel,
As thou hast shown it flinty [SEQ_SPLITTER]by thy deeds,
I come to pierce it, or to give thee[SEQ_SPLITTER] mine.

EDWARD:
Then strike up drums: God and Sain[SEQ_SPLITTER]t George for us!

WARWICK:
How now! what news?

Me[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssenger:
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The queen is coming with a puissant host;
And cra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ves your company for speedy counsel.

WARWICK:
Why[SEQ_SPLITTER] then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.
3 KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] HENRY VI

QUEEN MARGARET:
Welcome, my lord, to th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is brave town of York.
Yonder's the head of that a[SEQ_SPLITTER]rch-enemy
That sought to be encompass'd with your [SEQ_SPLITTER]crown:
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd?

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, as the rocks cheer them th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at fear their wreck:
To see this sight, it irks my[SEQ_SPLITTER] very soul.
Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y fault,
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]LIFFORD:
My gracious liege, this too much lenity
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd harmful pity must be laid aside.
To whom do lio[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns cast their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that [SEQ_SPLITTER]would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the fore[SEQ_SPLITTER]st bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils her young b[SEQ_SPLITTER]efore her face.
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's [SEQ_SPLITTER]mortal sting?
Not he that sets his foot upon her b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ack.
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
Thou smili[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng while he knit his angry brows:
He, but a duke, [SEQ_SPLITTER]would have his son a king,
And raise his issue, li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke a loving sire;
Thou, being a king, blest with a[SEQ_SPLITTER] goodly son,
Didst yield consent to disinherit him[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Unreas[SEQ_SPLITTER]onable creatures feed their young;
And though man'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s face be fearful to their eyes,
Yet, in protectio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n of their tender ones,
Who hath not seen them, ev[SEQ_SPLITTER]en with those wings
Which sometime they have used [SEQ_SPLITTER]with fearful flight,
Make war with him that climb'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d unto their nest,
Offer their own lives in their [SEQ_SPLITTER]young's defence?
For shame, my liege, make them yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur precedent!
Were it not pity that this goodly bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault[SEQ_SPLITTER],
And long hereafter say unto his child,
'What my [SEQ_SPLITTER]great-grandfather and his grandsire got
My careles[SEQ_SPLITTER]s father fondly gave away'?
Ah, what a shame were [SEQ_SPLITTER]this! Look on the boy;
And let his manly face, whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting[SEQ_SPLITTER] heart
To hold thine own and leave thine own with [SEQ_SPLITTER]him.

KING HENRY VI:
Full well hath Clifford play'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d the orator,
Inferring arguments of mighty force.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t things ill-got had ever bad success?
And happy a[SEQ_SPLITTER]lways was it for that son
Whose father for his hoa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rding went to hell?
I'll leave my son my virtuous [SEQ_SPLITTER]deeds behind;
And would my father had left me no m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore!
For all the rest is held at such a rate
As br[SEQ_SPLITTER]ings a thousand-fold more care to keep
Than in pos[SEQ_SPLITTER]session and jot of pleasure.
Ah, cousin York! woul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d thy best friends did know
How it doth grieve me [SEQ_SPLITTER]that thy head is here!

QUEEN MARGARET:
My lord, c[SEQ_SPLITTER]heer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
And this [SEQ_SPLITTER]soft courage makes your followers faint.
You promi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sed knighthood to our forward son:
Unsheathe your [SEQ_SPLITTER]sword, and dub him presently.
Edward, kneel down.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
KING HENRY VI:
Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight[SEQ_SPLITTER];
And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
PRINCE:
My gracious father, by your kingly leave,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
And in tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t quarrel use it to the death.

CLIFFORD:
Why, tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t is spoken like a toward prince.

Messenger:
Roya[SEQ_SPLITTER]l commanders, be in readiness:
For with a band of [SEQ_SPLITTER]thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick, backing of the [SEQ_SPLITTER]Duke of York;
And in the towns, as they do march a[SEQ_SPLITTER]long,
Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:
Dar[SEQ_SPLITTER]raign your battle, for they are at hand.

CLIFFORD[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I would your highness would depart the field:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e queen hath best success when you are absent.

QU[SEQ_SPLITTER]EEN MARGARET:
Ay, good my lord, and leave us to ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r fortune.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, that's my fortune [SEQ_SPLITTER]too; therefore I'll stay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be it w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith resolution then to fight.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My r[SEQ_SPLITTER]oyal father, cheer these noble lords
And hearten t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hose that fight in your defence:
Unsheathe your sw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord, good father; cry 'Saint George!'

EDWARD:
Now[SEQ_SPLITTER], perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
And s[SEQ_SPLITTER]et thy diadem upon my head;
Or bide the mortal for[SEQ_SPLITTER]tune of the field?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, rate thy m[SEQ_SPLITTER]inions, proud insulting boy!
Becomes it thee to be[SEQ_SPLITTER] thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy l[SEQ_SPLITTER]awful king?

EDWARD:
I am his king, and he should [SEQ_SPLITTER]bow his knee;
I was adopted heir by his consent:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]ince when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
You,[SEQ_SPLITTER] that are king, though he do wear the crown,
Have [SEQ_SPLITTER]caused him, by new act of parliament,
To blot out [SEQ_SPLITTER]me, and put his own son in.

CLIFFORD:
And reason [SEQ_SPLITTER]too:
Who should succeed the father but the son?

R[SEQ_SPLITTER]ICHARD:
Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak![SEQ_SPLITTER]

CLIFFORD:
Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer[SEQ_SPLITTER] thee,
Or any he the proudest of thy sort.

RICHAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]D:
'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

CLIFFORD:
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed.

RICHARD:
For God's sake, lords, give signal t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o the fight.

WARWICK:
What say'st thou, Henry, wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]lt thou yield the crown?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, how[SEQ_SPLITTER] now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
When y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou and I met at Saint Alban's last,
Your legs did [SEQ_SPLITTER]better service than your hands.

WARWICK:
Then 'tw[SEQ_SPLITTER]as my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.

CLIFFORD:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]You said so much before, and yet you fled.

WARWIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]K:
'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thenc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, nor your manhood that durs[SEQ_SPLITTER]t make you stay.

RICHARD:
Northumberland, I hold [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee reverently.
Break off the parley; for scarce [SEQ_SPLITTER]I can refrain
The execution of my big-swoln heart
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.

CLIF[SEQ_SPLITTER]FORD:
I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

RICHARD:
Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous co[SEQ_SPLITTER]ward,
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutlan[SEQ_SPLITTER]d;
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING HENRY VI:
Have done with words, my lords, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] hear me speak.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Defy them then, o[SEQ_SPLITTER]r else hold close thy lips.

KING HENRY VI:
I prit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee, give no limits to my tongue:
I am a king, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] privileged to speak.

CLIFFORD:
My liege, the wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd that bred this meeting here
Cannot be cured by [SEQ_SPLITTER]words; therefore be still.

RICHARD:
Then, executi[SEQ_SPLITTER]oner, unsheathe thy sword:
By him that made us all[SEQ_SPLITTER], I am resolved
that Clifford's manhood lies upon [SEQ_SPLITTER]his tongue.

EDWARD:
Say, Henry, shall I have my r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight, or no?
A thousand men have broke their fasts[SEQ_SPLITTER] to-day,
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he crown.

WARWICK:
If thou deny, their blood upon[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy head;
For York in justice puts his armour on.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PRINCE EDWARD:
If that be right which Warwick sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ys is right,
There is no wrong, but every thing is[SEQ_SPLITTER] right.

RICHARD:
Whoever got thee, there thy moth[SEQ_SPLITTER]er stands;
For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's[SEQ_SPLITTER] tongue.

QUEEN MARGARET:
But thou art neither lik[SEQ_SPLITTER]e thy sire nor dam;
But like a foul mis-shapen sti[SEQ_SPLITTER]gmatic,
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
As [SEQ_SPLITTER]venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.

RICHARD[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
Whose fath[SEQ_SPLITTER]er bears the title of a king,--
As if a channel sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould be call'd the sea,--
Shamest thou not, knowin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g whence thou art extraught,
To let thy tongue det[SEQ_SPLITTER]ect thy base-born heart?

EDWARD:
A wisp of straw [SEQ_SPLITTER]were worth a thousand crowns,
To make this shamele[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss callet know herself.
Helen of Greece was fairer[SEQ_SPLITTER] far than thou,
Although thy husband may be Menela[SEQ_SPLITTER]us;
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
By t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat false woman, as this king by thee.
His father [SEQ_SPLITTER]revell'd in the heart of France,
And tamed the kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g, and made the dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]according to his state,
He might have kept that gl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ory to this day;
But when he took a beggar to his [SEQ_SPLITTER]bed,
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
For wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
Hadst t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou been meek, our title still had slept;
And we, [SEQ_SPLITTER]in pity of the gentle king,
Had slipp'd our claim [SEQ_SPLITTER]until another age.

GEORGE:
But when we saw our su[SEQ_SPLITTER]nshine made thy spring,
And that thy summer bred u[SEQ_SPLITTER]s no increase,
We set the axe to thy usurping root[SEQ_SPLITTER];
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]e'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
Or b[SEQ_SPLITTER]athed thy growing with our heated bloods.

EDWARD:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
Not willing[SEQ_SPLITTER] any longer conference,
Since thou deniest the gen[SEQ_SPLITTER]tle king to speak.
Sound trumpets! let our bloody [SEQ_SPLITTER]colours wave!
And either victory, or else a grave.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

QUEEN MARGARET:
Stay, Edward.

EDWARD:
No, wrang[SEQ_SPLITTER]ling woman, we'll no longer stay:
These words will[SEQ_SPLITTER] cost ten thousand lives this day.
3 KING HENRY VI[SEQ_SPLITTER]

WARWICK:
Forspent with toil, as runners with a r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace,
I lay me down a little while to breathe;
For [SEQ_SPLITTER]strokes received, and many blows repaid,
Have robb[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
And sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ite of spite needs must I rest awhile.

EDWARD:
Sm[SEQ_SPLITTER]ile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]WARWICK:
How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of [SEQ_SPLITTER]good?

GEORGE:
Our hap is loss, our hope but sad d[SEQ_SPLITTER]espair;
Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?

EDWA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD:
Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.

RICHARD[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
Br[SEQ_SPLITTER]oach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And in the very pangs of death he cried,
Like to a[SEQ_SPLITTER] dismal clangour heard from far,
'Warwick, revenge[SEQ_SPLITTER]! brother, revenge my death!'
So, underneath the b[SEQ_SPLITTER]elly of their steeds,
That stain'd their fetlocks [SEQ_SPLITTER]in his smoking blood,
The noble gentleman gave up [SEQ_SPLITTER]the ghost.

WARWICK:
Then let the earth be drunken[SEQ_SPLITTER] with our blood:
I'll kill my horse, because I wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l not fly.
Why stand we like soft-hearted women he[SEQ_SPLITTER]re,
Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And look upon, as if the tragedy
Were play'd in je[SEQ_SPLITTER]st by counterfeiting actors?
Here on my knee I vow[SEQ_SPLITTER] to God above,
I'll never pause again, never stand[SEQ_SPLITTER] still,
Till either death hath closed these eyes o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f mine
Or fortune given me measure of revenge.

ED[SEQ_SPLITTER]WARD:
O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
And, ere m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y knee rise from the earth's cold face,
I throw my[SEQ_SPLITTER] hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,
Thou setter u[SEQ_SPLITTER]p and plucker down of kings,
Beseeching thee, if w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith they will it stands
That to my foes this body [SEQ_SPLITTER]must be prey,
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven [SEQ_SPLITTER]may ope,
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul![SEQ_SPLITTER]
Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
Where[SEQ_SPLITTER]'er it be, in heaven or in earth.

RICHARD:
Brothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
Let me e[SEQ_SPLITTER]mbrace thee in my weary arms:
I, that did never we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ep, now melt with woe
That winter should cut off o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur spring-time so.

WARWICK:
Away, away! Once more[SEQ_SPLITTER], sweet lords farewell.

GEORGE:
Yet let us all to[SEQ_SPLITTER]gether to our troops,
And give them leave to fly t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat will not stay;
And call them pillars that will[SEQ_SPLITTER] stand to us;
And, if we thrive, promise them such[SEQ_SPLITTER] rewards
As victors wear at the Olympian games:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is may plant courage in their quailing breasts;
Fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r yet is hope of life and victory.
Forslow no long[SEQ_SPLITTER]er, make we hence amain.
3 KING HENRY VI

RICHARD:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:
Suppose[SEQ_SPLITTER] this arm is for the Duke of York,
And this for Ru[SEQ_SPLITTER]tland; both bound to revenge,
Wert thou environ'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]with a brazen wall.

CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, I am [SEQ_SPLITTER]with thee here alone:
This is the hand that stabb'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d thy father York;
And this the hand that slew thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] brother Rutland;
And here's the heart that triump[SEQ_SPLITTER]hs in their death
And cheers these hands that slew[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy sire and brother
To execute the like upon thy[SEQ_SPLITTER]self;
And so, have at thee!

RICHARD:
Nay Warwick,[SEQ_SPLITTER] single out some other chase;
For I myself will hu[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt this wolf to death.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING HENRY[SEQ_SPLITTER] VI:
This battle fares like to the morning's war,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]When dying clouds contend with growing light,
What[SEQ_SPLITTER] time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
Can neit[SEQ_SPLITTER]her call it perfect day nor night.
Now sways it th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is way, like a mighty sea
Forced by the tide to co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mbat with the wind;
Now sways it that way, like th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e selfsame sea
Forced to retire by fury of the win[SEQ_SPLITTER]d:
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Now one the better, then another best;
Both tuggi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng to be victors, breast to breast,
Yet neither co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nqueror nor conquered:
So is the equal of this fel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l war.
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o whom God will, there be the victory!
For Margare[SEQ_SPLITTER]t my queen, and Clifford too,
Have chid me from th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e battle; swearing both
They prosper best of all w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen I am thence.
Would I were dead! if God's good [SEQ_SPLITTER]will were so;
For what is in this world but grief [SEQ_SPLITTER]and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]be no better than a homely swain;
To sit upon a hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll, as I do now,
To carve out dials quaintly, poin[SEQ_SPLITTER]t by point,
Thereby to see the minutes how they ru[SEQ_SPLITTER]n,
How many make the hour full complete;
How many [SEQ_SPLITTER]hours bring about the day;
How many days will fini[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh up the year;
How many years a mortal man may li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve.
When this is known, then to divide the times:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]So many hours must I tend my flock;
So many hours [SEQ_SPLITTER]must I take my rest;
So many hours must I contempl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate;
So many hours must I sport myself;
So many da[SEQ_SPLITTER]ys my ewes have been with young;
So many weeks ere[SEQ_SPLITTER] the poor fools will ean:
So many years ere I shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l shear the fleece:
So minutes, hours, days, month[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, and years,
Pass'd over to the end they were cre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ated,
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
To she[SEQ_SPLITTER]pherds looking on their silly sheep,
Than doth a r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich embroider'd canopy
To kings that fear their su[SEQ_SPLITTER]bjects' treachery?
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fol[SEQ_SPLITTER]d it doth.
And to conclude, the shepherd's homely [SEQ_SPLITTER]curds,
His cold thin drink out of his leather bott[SEQ_SPLITTER]le.
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
Is far beyo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd a prince's delicates,
His viands sparkling in a[SEQ_SPLITTER] golden cup,
His body couched in a curious bed,
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]en care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

Son:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
This man,[SEQ_SPLITTER] whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
May be possess[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed with some store of crowns;
And I, that haply ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke them from him now,
May yet ere night yield both[SEQ_SPLITTER] my life and them
To some man else, as this dead m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an doth me.
Who's this? O God! it is my father's f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace,
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]O heavy times, begetting such events!
From London [SEQ_SPLITTER]by the king was I press'd forth;
My father, being [SEQ_SPLITTER]the Earl of Warwick's man,
Came on the part of Yor[SEQ_SPLITTER]k, press'd by his master;
And I, who at his hands [SEQ_SPLITTER]received my life, him
Have by my hands of life ber[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaved him.
Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
My tears [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall wipe away these bloody marks;
And no more wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rds till they have flow'd their fill.

KING HENRY [SEQ_SPLITTER]VI:
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
Whiles li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ons war and battle for their dens,
Poor harmless l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ambs abide their enmity.
Weep, wretched man, I'll [SEQ_SPLITTER]aid thee tear for tear;
And let our hearts and eye[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, like civil war,
Be blind with tears, and break [SEQ_SPLITTER]o'ercharged with grief.

Father:
Thou that so stou[SEQ_SPLITTER]tly hast resisted me,
Give me thy gold, if thou ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]st any gold:
For I have bought it with an hundred [SEQ_SPLITTER]blows.
But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
Ah, boy, if a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ny life be left in thee,
Throw up thine eye! see, [SEQ_SPLITTER]see what showers arise,
Blown with the windy tempe[SEQ_SPLITTER]st of my heart,
Upon thy words, that kill mine eye[SEQ_SPLITTER] and heart!
O, pity, God, this miserable age!
What[SEQ_SPLITTER] stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,
Erroneous, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]utinous and unnatural,
This deadly quarrel daily d[SEQ_SPLITTER]oth beget!
O boy, thy father gave thee life too so[SEQ_SPLITTER]on,
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!

KI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NG HENRY VI:
Woe above woe! grief more than common[SEQ_SPLITTER] grief!
O that my death would stay these ruthful d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eeds!
O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
The red r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ose and the white are on his face,
The fatal colou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs of our striving houses:
The one his purple bloo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d right well resembles;
The other his pale cheeks,[SEQ_SPLITTER] methinks, presenteth:
Wither one rose, and let th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e other flourish;
If you contend, a thousand lives[SEQ_SPLITTER] must wither.

Son:
How will my mother for a fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's death
Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Father:
How will my wife for slaughter of my son
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!

KING H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENRY VI:
How will the country for these woful chan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ces
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!

Son:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Was ever son so rued a father's death?

Father:
Wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s ever father so bemoan'd his son?

KING HENRY VI:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Much [SEQ_SPLITTER]is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.

Son:
I'll[SEQ_SPLITTER] bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.

Fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r:
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,
For f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom my heart thine image ne'er shall go;
My sighin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g breast shall be thy funeral bell;
And so obsequi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous will thy father be,
Even for the loss of thee,[SEQ_SPLITTER] having no more,
As Priam was for all his valiant [SEQ_SPLITTER]sons.
I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t will,
For I have murdered where I should not kil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l.

KING HENRY VI:
Sad-hearted men, much overgone [SEQ_SPLITTER]with care,
Here sits a king more woful than you ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Fly, father, fly! for all your [SEQ_SPLITTER]friends are fled,
And Warwick rages like a chafed [SEQ_SPLITTER]bull:
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.

QU[SEQ_SPLITTER]EEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick [SEQ_SPLITTER]post amain:
Edward and Richard, like a brace of gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eyhounds
Having the fearful flying hare in sight,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,
And bloo[SEQ_SPLITTER]dy steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
Are at our[SEQ_SPLITTER] backs; and therefore hence amain.

EXETER:
Away! [SEQ_SPLITTER]for vengeance comes along with them:
Nay, stay not[SEQ_SPLITTER] to expostulate, make speed;
Or else come after: I[SEQ_SPLITTER]'ll away before.

KING HENRY VI:
Nay, take me with[SEQ_SPLITTER] thee, good sweet Exeter:
Not that I fear to stay,[SEQ_SPLITTER] but love to go
Whither the queen intends. Forward[SEQ_SPLITTER]; away!
3 KING HENRY VI

CLIFFORD:
Here burns my c[SEQ_SPLITTER]andle out; ay, here it dies,
Which, whiles it last[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed, gave King Henry light.
O Lancaster, I fear thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] overthrow
More than my body's parting with my sou[SEQ_SPLITTER]l!
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
Impairi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng Henry, strengthening misproud York,
The common [SEQ_SPLITTER]people swarm like summer flies;
And whither fly th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e gnats but to the sun?
And who shines now but Hen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry's enemies?
O Phoebus, hadst thou never given co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nsent
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
Or[SEQ_SPLITTER] as thy father and his father did,
Giving no groun[SEQ_SPLITTER]d unto the house of York,
They never then had spru[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng like summer flies;
I and ten thousand in this l[SEQ_SPLITTER]uckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our [SEQ_SPLITTER]death;
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in p[SEQ_SPLITTER]eace.
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]o way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] foe is merciless, and will not pity;
For at their[SEQ_SPLITTER] hands I have deserved no pity.
The air hath got i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nto my deadly wounds,
And much effuse of blood dot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h make me faint.
Come, York and Richard, Warwick a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd the rest;
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split[SEQ_SPLITTER] my breast.

EDWARD:
Now breathe we, lords: good f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ortune bids us pause,
And smooth the frowns of war[SEQ_SPLITTER] with peaceful looks.
Some troops pursue the blood[SEQ_SPLITTER]y-minded queen,
That led calm Henry, though he wer[SEQ_SPLITTER]e a king,
As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust,
Command an argosy to stem the waves.
But thin[SEQ_SPLITTER]k you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?

WARWI[SEQ_SPLITTER]CK:
No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
For, tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ugh before his face I speak the words
Your brother[SEQ_SPLITTER] Richard mark'd him for the grave:
And wheresoe'er[SEQ_SPLITTER] he is, he's surely dead.

EDWARD:
Whose soul is t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat which takes her heavy leave?

RICHARD:
A deadl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y groan, like life and death's departing.

EDWARD:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
If fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iend or foe, let him be gently used.

RICHARD:
Rev[SEQ_SPLITTER]oke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
Who not[SEQ_SPLITTER] contented that he lopp'd the branch
In hewing Rut[SEQ_SPLITTER]land when his leaves put forth,
But set his murder[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing knife unto the root
From whence that tender sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ray did sweetly spring,
I mean our princely father[SEQ_SPLITTER], Duke of York.

WARWICK:
From off the gates of Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rk fetch down the head,
Your father's head, which [SEQ_SPLITTER]Clifford placed there;
Instead whereof let this su[SEQ_SPLITTER]pply the room:
Measure for measure must be answere[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.

EDWARD:
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to [SEQ_SPLITTER]our house,
That nothing sung but death to us and o[SEQ_SPLITTER]urs:
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ound,
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall spea[SEQ_SPLITTER]k.

WARWICK:
I think his understanding is bereft.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.

RICHARD[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
'Tis bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t his policy to counterfeit,
Because he would avoi[SEQ_SPLITTER]d such bitter taunts
Which in the time of death he[SEQ_SPLITTER] gave our father.

GEORGE:
If so thou think'st, ve[SEQ_SPLITTER]x him with eager words.

RICHARD:
Clifford, ask me[SEQ_SPLITTER]rcy and obtain no grace.

EDWARD:
Clifford, repent[SEQ_SPLITTER] in bootless penitence.

WARWICK:
Clifford, devise[SEQ_SPLITTER] excuses for thy faults.

GEORGE:
While we devise [SEQ_SPLITTER]fell tortures for thy faults.

RICHARD:
Thou didst[SEQ_SPLITTER] love York, and I am son to York.

EDWARD:
Thou pi[SEQ_SPLITTER]tied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.

GEORGE:
Where'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s Captain Margaret, to fence you now?

WARWICK:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]RICHARD:
What, not an oath? nay, then the world go[SEQ_SPLITTER]es hard
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an [SEQ_SPLITTER]oath.
I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]f this right hand would buy two hour's life,
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]I in all despite might rail at him,
This hand shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld chop it off, and with the
issuing blood
Stifle [SEQ_SPLITTER]the villain whose unstanched thirst
York and young[SEQ_SPLITTER] Rutland could not satisfy.

WARWICK:
Ay, but he's[SEQ_SPLITTER] dead: off with the traitor's head,
And rear it in[SEQ_SPLITTER] the place your father's stands.
And now to London[SEQ_SPLITTER] with triumphant march,
There to be crowned Englan[SEQ_SPLITTER]d's royal king:
From whence shall Warwick cut the [SEQ_SPLITTER]sea to France,
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
For t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hough they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
Yet look [SEQ_SPLITTER]to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
First will[SEQ_SPLITTER] I see the coronation;
And then to Brittany I'll c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ross the sea,
To effect this marriage, so it pleas[SEQ_SPLITTER]e my lord.

EDWARD:
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck, let it be;
For in thy shoulder do I build my s[SEQ_SPLITTER]eat,
And never will I undertake the thing
Wherein [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy counsel and consent is wanting.
Richard, I wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l create thee Duke of Gloucester,
And George, of C[SEQ_SPLITTER]larence: Warwick, as ourself,
Shall do and undo as[SEQ_SPLITTER] him pleaseth best.

RICHARD:
Let me be Duke of Cl[SEQ_SPLITTER]arence, George of Gloucester;
For Gloucester's duk[SEQ_SPLITTER]edom is too ominous.

WARWICK:
Tut, that's a fooli[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh observation:
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. No[SEQ_SPLITTER]w to London,
To see these honours in possession.
3[SEQ_SPLITTER] KING HENRY VI

First Keeper:
Under this thick-gro[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn brake we'll shroud ourselves;
For through this [SEQ_SPLITTER]laund anon the deer will come;
And in this covert [SEQ_SPLITTER]will we make our stand,
Culling the principal of a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll the deer.

Second Keeper:
I'll stay above the h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill, so both may shoot.

First Keeper:
That cannot[SEQ_SPLITTER] be; the noise of thy cross-bow
Will scare the her[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, and so my shoot is lost.
Here stand we both, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d aim we at the best:
And, for the time shall not [SEQ_SPLITTER]seem tedious,
I'll tell thee what befell me on a d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay
In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Second Keeper:
Here comes a man; let's stay till [SEQ_SPLITTER]he be past.

KING HENRY VI:
From Scotland am I sto[SEQ_SPLITTER]l'n, even of pure love,
To greet mine own land wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h my wishful sight.
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land[SEQ_SPLITTER] of thine;
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung [SEQ_SPLITTER]from thee,
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast[SEQ_SPLITTER] anointed:
No bending knee will call thee Caesar n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow,
No humble suitors press to speak for right,
No[SEQ_SPLITTER], not a man comes for redress of thee;
For how can[SEQ_SPLITTER] I help them, and not myself?

First Keeper:
Ay, h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:
This is [SEQ_SPLITTER]the quondam king; let's seize upon him.

KING HENR[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y VI:
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
For wis[SEQ_SPLITTER]e men say it is the wisest course.

Second Keeper:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.

First [SEQ_SPLITTER]Keeper:
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
KING HENRY VI:
My queen and son are gone to Franc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e for aid;
And, as I hear, the great commanding Wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rwick
Is thither gone, to crave the French king's [SEQ_SPLITTER]sister
To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
P[SEQ_SPLITTER]oor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
For Wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rwick is a subtle orator,
And Lewis a prince soon [SEQ_SPLITTER]won with moving words.
By this account then Margar[SEQ_SPLITTER]et may win him;
For she's a woman to be pitied muc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h:
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
He[SEQ_SPLITTER]r tears will pierce into a marble heart;
The tiger[SEQ_SPLITTER] will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
And Nero will[SEQ_SPLITTER] be tainted with remorse,
To hear and see her plai[SEQ_SPLITTER]nts, her brinish tears.
Ay, but she's come to beg,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Warwick to give;
She, on his left side, craving a[SEQ_SPLITTER]id for Henry,
He, on his right, asking a wife for [SEQ_SPLITTER]Edward.
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
Whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]les Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
In[SEQ_SPLITTER]ferreth arguments of mighty strength,
And in concl[SEQ_SPLITTER]usion wins the king from her,
With promise of his [SEQ_SPLITTER]sister, and what else,
To strengthen and support K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing Edward's place.
O Margaret, thus 'twill be; an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d thou, poor soul,
Art then forsaken, as thou went[SEQ_SPLITTER]'st forlorn!

Second Keeper:
Say, what art thou th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at talk'st of kings and queens?

KING HENRY VI:
Mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re than I seem, and less than I was born to:
A man[SEQ_SPLITTER] at least, for less I should not be;
And men may t[SEQ_SPLITTER]alk of kings, and why not I?

Second Keeper:
Ay, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.

KING HENR[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y VI:
Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.

S[SEQ_SPLITTER]econd Keeper:
But, if thou be a king, where is thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] crown?

KING HENRY VI:
My crown is in my heart, n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot on my head;
Not decked with diamonds and Indian[SEQ_SPLITTER] stones,
Nor to be seen: my crown is called conten[SEQ_SPLITTER]t:
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.

Second [SEQ_SPLITTER]Keeper:
Well, if you be a king crown'd with conten[SEQ_SPLITTER]t,
Your crown content and you must be contented
To[SEQ_SPLITTER] go along with us; for as we think,
You are the ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng King Edward hath deposed;
And we his subjects s[SEQ_SPLITTER]worn in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his e[SEQ_SPLITTER]nemy.

KING HENRY VI:
But did you never swear, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] break an oath?

Second Keeper:
No, never such an [SEQ_SPLITTER]oath; nor will not now.

KING HENRY VI:
Where did [SEQ_SPLITTER]you dwell when I was King of England?

Second Keep[SEQ_SPLITTER]er:
Here in this country, where we now remain.

KI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NG HENRY VI:
I was anointed king at nine months ol[SEQ_SPLITTER]d;
My father and my grandfather were kings,
And yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u were sworn true subjects unto me:
And tell me, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen, have you not broke your oaths?

First Keeper:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
No;
For we were subjects but while you were king.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KING HENRY VI:
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe [SEQ_SPLITTER]a man?
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear[SEQ_SPLITTER]!
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
And a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the air blows it to me again,
Obeying with my wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd when I do blow,
And yielding to another when it[SEQ_SPLITTER] blows,
Commanded always by the greater gust;
Such[SEQ_SPLITTER] is the lightness of you common men.
But do not br[SEQ_SPLITTER]eak your oaths; for of that sin
My mild entreaty s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall not make you guilty.
Go where you will, the k[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing shall be commanded;
And be you kings, command,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and I'll obey.

First Keeper:
We are true subject[SEQ_SPLITTER]s to the king, King Edward.

KING HENRY VI:
So wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld you be again to Henry,
If he were seated as Kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g Edward is.

First Keeper:
We charge you, in God'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s name, and the king's,
To go with us unto the off[SEQ_SPLITTER]icers.

KING HENRY VI:
In God's name, lead; your k[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing's name be obey'd:
And what God will, that let [SEQ_SPLITTER]your king perform;
And what he will, I humbly yiel[SEQ_SPLITTER]d unto.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Brother o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
This lady's h[SEQ_SPLITTER]usband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
His lands the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n seized on by the conqueror:
Her suit is now to r[SEQ_SPLITTER]epossess those lands;
Which we in justice cannot w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell deny,
Because in quarrel of the house of York
[SEQ_SPLITTER]The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

GLOUCESTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]R:
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]It were dishonour to deny it her.

KING EDWARD IV:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.

GLOU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CESTER:

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]idow, we will consider of your suit;
And come some[SEQ_SPLITTER] other time to know our mind.

LADY GREY:
Right gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]acious lord, I cannot brook delay:
May it please y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our highness to resolve me now;
And what your plea[SEQ_SPLITTER]sure is, shall satisfy me.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:[SEQ_SPLITTER]

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
How many children h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ast thou, widow? tell me.

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
LADY GREY:
Three, my most gracious lord.

GLOUCES[SEQ_SPLITTER]TER:

KING EDWARD IV:
'Twere pity they should lose[SEQ_SPLITTER] their father's lands.

LADY GREY:
Be pitiful, dre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad lord, and grant it then.

KING EDWARD IV:
Lords[SEQ_SPLITTER], give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.

GLOUC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now tell me, madam, do you[SEQ_SPLITTER] love your children?

LADY GREY:
Ay, full as dearl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y as I love myself.

KING EDWARD IV:
And would you[SEQ_SPLITTER] not do much to do them good?

LADY GREY:
To do th[SEQ_SPLITTER]em good, I would sustain some harm.

KING EDWARD I[SEQ_SPLITTER]V:
Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

LADY GREY:
Therefore I came unto your majesty.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING EDWARD IV:
I'll tell you how these lands are [SEQ_SPLITTER]to be got.

LADY GREY:
So shall you bind me to you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r highness' service.

KING EDWARD IV:
What service[SEQ_SPLITTER] wilt thou do me, if I give them?

LADY GREY:
What[SEQ_SPLITTER] you command, that rests in me to do.

KING EDWARD[SEQ_SPLITTER] IV:
But you will take exceptions to my boon.

LAD[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y GREY:
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but thou canst do what I mean[SEQ_SPLITTER] to ask.

LADY GREY:
Why, then I will do what your[SEQ_SPLITTER] grace commands.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:

LADY GRE[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y:
Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING EDWARD IV:
An easy task; 'tis but to love a ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng.

LADY GREY:
That's soon perform'd, because I a[SEQ_SPLITTER]m a subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then, thy husba[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd's lands I freely give thee.

LADY GREY:
I take [SEQ_SPLITTER]my leave with many thousand thanks.

GLOUCESTER:

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING EDWARD IV:
But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of [SEQ_SPLITTER]love I mean.

LADY GREY:
The fruits of love I mean[SEQ_SPLITTER], my loving liege.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, but, I fea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r me, in another sense.
What love, think'st thou, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I sue so much to get?

LADY GREY:
My love till dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]th, my humble thanks, my prayers;
That love which [SEQ_SPLITTER]virtue begs and virtue grants.

KING EDWARD IV:
No[SEQ_SPLITTER], by my troth, I did not mean such love.

LADY GRE[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y:
Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING EDWARD IV:
But now you partly may perceive my [SEQ_SPLITTER]mind.

LADY GREY:
My mind will never grant what I [SEQ_SPLITTER]perceive
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING EDWARD IV:
To tell thee plain, I aim to lie w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith thee.

LADY GREY:
To tell you plain, I had rat[SEQ_SPLITTER]her lie in prison.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, then thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] shalt not have thy husband's lands.

LADY GREY:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
For by th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at loss I will not purchase them.

KING EDWARD IV:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.

LAD[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y GREY:
Herein your highness wrongs both them and [SEQ_SPLITTER]me.
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
Accor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds not with the sadness of my suit:
Please you dis[SEQ_SPLITTER]miss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'

KING EDWARD IV:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
No if th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou dost say 'no' to my demand.

LADY GREY:
Then, n[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, my lord. My suit is at an end.

GLOUCESTER:

CL[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARENCE:

KING EDWARD IV:

LADY GREY:
'Tis better s[SEQ_SPLITTER]aid than done, my gracious lord:
I am a subject fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]t to jest withal,
But far unfit to be a sovereign.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KING EDWARD IV:
Sweet widow, by my state I swear[SEQ_SPLITTER] to thee
I speak no more than what my soul intends[SEQ_SPLITTER];
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.

LADY GR[SEQ_SPLITTER]EY:
And that is more than I will yield unto:
I kno[SEQ_SPLITTER]w I am too mean to be your queen,
And yet too good[SEQ_SPLITTER] to be your concubine.

KING EDWARD IV:
You cavil,[SEQ_SPLITTER] widow: I did mean, my queen.

LADY GREY:
'Twill g[SEQ_SPLITTER]rieve your grace my sons should call you father.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING EDWARD IV:
No more than when my daughters cal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l thee mother.
Thou art a widow, and thou hast som[SEQ_SPLITTER]e children;
And, by God's mother, I, being but a b[SEQ_SPLITTER]achelor,
Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To be the father unto many sons.
Answer no more, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or thou shalt be my queen.

GLOUCESTER:

CLARENCE:[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KING EDWARD IV:
Brothers, you muse what chat we [SEQ_SPLITTER]two have had.

GLOUCESTER:
The widow likes it not,[SEQ_SPLITTER] for she looks very sad.

KING EDWARD IV:
You'll t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hink it strange if I should marry her.

CLARENCE:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To whom, my lord?

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, Clarence, [SEQ_SPLITTER]to myself.

GLOUCESTER:
That would be ten days' wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nder at the least.

CLARENCE:
That's a day longer [SEQ_SPLITTER]than a wonder lasts.

GLOUCESTER:
By so much is th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e wonder in extremes.

KING EDWARD IV:
Well, jest [SEQ_SPLITTER]on, brothers: I can tell you both
Her suit is gran[SEQ_SPLITTER]ted for her husband's lands.

Nobleman:
My graciou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s lord, Henry your foe is taken,
And brought your [SEQ_SPLITTER]prisoner to your palace gate.

KING EDWARD IV:
See[SEQ_SPLITTER] that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
And go we, br[SEQ_SPLITTER]others, to the man that took him,
To question of h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is apprehension.
Widow, go you along. Lords, use h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er honourably.

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, Edward will use wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]men honourably.
Would he were wasted, marrow, bone[SEQ_SPLITTER]s and all,
That from his loins no hopeful branch m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay spring,
To cross me from the golden time I look[SEQ_SPLITTER] for!
And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he lustful Edward's title buried--
Is Clarence, He[SEQ_SPLITTER]nry, and his son young Edward,
And all the unlook'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d for issue of their bodies,
To take their rooms, [SEQ_SPLITTER]ere I can place myself:
A cold premeditation for m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y purpose!
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignt[SEQ_SPLITTER]y;
Like one that stands upon a promontory,
And spi[SEQ_SPLITTER]es a far-off shore where he would tread,
Wishing h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is foot were equal with his eye,
And chides the se[SEQ_SPLITTER]a that sunders him from thence,
Saying, he'll lade[SEQ_SPLITTER] it dry to have his way:
So do I wish the crown, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eing so far off;
And so I chide the means that kee[SEQ_SPLITTER]ps me from it;
And so I say, I'll cut the causes o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ff,
Flattering me with impossibilities.
My eye's t[SEQ_SPLITTER]oo quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
Unless my h[SEQ_SPLITTER]and and strength could equal them.
Well, say there[SEQ_SPLITTER] is no kingdom then for Richard;
What other pleasu[SEQ_SPLITTER]re can the world afford?
I'll make my heaven in a [SEQ_SPLITTER]lady's lap,
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
O mis[SEQ_SPLITTER]erable thought! and more unlikely
Than to accompli[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh twenty golden crowns!
Why, love forswore me in [SEQ_SPLITTER]my mother's womb:
And, for I should not deal in he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r soft laws,
She did corrupt frail nature with som[SEQ_SPLITTER]e bribe,
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ub;
To make an envious mountain on my back,
Where [SEQ_SPLITTER]sits deformity to mock my body;
To shape my legs o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f an unequal size;
To disproportion me in every pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt,
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t carries no impression like the dam.
And am I the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n a man to be beloved?
O monstrous fault, to harbo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur such a thought!
Then, since this earth affords [SEQ_SPLITTER]no joy to me,
But to command, to cheque, to o'erbe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar such
As are of better person than myself,
I'll [SEQ_SPLITTER]make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
And, while[SEQ_SPLITTER]s I live, to account this world but hell,
Until my[SEQ_SPLITTER] mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
Be round im[SEQ_SPLITTER]paled with a glorious crown.
And yet I know not ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w to get the crown,
For many lives stand between m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e and home:
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood[SEQ_SPLITTER],
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorn[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
Seeking a way and straying from the way;
Not kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]owing how to find the open air,
But toiling desper[SEQ_SPLITTER]ately to find it out,--
Torment myself to catch th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e English crown:
And from that torment I will free[SEQ_SPLITTER] myself,
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
Why,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
And cry '[SEQ_SPLITTER]Content' to that which grieves my heart,
And wet m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y cheeks with artificial tears,
And frame my face [SEQ_SPLITTER]to all occasions.
I'll drown more sailors than the[SEQ_SPLITTER] mermaid shall;
I'll slay more gazers than the bas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ilisk;
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
Dec[SEQ_SPLITTER]eive more slily than Ulysses could,
And, like a Si[SEQ_SPLITTER]non, take another Troy.
I can add colours to the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]hameleon,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantage[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
Can [SEQ_SPLITTER]I do this, and cannot get a crown?
Tut, were it fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rther off, I'll pluck it down.
3 KING HENRY VI

KI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NG LEWIS XI:
Fair Queen of England, worthy Margare[SEQ_SPLITTER]t,
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
And b[SEQ_SPLITTER]irth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth si[SEQ_SPLITTER]t.

QUEEN MARGARET:
No, mighty King of France: now[SEQ_SPLITTER] Margaret
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to[SEQ_SPLITTER] serve
Where kings command. I was, I must confess,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
But n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow mischance hath trod my title down,
And with dis[SEQ_SPLITTER]honour laid me on the ground;
Where I must take li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke seat unto my fortune,
And to my humble seat con[SEQ_SPLITTER]form myself.

KING LEWIS XI:
Why, say, fair queen,[SEQ_SPLITTER] whence springs this deep despair?

QUEEN MARGARET[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in car[SEQ_SPLITTER]es.

KING LEWIS XI:
Whate'er it be, be thou still [SEQ_SPLITTER]like thyself,
And sit thee by our side:
Yield not [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy neck
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless [SEQ_SPLITTER]mind
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
Be [SEQ_SPLITTER]plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
It shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be eased, if France can yield relief.

QUEEN MAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]GARET:
Those gracious words revive my drooping tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ughts
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to spe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ak.
Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at Henry, sole possessor of my love,
Is of a king [SEQ_SPLITTER]become a banish'd man,
And forced to live in Scotl[SEQ_SPLITTER]and a forlorn;
While proud ambitious Edward Duke o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f York
Usurps the regal title and the seat
Of Engl[SEQ_SPLITTER]and's true-anointed lawful king.
This is the cause[SEQ_SPLITTER] that I, poor Margaret,
With this my son, Prince E[SEQ_SPLITTER]dward, Henry's heir,
Am come to crave thy just and[SEQ_SPLITTER] lawful aid;
And if thou fail us, all our hope is [SEQ_SPLITTER]done:
Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Our people and our peers are both misled,
Our tre[SEQ_SPLITTER]asures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
And, as[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.

KING LEWI[SEQ_SPLITTER]S XI:
Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm[SEQ_SPLITTER],
While we bethink a means to break it off.

QUEEN[SEQ_SPLITTER] MARGARET:
The more we stay, the stronger grows ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r foe.

KING LEWIS XI:
The more I stay, the more I[SEQ_SPLITTER]'ll succor thee.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, but impatienc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e waiteth on true sorrow.
And see where comes the [SEQ_SPLITTER]breeder of my sorrow!

KING LEWIS XI:
What's he ap[SEQ_SPLITTER]proacheth boldly to our presence?

QUEEN MARGARET:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING LEWIS XI:
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee to France?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, now begins a [SEQ_SPLITTER]second storm to rise;
For this is he that moves bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]th wind and tide.

WARWICK:
From worthy Edward, Ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng of Albion,
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed[SEQ_SPLITTER] friend,
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]irst, to do greetings to thy royal person;
And the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n to crave a league of amity;
And lastly, to confi[SEQ_SPLITTER]rm that amity
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsa[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe to grant
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sist[SEQ_SPLITTER]er,
To England's king in lawful marriage.

QUEEN M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARGARET:

WARWICK:

QUEEN MARGARET:
King Lewis and[SEQ_SPLITTER] Lady Bona, hear me speak,
Before you answer Warwi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck. His demand
Springs not from Edward's well-mean[SEQ_SPLITTER]t honest love,
But from deceit bred by necessity;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]For how can tyrants safely govern home,
Unless abr[SEQ_SPLITTER]oad they purchase great alliance?
To prove him tyr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ant this reason may suffice,
That Henry liveth sti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll: but were he dead,
Yet here Prince Edward stand[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, King Henry's son.
Look, therefore, Lewis, that [SEQ_SPLITTER]by this league and marriage
Thou draw not on thy d[SEQ_SPLITTER]anger and dishonour;
For though usurpers sway the [SEQ_SPLITTER]rule awhile,
Yet heavens are just, and time suppre[SEQ_SPLITTER]sseth wrongs.

WARWICK:
Injurious Margaret!

PRINC[SEQ_SPLITTER]E EDWARD:
And why not queen?

WARWICK:
Because thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] father Henry did usurp;
And thou no more are prin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce than she is queen.

OXFORD:
Then Warwick disann[SEQ_SPLITTER]uls great John of Gaunt,
Which did subdue the grea[SEQ_SPLITTER]test part of Spain;
And, after John of Gaunt, Henr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y the Fourth,
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wis[SEQ_SPLITTER]est;
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Who by his prowess conquered all France:
From the[SEQ_SPLITTER]se our Henry lineally descends.

WARWICK:
Oxford, [SEQ_SPLITTER]how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
You told no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t how Henry the Sixth hath lost
All that which Hen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks these peers of Franc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e should smile at that.
But for the rest, you tell[SEQ_SPLITTER] a pedigree
Of threescore and two years; a silly t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ime
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.

O[SEQ_SPLITTER]XFORD:
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy [SEQ_SPLITTER]liege,
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd not bewray thy treason with a blush?

WARWICK:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
Now buc[SEQ_SPLITTER]kler falsehood with a pedigree?
For shame! leave H[SEQ_SPLITTER]enry, and call Edward king.

OXFORD:
Call him my k[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing by whose injurious doom
My elder brother, the [SEQ_SPLITTER]Lord Aubrey Vere,
Was done to death? and more than[SEQ_SPLITTER] so, my father,
Even in the downfall of his mellow[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d years,
When nature brought him to the door of d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eath?
No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm[SEQ_SPLITTER],
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.

WARWIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]K:
And I the house of York.

KING LEWIS XI:
Queen [SEQ_SPLITTER]Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
Vouchsafe, at[SEQ_SPLITTER] our request, to stand aside,
While I use further [SEQ_SPLITTER]conference with Warwick.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Heavens [SEQ_SPLITTER]grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!

KING [SEQ_SPLITTER]LEWIS XI:
Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy cons[SEQ_SPLITTER]cience,
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.

WA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RWICK:
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING LEWIS XI:
But is he gracious in the people's [SEQ_SPLITTER]eye?

WARWICK:
The more that Henry was unfortunate[SEQ_SPLITTER].

KING LEWIS XI:
Then further, all dissembling se[SEQ_SPLITTER]t aside,
Tell me for truth the measure of his love[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Unto our sister Bona.

WARWICK:
Such it seems
As [SEQ_SPLITTER]may beseem a monarch like himself.
Myself have oft[SEQ_SPLITTER]en heard him say and swear
That this his love was [SEQ_SPLITTER]an eternal plant,
Whereof the root was fix'd in vi[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtue's ground,
The leaves and fruit maintain'd wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h beauty's sun,
Exempt from envy, but not from dis[SEQ_SPLITTER]dain,
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.

KING LE[SEQ_SPLITTER]WIS XI:
Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve[SEQ_SPLITTER].

BONA:
Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Yet I confess that often ere this day,
When I ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve heard your king's desert recounted,
Mine ear ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th tempted judgment to desire.

KING LEWIS XI:
The[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d now forthwith shall articles be drawn
Touching t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he jointure that your king must make,
Which with h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er dowry shall be counterpoised.
Draw near, Queen [SEQ_SPLITTER]Margaret, and be a witness
That Bona shall be wife[SEQ_SPLITTER] to the English king.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To Edward, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut not to the English king.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Decei[SEQ_SPLITTER]tful Warwick! it was thy device
By this alliance t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o make void my suit:
Before thy coming Lewis was H[SEQ_SPLITTER]enry's friend.

KING LEWIS XI:
And still is friend[SEQ_SPLITTER] to him and Margaret:
But if your title to the cro[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn be weak,
As may appear by Edward's good success[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Then 'tis but reason that I be released
From giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing aid which late I promised.
Yet shall you have [SEQ_SPLITTER]all kindness at my hand
That your estate requires [SEQ_SPLITTER]and mine can yield.

WARWICK:
Henry now lives in S[SEQ_SPLITTER]cotland at his ease,
Where having nothing, nothing[SEQ_SPLITTER] can he lose.
And as for you yourself, our quondam[SEQ_SPLITTER] queen,
You have a father able to maintain you;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d better 'twere you troubled him than France.

QUE[SEQ_SPLITTER]EN MARGARET:
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick[SEQ_SPLITTER], peace,
Proud setter up and puller down of kings![SEQ_SPLITTER]
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]oth full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
Thy sl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y conveyance and thy lord's false love;
For both o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f you are birds of selfsame feather.

KING LEWIS X[SEQ_SPLITTER]I:
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.

Post[SEQ_SPLITTER]:

OXFORD:
I like it well that our fair queen and [SEQ_SPLITTER]mistress
Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns [SEQ_SPLITTER]at his.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, mark how Lewis stamps[SEQ_SPLITTER], as he were nettled:
I hope all's for the best.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, what are thy news? and you[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs, fair queen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mine, such as fil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l my heart with unhoped joys.

WARWICK:
Mine, full[SEQ_SPLITTER] of sorrow and heart's discontent.

KING LEWIS XI:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
And no[SEQ_SPLITTER]w, to soothe your forgery and his,
Sends me a pape[SEQ_SPLITTER]r to persuade me patience?
Is this the alliance th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at he seeks with France?
Dare he presume to scorn [SEQ_SPLITTER]us in this manner?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I told your ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]jesty as much before:
This proveth Edward's love a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd Warwick's honesty.

WARWICK:
King Lewis, I here[SEQ_SPLITTER] protest, in sight of heaven,
And by the hope I ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve of heavenly bliss,
That I am clear from this mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sdeed of Edward's,
No more my king, for he dishono[SEQ_SPLITTER]urs me,
But most himself, if he could see his sham[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.
Did I forget that by the house of York
My fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r came untimely to his death?
Did I let pass the a[SEQ_SPLITTER]buse done to my niece?
Did I impale him with the r[SEQ_SPLITTER]egal crown?
Did I put Henry from his native right?[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
Shame [SEQ_SPLITTER]on himself! for my desert is honour:
And to repair[SEQ_SPLITTER] my honour lost for him,
I here renounce him and r[SEQ_SPLITTER]eturn to Henry.
My noble queen, let former grudges[SEQ_SPLITTER] pass,
And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
I wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
And replant Hen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry in his former state.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, [SEQ_SPLITTER]these words have turn'd my hate to love;
And I for[SEQ_SPLITTER]give and quite forget old faults,
And joy that tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u becomest King Henry's friend.

WARWICK:
So much [SEQ_SPLITTER]his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
That, if Kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
With some few band[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of chosen soldiers,
I'll undertake to land them [SEQ_SPLITTER]on our coast
And force the tyrant from his seat by[SEQ_SPLITTER] war.
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
He's[SEQ_SPLITTER] very likely now to fall from him,
For matching mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re for wanton lust than honour,
Or than for streng[SEQ_SPLITTER]th and safety of our country.

BONA:
Dear brother,[SEQ_SPLITTER] how shall Bona be revenged
But by thy help to thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s distressed queen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Renowned prin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce, how shall poor Henry live,
Unless thou rescue [SEQ_SPLITTER]him from foul despair?

BONA:
My quarrel and this [SEQ_SPLITTER]English queen's are one.

WARWICK:
And mine, fair [SEQ_SPLITTER]lady Bona, joins with yours.

KING LEWIS XI:
And m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
Therefor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e at last I firmly am resolved
You shall have aid.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

QUEEN MARGARET:
Let me give humble thanks for al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l at once.

KING LEWIS XI:
Then, England's messeng[SEQ_SPLITTER]er, return in post,
And tell false Edward, thy sup[SEQ_SPLITTER]posed king,
That Lewis of France is sending over m[SEQ_SPLITTER]asquers
To revel it with him and his new bride:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.

BO[SEQ_SPLITTER]NA:
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y,
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.

QUE[SEQ_SPLITTER]EN MARGARET:
Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid [SEQ_SPLITTER]aside,
And I am ready to put armour on.

WARWICK:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
And t[SEQ_SPLITTER]herefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
There's t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy reward: be gone.

KING LEWIS XI:
But, Warwick,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
Shall cro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss the seas, and bid false Edward battle;
And, as [SEQ_SPLITTER]occasion serves, this noble queen
And prince shall[SEQ_SPLITTER] follow with a fresh supply.
Yet, ere thou go, but[SEQ_SPLITTER] answer me one doubt,
What pledge have we of thy f[SEQ_SPLITTER]irm loyalty?

WARWICK:
This shall assure my consta[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt loyalty,
That if our queen and this young princ[SEQ_SPLITTER]e agree,
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.

QUEEN MA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RGARET:
Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
Therefore[SEQ_SPLITTER] delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
And, with th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y hand, thy faith irrevocable,
That only Warwick's[SEQ_SPLITTER] daughter shall be thine.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Yes, I a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ccept her, for she well deserves it;
And here, to [SEQ_SPLITTER]pledge my vow, I give my hand.

KING LEWIS XI:
Why[SEQ_SPLITTER] stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
Shalt waft t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hem over with our royal fleet.
I long till Edward [SEQ_SPLITTER]fall by war's mischance,
For mocking marriage with[SEQ_SPLITTER] a dame of France.

WARWICK:
I came from Edward as[SEQ_SPLITTER] ambassador,
But I return his sworn and mortal foe[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t dreadful war shall answer his demand.
Had he non[SEQ_SPLITTER]e else to make a stale but me?
Then none but I sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll turn his jest to sorrow.
I was the chief that r[SEQ_SPLITTER]aised him to the crown,
And I'll be chief to bring[SEQ_SPLITTER] him down again:
Not that I pity Henry's misery,
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
3 KING HENRY [SEQ_SPLITTER]VI

GLOUCESTER:
Now tell me, brother Clarence, wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t think you
Of this new marriage with the Lady Gre[SEQ_SPLITTER]y?
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?

CLA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RENCE:
Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to Fran[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce;
How could he stay till Warwick made return?

S[SEQ_SPLITTER]OMERSET:
My lords, forbear this talk; here comes t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he king.

GLOUCESTER:
And his well-chosen bride.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]CLARENCE:
I mind to tell him plainly what I think.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother of Clarence, how li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke you our choice,
That you stand pensive, as half[SEQ_SPLITTER] malcontent?

CLARENCE:
As well as Lewis of France[SEQ_SPLITTER], or the Earl of Warwick,
Which are so weak of cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rage and in judgment
That they'll take no offence [SEQ_SPLITTER]at our abuse.

KING EDWARD IV:
Suppose they take o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ffence without a cause,
They are but Lewis and War[SEQ_SPLITTER]wick: I am Edward,
Your king and Warwick's, and mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]st have my will.

GLOUCESTER:
And shall have your [SEQ_SPLITTER]will, because our king:
Yet hasty marriage seldom [SEQ_SPLITTER]proveth well.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother Richar[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, are you offended too?

GLOUCESTER:
Not I:
No, G[SEQ_SPLITTER]od forbid that I should wish them sever'd
Whom God[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity
To sund[SEQ_SPLITTER]er them that yoke so well together.

KING EDWARD I[SEQ_SPLITTER]V:
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
Tel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l me some reason why the Lady Grey
Should not beco[SEQ_SPLITTER]me my wife and England's queen.
And you too, Somer[SEQ_SPLITTER]set and Montague,
Speak freely what you think.

CL[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARENCE:
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Becomes your enemy, for mocking him
About the mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]riage of the Lady Bona.

GLOUCESTER:
And Warwick, [SEQ_SPLITTER]doing what you gave in charge,
Is now dishonoured [SEQ_SPLITTER]by this new marriage.

KING EDWARD IV:
What if bot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h Lewis and Warwick be appeased
By such invention [SEQ_SPLITTER]as I can devise?

MONTAGUE:
Yet, to have join'd wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th France in such alliance
Would more have strengt[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen'd this our commonwealth
'Gainst foreign storms[SEQ_SPLITTER] than any home-bred marriage.

HASTINGS:
Why, know[SEQ_SPLITTER]s not Montague that of itself
England is safe, if [SEQ_SPLITTER]true within itself?

MONTAGUE:
But the safer when [SEQ_SPLITTER]'tis back'd with France.

HASTINGS:
'Tis better us[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing France than trusting France:
Let us be back'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]with God and with the seas
Which He hath given for[SEQ_SPLITTER] fence impregnable,
And with their helps only defe[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd ourselves;
In them and in ourselves our safety [SEQ_SPLITTER]lies.

CLARENCE:
For this one speech Lord Hastings[SEQ_SPLITTER] well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hunger[SEQ_SPLITTER]ford.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, what of that? it was my[SEQ_SPLITTER] will and grant;
And for this once my will shall s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tand for law.

GLOUCESTER:
And yet methinks your g[SEQ_SPLITTER]race hath not done well,
To give the heir and daug[SEQ_SPLITTER]hter of Lord Scales
Unto the brother of your lovin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g bride;
She better would have fitted me or Claren[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce:
But in your bride you bury brotherhood.

CLARE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NCE:
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
And l[SEQ_SPLITTER]eave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.

KING ED[SEQ_SPLITTER]WARD IV:
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.

CLARE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NCE:
In choosing for yourself, you show'd your jud[SEQ_SPLITTER]gment,
Which being shallow, you give me leave
To p[SEQ_SPLITTER]lay the broker in mine own behalf;
And to that end[SEQ_SPLITTER] I shortly mind to leave you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Lea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
And not be t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ied unto his brother's will.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My [SEQ_SPLITTER]lords, before it pleased his majesty
To raise my s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tate to title of a queen,
Do me but right, and you[SEQ_SPLITTER] must all confess
That I was not ignoble of descen[SEQ_SPLITTER]t;
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut as this title honours me and mine,
So your disl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ike, to whom I would be pleasing,
Doth cloud my jo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ys with danger and with sorrow.

KING EDWARD IV:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]y love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
What da[SEQ_SPLITTER]nger or what sorrow can befall thee,
So long as Ed[SEQ_SPLITTER]ward is thy constant friend,
And their true sovere[SEQ_SPLITTER]ign, whom they must obey?
Nay, whom they shall obe[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, and love thee too,
Unless they seek for hatred [SEQ_SPLITTER]at my hands;
Which if they do, yet will I keep the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e safe,
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, messenger,[SEQ_SPLITTER] what letters or what news
From France?

Post:
My [SEQ_SPLITTER]sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,
But su[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch as I, without your special pardon,
Dare not rel[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go to, we pardon thee: there[SEQ_SPLITTER]fore, in brief,
Tell me their words as near as tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u canst guess them.
What answer makes King Lewis u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nto our letters?

Post:
At my depart, these were h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is very words:
'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed[SEQ_SPLITTER] king,
That Lewis of France is sending over masque[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs
To revel it with him and his new bride.'

KING [SEQ_SPLITTER]EDWARD IV:
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me [SEQ_SPLITTER]Henry.
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?

Po[SEQ_SPLITTER]st:
These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly[SEQ_SPLITTER],
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'

KIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]G EDWARD IV:
I blame not her, she could say little[SEQ_SPLITTER] less;
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's qu[SEQ_SPLITTER]een?
For I have heard that she was there in place.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Post:
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds [SEQ_SPLITTER]are done,
And I am ready to put armour on.'

KING [SEQ_SPLITTER]EDWARD IV:
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t what said Warwick to these injuries?

Post:
He, [SEQ_SPLITTER]more incensed against your majesty
Than all the re[SEQ_SPLITTER]st, discharged me with these words:
'Tell him from[SEQ_SPLITTER] me that he hath done me wrong,
And therefore I'll[SEQ_SPLITTER] uncrown him ere't be long.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Ha! [SEQ_SPLITTER]durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
Well[SEQ_SPLITTER] I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:
They shall [SEQ_SPLITTER]have wars and pay for their presumption.
But say, [SEQ_SPLITTER]is Warwick friends with Margaret?

Post:
Ay, graci[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous sovereign; they are so link'd in
friendship
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

CLARENCE:
Belike the elder; Clarence will have t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he younger.
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou fast,
For I will hence to Warwick's other daugh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter;
That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriag[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
I may not prove inferior to yourself.
You that l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove me and Warwick, follow me.

GLOUCESTER:

KING [SEQ_SPLITTER]EDWARD IV:
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ick!
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And haste is needful in this desperate case.
Pembr[SEQ_SPLITTER]oke and Stafford, you in our behalf
Go levy men, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd make prepare for war;
They are already, or quic[SEQ_SPLITTER]kly will be landed:
Myself in person will straight[SEQ_SPLITTER] follow you.
But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
Are[SEQ_SPLITTER] near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
Tell me[SEQ_SPLITTER] if you love Warwick more than me?
If it be so, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]en both depart to him;
I rather wish you foes than[SEQ_SPLITTER] hollow friends:
But if you mind to hold your true[SEQ_SPLITTER] obedience,
Give me assurance with some friendly v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow,
That I may never have you in suspect.

MONTAGU[SEQ_SPLITTER]E:
So God help Montague as he proves true!

HASTIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]GS:
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!

KI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NG EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, will you stand[SEQ_SPLITTER] by us?

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, in despite of all that sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all withstand you.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so! then [SEQ_SPLITTER]am I sure of victory.
Now therefore let us hence; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and lose no hour,
Till we meet Warwick with his fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]reign power.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Trust me, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y lord, all hitherto goes well;
The common people [SEQ_SPLITTER]by numbers swarm to us.
But see where Somerset and[SEQ_SPLITTER] Clarence come!
Speak suddenly, my lords, are we a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll friends?

CLARENCE:
Fear not that, my lord.

WA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RWICK:
Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick[SEQ_SPLITTER];
And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice
To re[SEQ_SPLITTER]st mistrustful where a noble heart
Hath pawn'd an [SEQ_SPLITTER]open hand in sign of love;
Else might I think that[SEQ_SPLITTER] Clarence, Edward's brother,
Were but a feigned fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iend to our proceedings:
But welcome, sweet Claren[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce; my daughter shall be thine.
And now what rests[SEQ_SPLITTER] but, in night's coverture,
Thy brother being care[SEQ_SPLITTER]lessly encamp'd,
His soldiers lurking in the towns[SEQ_SPLITTER] about,
And but attended by a simple guard,
We may[SEQ_SPLITTER] surprise and take him at our pleasure?
Our scouts[SEQ_SPLITTER] have found the adventure very easy:
That as Ulyss[SEQ_SPLITTER]es and stout Diomede
With sleight and manhood stol[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to Rhesus' tents,
And brought from thence the Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]racian fatal steeds,
So we, well cover'd with the [SEQ_SPLITTER]night's black mantle,
At unawares may beat down Ed[SEQ_SPLITTER]ward's guard
And seize himself; I say not, slaught[SEQ_SPLITTER]er him,
For I intend but only to surprise him.
You[SEQ_SPLITTER] that will follow me to this attempt,
Applaud the [SEQ_SPLITTER]name of Henry with your leader.
Why, then, let's o[SEQ_SPLITTER]n our way in silent sort:
For Warwick and his frie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds, God and Saint George!
3 KING HENRY VI

First [SEQ_SPLITTER]Watchman:
Come on, my masters, each man take his s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tand:
The king by this is set him down to sleep.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Second Watchman:
What, will he not to bed?

First [SEQ_SPLITTER]Watchman:
Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]ever to lie and take his natural rest
Till Warwick[SEQ_SPLITTER] or himself be quite suppress'd.

Second Watchman:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To-morrow then belike shall be the day,
If Warwic[SEQ_SPLITTER]k be so near as men report.

Third Watchman:
But s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, I pray, what nobleman is that
That with the ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng here resteth in his tent?

First Watchman:
'Tis[SEQ_SPLITTER] the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.

T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hird Watchman:
O, is it so? But why commands the k[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing
That his chief followers lodge in towns about [SEQ_SPLITTER]him,
While he himself keeps in the cold field?

Se[SEQ_SPLITTER]cond Watchman:
'Tis the more honour, because more [SEQ_SPLITTER]dangerous.

Third Watchman:
Ay, but give me worshi[SEQ_SPLITTER]p and quietness;
I like it better than a dangerous[SEQ_SPLITTER] honour.
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.

First Wat[SEQ_SPLITTER]chman:
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage[SEQ_SPLITTER].

Second Watchman:
Ay, wherefore else guard we hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s royal tent,
But to defend his person from night-[SEQ_SPLITTER]foes?

WARWICK:
This is his tent; and see where st[SEQ_SPLITTER]and his guard.
Courage, my masters! honour now or [SEQ_SPLITTER]never!
But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.

F[SEQ_SPLITTER]irst Watchman:
Who goes there?

Second Watchman:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]tay, or thou diest!

SOMERSET:
What are they that [SEQ_SPLITTER]fly there?

WARWICK:
Richard and Hastings: let the[SEQ_SPLITTER]m go; here is The duke.

KING EDWARD IV:
The duke![SEQ_SPLITTER] Why, Warwick, when we parted,
Thou call'dst me ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng.

WARWICK:
Ay, but the case is alter'd:
When yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u disgraced me in my embassade,
Then I degraded yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u from being king,
And come now to create you Duke[SEQ_SPLITTER] of York.
Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That know not how to use ambassadors,
Nor how to [SEQ_SPLITTER]be contented with one wife,
Nor how to use your br[SEQ_SPLITTER]others brotherly,
Nor how to study for the people'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s welfare,
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, brother of Clarence, are t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou here too?
Nay, then I see that Edward needs mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]st down.
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
Edward wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll always bear himself as king:
Though fortune's m[SEQ_SPLITTER]alice overthrow my state,
My mind exceeds the comp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ass of her wheel.

WARWICK:
Then, for his mind, be[SEQ_SPLITTER] Edward England's king:
But Henry now shall wear t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he English crown,
And be true king indeed, thou bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the shadow.
My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
Unto my[SEQ_SPLITTER] brother, Archbishop of York.
When I have fought w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith Pembroke and his fellows,
I'll follow you, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] tell what answer
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to [SEQ_SPLITTER]him.
Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KING EDWARD IV:
What fates impose, that men must[SEQ_SPLITTER] needs abide;
It boots not to resist both wind and[SEQ_SPLITTER] tide.

OXFORD:
What now remains, my lords, for us[SEQ_SPLITTER] to do
But march to London with our soldiers?

WAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]WICK:
Ay, that's the first thing that we have to d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o;
To free King Henry from imprisonment
And see hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m seated in the regal throne.
3 KING HENRY VI

RIV[SEQ_SPLITTER]ERS:
Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why brother Rivers, are you yet [SEQ_SPLITTER]to learn
What late misfortune is befall'n King Edw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard?

RIVERS:
What! loss of some pitch'd battle ag[SEQ_SPLITTER]ainst Warwick?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, but the loss [SEQ_SPLITTER]of his own royal person.

RIVERS:
Then is my sover[SEQ_SPLITTER]eign slain?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay, almost slain, fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r he is taken prisoner,
Either betray'd by falseho[SEQ_SPLITTER]od of his guard
Or by his foe surprised at unaware[SEQ_SPLITTER]s:
And, as I further have to understand,
Is new co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mmitted to the Bishop of York,
Fell Warwick's brot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her and by that our foe.

RIVERS:
These news I mus[SEQ_SPLITTER]t confess are full of grief;
Yet, gracious madam, [SEQ_SPLITTER]bear it as you may:
Warwick may lose, that now hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h won the day.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Till then fair ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]pe must hinder life's decay.
And I the rather wean[SEQ_SPLITTER] me from despair
For love of Edward's offspring in[SEQ_SPLITTER] my womb:
This is it that makes me bridle passion
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;
Ay, [SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, for this I draw in many a tear
And stop the ri[SEQ_SPLITTER]sing of blood-sucking sighs,
Lest with my sighs or[SEQ_SPLITTER] tears I blast or drown
King Edward's fruit, true [SEQ_SPLITTER]heir to the English crown.

RIVERS:
But, madam, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere is Warwick then become?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I am[SEQ_SPLITTER] inform'd that he comes towards London,
To set the[SEQ_SPLITTER] crown once more on Henry's head:
Guess thou the r[SEQ_SPLITTER]est; King Edward's friends must down,
But, to prev[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent the tyrant's violence,--
For trust not him tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t hath once broken faith,--
I'll hence forthwith u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nto the sanctuary,
To save at least the heir of Ed[SEQ_SPLITTER]ward's right:
There shall I rest secure from force[SEQ_SPLITTER] and fraud.
Come, therefore, let us fly while we m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay fly:
If Warwick take us we are sure to die.
3 K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Now, my Lord Hastings an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d Sir William Stanley,
Leave off to wonder why I d[SEQ_SPLITTER]rew you hither,
Into this chiefest thicket of the [SEQ_SPLITTER]park.
Thus stands the case: you know our king, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]brother,
Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose [SEQ_SPLITTER]hands
He hath good usage and great liberty,
And, o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ften but attended with weak guard,
Comes hunting t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his way to disport himself.
I have advertised him [SEQ_SPLITTER]by secret means
That if about this hour he make hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s way
Under the colour of his usual game,
He shall[SEQ_SPLITTER] here find his friends with horse and men
To set h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im free from his captivity.

Huntsman:
This way, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y lord; for this way lies the game.

KING EDWARD I[SEQ_SPLITTER]V:
Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stan[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]the rest,
Stand you thus close, to steal the bisho[SEQ_SPLITTER]p's deer?

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, the time and case [SEQ_SPLITTER]requireth haste:
Your horse stands ready at the pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rk-corner.

KING EDWARD IV:
But whither shall we t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen?

HASTINGS:
To Lynn, my lord,
And ship from th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ence to Flanders.

GLOUCESTER:
Well guess'd, belie[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve me; for that was my meaning.

KING EDWARD IV:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]tanley, I will requite thy forwardness.

GLOUCESTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]R:
But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING EDWARD IV:
Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou go along?

Huntsman:
Better do so than tarry an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d be hang'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Come then, away; let's h[SEQ_SPLITTER]a' no more ado.

KING EDWARD IV:
Bishop, farewell:[SEQ_SPLITTER] shield thee from Warwick's frown;
And pray that I[SEQ_SPLITTER] may repossess the crown.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING HE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NRY VI:
Master lieutenant, now that God and friend[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
And turn[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d my captive state to liberty,
My fear to hope, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y sorrows unto joys,
At our enlargement what are t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy due fees?

Lieutenant:
Subjects may challenge n[SEQ_SPLITTER]othing of their sovereigns;
But if an humble praye[SEQ_SPLITTER]r may prevail,
I then crave pardon of your majesty[SEQ_SPLITTER].

KING HENRY VI:
For what, lieutenant? for well u[SEQ_SPLITTER]sing me?
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy k[SEQ_SPLITTER]indness,
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasu[SEQ_SPLITTER]re;
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
Conceive [SEQ_SPLITTER]when after many moody thoughts
At last by notes of[SEQ_SPLITTER] household harmony
They quite forget their loss of[SEQ_SPLITTER] liberty.
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me [SEQ_SPLITTER]free,
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]He was the author, thou the instrument.
Therefore,[SEQ_SPLITTER] that I may conquer fortune's spite
By living low,[SEQ_SPLITTER] where fortune cannot hurt me,
And that the people[SEQ_SPLITTER] of this blessed land
May not be punish'd with my [SEQ_SPLITTER]thwarting stars,
Warwick, although my head still w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ear the crown,
I here resign my government to thee[SEQ_SPLITTER],
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.

WARWIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]K:
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
By spying an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d avoiding fortune's malice,
For few men rightly t[SEQ_SPLITTER]emper with the stars:
Yet in this one thing let me[SEQ_SPLITTER] blame your grace,
For choosing me when Clarence i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s in place.

CLARENCE:
No, Warwick, thou art worth[SEQ_SPLITTER]y of the sway,
To whom the heavens in thy nativity[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
As lik[SEQ_SPLITTER]ely to be blest in peace and war;
And therefore I [SEQ_SPLITTER]yield thee my free consent.

WARWICK:
And I choose[SEQ_SPLITTER] Clarence only for protector.

KING HENRY VI:
Warw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ick and Clarence give me both your hands:
Now join[SEQ_SPLITTER] your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] no dissension hinder government:
I make you both [SEQ_SPLITTER]protectors of this land,
While I myself will lead [SEQ_SPLITTER]a private life
And in devotion spend my latter day[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.

WARWI[SEQ_SPLITTER]CK:
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

CLARENCE:
That he consents, if Warwick yield con[SEQ_SPLITTER]sent;
For on thy fortune I repose myself.

WARWICK[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
To Henry[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s body, and supply his place;
I mean, in bearing [SEQ_SPLITTER]weight of government,
While he enjoys the honour a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd his ease.
And, Clarence, now then it is more th[SEQ_SPLITTER]an needful
Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a t[SEQ_SPLITTER]raitor,
And all his lands and goods be confiscate.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

CLARENCE:
What else? and that succession be dete[SEQ_SPLITTER]rmined.

WARWICK:
Ay, therein Clarence shall not w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ant his part.

KING HENRY VI:
But, with the first [SEQ_SPLITTER]of all your chief affairs,
Let me entreat, for I c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ommand no more,
That Margaret your queen and my so[SEQ_SPLITTER]n Edward
Be sent for, to return from France with s[SEQ_SPLITTER]peed;
For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
[SEQ_SPLITTER]My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.

CLARENCE:
It [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.

KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] HENRY VI:
My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Of whom you seem to have so tender care?

SOMERS[SEQ_SPLITTER]ET:
My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KING HENRY VI:
Come hither, England's hope.
If s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ecret powers
Suggest but truth to my divining thou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghts,
This pretty lad will prove our country's bli[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss.
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
His he[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad by nature framed to wear a crown,
His hand to w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ield a sceptre, and himself
Likely in time to bles[SEQ_SPLITTER]s a regal throne.
Make much of him, my lords, for [SEQ_SPLITTER]this is he
Must help you more than you are hurt by[SEQ_SPLITTER] me.

WARWICK:
What news, my friend?

Post:
That E[SEQ_SPLITTER]dward is escaped from your brother,
And fled, as h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hears since, to Burgundy.

WARWICK:
Unsavoury ne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ws! but how made he escape?

Post:
He was convey'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] by Richard Duke of Gloucester
And the Lord Hastin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gs, who attended him
In secret ambush on the fores[SEQ_SPLITTER]t side
And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
For hunting was his daily exercise.

WARWICK:
My [SEQ_SPLITTER]brother was too careless of his charge.
But let us[SEQ_SPLITTER] hence, my sovereign, to provide
A salve for any s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore that may betide.

SOMERSET:
My lord, I like no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of this flight of Edward's;
For doubtless Burgun[SEQ_SPLITTER]dy will yield him help,
And we shall have more war[SEQ_SPLITTER]s before 't be long.
As Henry's late presaging pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]phecy
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Ri[SEQ_SPLITTER]chmond,
So doth my heart misgive me, in these conf[SEQ_SPLITTER]licts
What may befall him, to his harm and ours:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]herefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
Forth[SEQ_SPLITTER]with we'll send him hence to Brittany,
Till storms[SEQ_SPLITTER] be past of civil enmity.

OXFORD:
Ay, for if Edwa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd repossess the crown,
'Tis like that Richmond wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th the rest shall down.

SOMERSET:
It shall be so;[SEQ_SPLITTER] he shall to Brittany.
Come, therefore, let's abou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t it speedily.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
No[SEQ_SPLITTER]w, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]et thus far fortune maketh us amends,
And says tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t once more I shall interchange
My waned state for[SEQ_SPLITTER] Henry's regal crown.
Well have we pass'd and now [SEQ_SPLITTER]repass'd the seas
And brought desired help from Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rgundy:
What then remains, we being thus arrived
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t that we enter, as into our dukedom?

GLOUCESTER:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
Fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r many men that stumble at the threshold
Are well [SEQ_SPLITTER]foretold that danger lurks within.

KING EDWARD IV[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]By fair or foul means we must enter in,
For hither[SEQ_SPLITTER] will our friends repair to us.

HASTINGS:
My lieg[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, I'll knock once more to summon them.

Mayor:
My[SEQ_SPLITTER] lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
And shu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the gates for safety of ourselves;
For now we ow[SEQ_SPLITTER]e allegiance unto Henry.

KING EDWARD IV:
But, mas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter mayor, if Henry be your king,
Yet Edward at th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e least is Duke of York.

Mayor:
True, my good lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d; I know you for no less.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
As being we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll content with that alone.

GLOUCESTER:

HASTINGS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Ope[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the gates; we are King Henry's friends.

Mayor:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]LOUCESTER:
A wise stout captain, and soon persuade[SEQ_SPLITTER]d!

HASTINGS:
The good old man would fain that all[SEQ_SPLITTER] were well,
So 'twere not 'long of him; but being [SEQ_SPLITTER]enter'd,
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.

KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] EDWARD IV:
So, master mayor: these gates must not[SEQ_SPLITTER] be shut
But in the night or in the time of war.
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
For [SEQ_SPLITTER]Edward will defend the town and thee,
And all thos[SEQ_SPLITTER]e friends that deign to follow me.

GLOUCESTER:
Br[SEQ_SPLITTER]other, this is Sir John Montgomery,
Our trusty fri[SEQ_SPLITTER]end, unless I be deceived.

KING EDWARD IV:
Welcom[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, Sir John! But why come you in arms?

MONTAGUE:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To help King Edward in his time of storm,
As every[SEQ_SPLITTER] loyal subject ought to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thank[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, good Montgomery; but we now forget
Our title to[SEQ_SPLITTER] the crown and only claim
Our dukedom till God ple[SEQ_SPLITTER]ase to send the rest.

MONTAGUE:
Then fare you wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l, for I will hence again:
I came to serve a king [SEQ_SPLITTER]and not a duke.
Drummer, strike up, and let us mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch away.

KING EDWARD IV:
Nay, stay, Sir John, awh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ile, and we'll debate
By what safe means the crown[SEQ_SPLITTER] may be recover'd.

MONTAGUE:
What talk you of deb[SEQ_SPLITTER]ating? in few words,
If you'll not here proclaim y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ourself our king,
I'll leave you to your fortune a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd be gone
To keep them back that come to succor y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou:
Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]GLOUCESTER:
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice points?

KING EDWARD IV:
When we grow stronger[SEQ_SPLITTER], then we'll make our claim:
Till then, 'tis wisdo[SEQ_SPLITTER]m to conceal our meaning.

HASTINGS:
Away with scr[SEQ_SPLITTER]upulous wit! now arms must rule.

GLOUCESTER:
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother,[SEQ_SPLITTER] we will proclaim you out of hand:
The bruit there[SEQ_SPLITTER]of will bring you many friends.

KING EDWARD IV:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
And Henr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y but usurps the diadem.

MONTAGUE:
Ay, now my sov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ereign speaketh like himself;
And now will I be Ed[SEQ_SPLITTER]ward's champion.

HASTINGS:
Sound trumpet; Edward [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall be here proclaim'd:
Come, fellow-soldier, ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke thou proclamation.

Soldier:
Edward the Fourth,[SEQ_SPLITTER] by the grace of God, king of
England and France, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and lord of Ireland, &c.

MONTAGUE:
And whosoe'er [SEQ_SPLITTER]gainsays King Edward's right,
By this I challenge [SEQ_SPLITTER]him to single fight.

All:
Long live Edward the Fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]urth!

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, brave Montgomery; a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd thanks unto you all:
If fortune serve me, I'll [SEQ_SPLITTER]requite this kindness.
Now, for this night, let's [SEQ_SPLITTER]harbour here in York;
And when the morning sun sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll raise his car
Above the border of this horizon,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
For [SEQ_SPLITTER]well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
Ah, froward C[SEQ_SPLITTER]larence! how evil it beseems thee
To flatter Henry[SEQ_SPLITTER] and forsake thy brother!
Yet, as we may, we'll me[SEQ_SPLITTER]et both thee and Warwick.
Come on, brave soldiers:[SEQ_SPLITTER] doubt not of the day,
And, that once gotten, doub[SEQ_SPLITTER]t not of large pay.
3 KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
What[SEQ_SPLITTER] counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
With hasty Ge[SEQ_SPLITTER]rmans and blunt Hollanders,
Hath pass'd in safety [SEQ_SPLITTER]through the narrow seas,
And with his troops doth [SEQ_SPLITTER]march amain to London;
And many giddy people flock[SEQ_SPLITTER] to him.

KING HENRY VI:
Let's levy men, and beat [SEQ_SPLITTER]him back again.

CLARENCE:
A little fire is quickl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y trodden out;
Which, being suffer'd, rivers canno[SEQ_SPLITTER]t quench.

WARWICK:
In Warwickshire I have true-he[SEQ_SPLITTER]arted friends,
Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in [SEQ_SPLITTER]war;
Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarenc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:
Thou[SEQ_SPLITTER], brother Montague, in Buckingham,
Northampton and[SEQ_SPLITTER] in Leicestershire, shalt find
Men well inclined t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o hear what thou command'st:
And thou, brave Oxfor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, wondrous well beloved,
In Oxfordshire shalt mus[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter up thy friends.
My sovereign, with the loving [SEQ_SPLITTER]citizens,
Like to his island girt in with the ocea[SEQ_SPLITTER]n,
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
Shall r[SEQ_SPLITTER]est in London till we come to him.
Fair lords, tak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e leave and stand not to reply.
Farewell, my sover[SEQ_SPLITTER]eign.

KING HENRY VI:
Farewell, my Hector, and my [SEQ_SPLITTER]Troy's true hope.

CLARENCE:
In sign of truth, I k[SEQ_SPLITTER]iss your highness' hand.

KING HENRY VI:
Well-mind[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed Clarence, be thou fortunate!

MONTAGUE:
Comfort[SEQ_SPLITTER], my lord; and so I take my leave.

OXFORD:
And th[SEQ_SPLITTER]us I seal my truth, and bid adieu.

KING HENRY VI:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
And all at [SEQ_SPLITTER]once, once more a happy farewell.

WARWICK:
Farewe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.

KING HEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]RY VI:
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
Cous[SEQ_SPLITTER]in of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
Methinks [SEQ_SPLITTER]the power that Edward hath in field
Should not be [SEQ_SPLITTER]able to encounter mine.

EXETER:
The doubt is that[SEQ_SPLITTER] he will seduce the rest.

KING HENRY VI:
That's n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
I have not s[SEQ_SPLITTER]topp'd mine ears to their demands,
Nor posted off [SEQ_SPLITTER]their suits with slow delays;
My pity hath been ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]lm to heal their wounds,
My mildness hath allay'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]their swelling griefs,
My mercy dried their water-[SEQ_SPLITTER]flowing tears;
I have not been desirous of their w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ealth,
Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidie[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.
Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Then why should they love Edward more than me?
No[SEQ_SPLITTER], Exeter, these graces challenge grace:
And when t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he lion fawns upon the lamb,
The lamb will never c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ease to follow him.

EXETER:
Hark, hark, my lord! [SEQ_SPLITTER]what shouts are these?

KING EDWARD IV:
Seize on t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;
And once aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]in proclaim us King of England.
You are the fount [SEQ_SPLITTER]that makes small brooks to flow:
Now stops thy spr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
And swell so much[SEQ_SPLITTER] the higher by their ebb.
Hence with him to the To[SEQ_SPLITTER]wer; let him not speak.
And, lords, towards Covent[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry bend we our course
Where peremptory Warwick now[SEQ_SPLITTER] remains:
The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.

GLOU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CESTER:
Away betimes, before his forces join,
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]take the great-grown traitor unawares:
Brave warri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ors, march amain towards Coventry.
3 KING HENRY VI[SEQ_SPLITTER]

WARWICK:
Where is the post that came from valian[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Oxford?
How far hence is thy lord, mine honest f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ellow?

First Messenger:
By this at Dunsmore, marc[SEQ_SPLITTER]hing hitherward.

WARWICK:
How far off is our brot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her Montague?
Where is the post that came from Mon[SEQ_SPLITTER]tague?

Second Messenger:
By this at Daintry, with[SEQ_SPLITTER] a puissant troop.

WARWICK:
Say, Somerville, what[SEQ_SPLITTER] says my loving son?
And, by thy guess, how nigh i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s Clarence now?

SOMERSET:
At Southam I did leave [SEQ_SPLITTER]him with his forces,
And do expect him here some t[SEQ_SPLITTER]wo hours hence.

WARWICK:
Then Clarence is at hand[SEQ_SPLITTER], I hear his drum.

SOMERSET:
It is not his, my lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd; here Southam lies:
The drum your honour hears [SEQ_SPLITTER]marcheth from Warwick.

WARWICK:
Who should that b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e? belike, unlook'd-for friends.

SOMERSET:
They a[SEQ_SPLITTER]re at hand, and you shall quickly know.

KING EDWA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RD IV:
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

GLOUCESTER:
See how the surly Warwick mans the[SEQ_SPLITTER] wall!

WARWICK:
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward[SEQ_SPLITTER] come?
Where slept our scouts, or how are they sed[SEQ_SPLITTER]uced,
That we could hear no news of his repair?

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING EDWARD IV:
Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the cit[SEQ_SPLITTER]y gates,
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee,
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd he shall pardon thee these outrages.

WARWICK:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
Conf[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
Call War[SEQ_SPLITTER]wick patron and be penitent?
And thou shalt still [SEQ_SPLITTER]remain the Duke of York.

GLOUCESTER:
I thought, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t least, he would have said the king;
Or did he ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke the jest against his will?

WARWICK:
Is not a d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ukedom, sir, a goodly gift?

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, by my[SEQ_SPLITTER] faith, for a poor earl to give:
I'll do thee serv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice for so good a gift.

WARWICK:
'Twas I that gav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e the kingdom to thy brother.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why[SEQ_SPLITTER] then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.

WARWIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]K:
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
And we[SEQ_SPLITTER]akling, Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry is[SEQ_SPLITTER] my king, Warwick his subject.

KING EDWARD IV:
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
And, gallan[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Warwick, do but answer this:
What is the body wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]en the head is off?

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, that Warwic[SEQ_SPLITTER]k had no more forecast,
But, whiles he thought to [SEQ_SPLITTER]steal the single ten,
The king was slily finger'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]from the deck!
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's[SEQ_SPLITTER] palace,
And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the T[SEQ_SPLITTER]ower.

EDWARD:
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick s[SEQ_SPLITTER]till.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, Warwick, take the time; k[SEQ_SPLITTER]neel down, kneel down:
Nay, when? strike now, or e[SEQ_SPLITTER]lse the iron cools.

WARWICK:
I had rather chop th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is hand off at a blow,
And with the other fling it[SEQ_SPLITTER] at thy face,
Than bear so low a sail, to strike t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o thee.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sail how thou canst, have[SEQ_SPLITTER] wind and tide thy friend,
This hand, fast wound a[SEQ_SPLITTER]bout thy coal-black hair
Shall, whiles thy head is[SEQ_SPLITTER] warm and new cut off,
Write in the dust this sent[SEQ_SPLITTER]ence with thy blood,
'Wind-changing Warwick now ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]n change no more.'

WARWICK:
O cheerful colours! s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee where Oxford comes!

OXFORD:
Oxford, Oxford, fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
The gates are open, let [SEQ_SPLITTER]us enter too.

KING EDWARD IV:
So other foes may s[SEQ_SPLITTER]et upon our backs.
Stand we in good array; for the[SEQ_SPLITTER]y no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
If not, the city being but of small defence,
We'l[SEQ_SPLITTER]l quickly rouse the traitors in the same.

WARWICK[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.

MONTA[SEQ_SPLITTER]GUE:
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]R:
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treaso[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING EDWARD IV:
The harder match'd, the greater vic[SEQ_SPLITTER]tory:
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]SOMERSET:
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!

GLOU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CESTER:
Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave sold their lives unto the house of York;
And t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou shalt be the third if this sword hold.

WARWIC[SEQ_SPLITTER]K:
And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
With wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]om an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the[SEQ_SPLITTER] nature of a brother's love!
Come, Clarence, come;[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou wilt, if Warwick call.

CLARENCE:
Father of [SEQ_SPLITTER]Warwick, know you what this means?
Look here, I th[SEQ_SPLITTER]row my infamy at thee
I will not ruinate my father[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s house,
Who gave his blood to lime the stones to[SEQ_SPLITTER]gether,
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, W[SEQ_SPLITTER]arwick,
That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnat[SEQ_SPLITTER]ural,
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against[SEQ_SPLITTER] his brother and his lawful king?
Perhaps thou wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]t object my holy oath:
To keep that oath were more[SEQ_SPLITTER] impiety
Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his d[SEQ_SPLITTER]aughter.
I am so sorry for my trespass made
That, [SEQ_SPLITTER]to deserve well at my brother's hands,
I here proc[SEQ_SPLITTER]laim myself thy mortal foe,
With resolution, where[SEQ_SPLITTER]soe'er I meet thee--
As I will meet thee, if thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]stir abroad--
To plague thee for thy foul misleadi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng me.
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
Pardon[SEQ_SPLITTER] me, Edward, I will make amends:
And, Richard, do [SEQ_SPLITTER]not frown upon my faults,
For I will henceforth be[SEQ_SPLITTER] no more unconstant.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now welcome [SEQ_SPLITTER]more, and ten times more beloved,
Than if thou nev[SEQ_SPLITTER]er hadst deserved our hate.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, [SEQ_SPLITTER]good Clarence; this is brotherlike.

WARWICK:
O pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssing traitor, perjured and unjust!

KING EDWARD I[SEQ_SPLITTER]V:
What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fig[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht?
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
WARWICK:
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I will away towards Barnet presently,
And bid thee[SEQ_SPLITTER] battle, Edward, if thou darest.

KING EDWARD IV:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
Lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds, to the field; Saint George and victory!
3 KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
So, lie thou there: die[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou, and die our fear;
For Warwick was a bug tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t fear'd us all.
Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or thee,
That Warwick's bones may keep thine compa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ny.

WARWICK:
Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend [SEQ_SPLITTER]or foe,
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
My blood,[SEQ_SPLITTER] my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
That I [SEQ_SPLITTER]must yield my body to the earth
And, by my fall, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he conquest to my foe.
Thus yields the cedar to th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e axe's edge,
Whose arms gave shelter to the princ[SEQ_SPLITTER]ely eagle,
Under whose shade the ramping lion slep[SEQ_SPLITTER]t,
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind[SEQ_SPLITTER].
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's bla[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck veil,
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To search the secret treasons of the world:
The w[SEQ_SPLITTER]rinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,
Were l[SEQ_SPLITTER]iken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;
For who lived kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g, but I could dig his grave?
And who durst mine w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen Warwick bent his brow?
Lo, now my glory smear'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d in dust and blood!
My parks, my walks, my manors[SEQ_SPLITTER] that I had.
Even now forsake me, and of all my la[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds
Is nothing left me but my body's length.
Why, [SEQ_SPLITTER]what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
And[SEQ_SPLITTER], live we how we can, yet die we must.

SOMERSET:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.
We migh[SEQ_SPLITTER]t recover all our loss again;
The queen from Franc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hath brought a puissant power:
Even now we heard[SEQ_SPLITTER] the news: ah, could'st thou fly!

WARWICK:
Why, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
If thou be ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, sweet brother, take my hand.
And with thy lips [SEQ_SPLITTER]keep in my soul awhile!
Thou lovest me not; for, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]rother, if thou didst,
Thy tears would wash this c[SEQ_SPLITTER]old congealed blood
That glues my lips and will no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t let me speak.
Come quickly, Montague, or I am de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed[SEQ_SPLITTER] his last;
And to the latest gasp cried out for Wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rwick,
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.[SEQ_SPLITTER]'
And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
That moug[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht not be distinguished; but at last
I well might [SEQ_SPLITTER]hear, delivered with a groan,
'O, farewell, Warwic[SEQ_SPLITTER]k!'

WARWICK:
Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] save yourselves;
For Warwick bids you all farewel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l to meet in heaven.

OXFORD:
Away, away, to meet [SEQ_SPLITTER]the queen's great power!
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDW[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARD IV:
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward cours[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
But,[SEQ_SPLITTER] in the midst of this bright-shining day,
I spy a [SEQ_SPLITTER]black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
That will en[SEQ_SPLITTER]counter with our glorious sun,
Ere he attain his e[SEQ_SPLITTER]aseful western bed:
I mean, my lords, those powers[SEQ_SPLITTER] that the queen
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived[SEQ_SPLITTER] our coast
And, as we hear, march on to fight with[SEQ_SPLITTER] us.

CLARENCE:
A little gale will soon disperse t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat cloud
And blow it to the source from whence it[SEQ_SPLITTER] came:
The very beams will dry those vapours up,
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or every cloud engenders not a storm.

GLOUCESTER:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And S[SEQ_SPLITTER]omerset, with Oxford fled to her:
If she have time[SEQ_SPLITTER] to breathe be well assured
Her faction will be fu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll as strong as ours.

KING EDWARD IV:
We are adve[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtised by our loving friends
That they do hold the[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir course toward Tewksbury:
We, having now the bes[SEQ_SPLITTER]t at Barnet field,
Will thither straight, for will[SEQ_SPLITTER]ingness rids way;
And, as we march, our strength w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill be augmented
In every county as we go along.
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]trike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.
3 KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] HENRY VI

QUEEN MARGARET:
Great lords, wise men n[SEQ_SPLITTER]e'er sit and wail their loss,
But cheerly seek how[SEQ_SPLITTER] to redress their harms.
What though the mast be n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow blown overboard,
The cable broke, the holding-a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nchor lost,
And half our sailors swallow'd in the [SEQ_SPLITTER]flood?
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
Wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more [SEQ_SPLITTER]strength to that which hath too much,
Whiles, in h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is moan, the ship splits on the rock,
Which indust[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry and courage might have saved?
Ah, what a shame![SEQ_SPLITTER] ah, what a fault were this!
Say Warwick was our a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nchor; what of that?
And Montague our topmost; wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of him?
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of these?
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
And Somerset another goodly mast?
The friends of[SEQ_SPLITTER] France our shrouds and tacklings?
And, though uns[SEQ_SPLITTER]kilful, why not Ned and I
For once allow'd the ski[SEQ_SPLITTER]lful pilot's charge?
We will not from the helm to [SEQ_SPLITTER]sit and weep,
But keep our course, though the roug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h wind say no,
From shelves and rocks that threate[SEQ_SPLITTER]n us with wreck.
As good to chide the waves as spe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ak them fair.
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?[SEQ_SPLITTER]
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
And Rich[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard but a ragged fatal rock?
All these the enemies[SEQ_SPLITTER] to our poor bark.
Say you can swim; alas, 'tis bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t a while!
Tread on the sand; why, there you quick[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly sink:
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you[SEQ_SPLITTER] off,
Or else you famish; that's a threefold death[SEQ_SPLITTER].
This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
If c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ase some one of you would fly from us,
That there'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
More than w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
Why, cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rage then! what cannot be avoided
'Twere childish [SEQ_SPLITTER]weakness to lament or fear.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Methin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ks a woman of this valiant spirit
Should, if a cow[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard heard her speak these words,
Infuse his breast[SEQ_SPLITTER] with magnanimity
And make him, naked, foil a man [SEQ_SPLITTER]at arms.
I speak not this as doubting any here
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] did I but suspect a fearful man
He should have le[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave to go away betimes,
Lest in our need he might [SEQ_SPLITTER]infect another
And make him of like spirit to hims[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf.
If any such be here--as God forbid!--
Let him[SEQ_SPLITTER] depart before we need his help.

OXFORD:
Women an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d children of so high a courage,
And warriors fain[SEQ_SPLITTER]t! why, 'twere perpetual shame.
O brave young prin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce! thy famous grandfather
Doth live again in thee[SEQ_SPLITTER]: long mayst thou live
To bear his image and renew[SEQ_SPLITTER] his glories!

SOMERSET:
And he that will not figh[SEQ_SPLITTER]t for such a hope.
Go home to bed, and like the ow[SEQ_SPLITTER]l by day,
If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
QUEEN MARGARET:
Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Ox[SEQ_SPLITTER]ford, thanks.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And take his thanks [SEQ_SPLITTER]that yet hath nothing else.

Messenger:
Prepare yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u, lords, for Edward is at hand.
Ready to fight; t[SEQ_SPLITTER]herefore be resolute.

OXFORD:
I thought no less: [SEQ_SPLITTER]it is his policy
To haste thus fast, to find us un[SEQ_SPLITTER]provided.

SOMERSET:
But he's deceived; we are in [SEQ_SPLITTER]readiness.

QUEEN MARGARET:
This cheers my heart, [SEQ_SPLITTER]to see your forwardness.

OXFORD:
Here pitch our b[SEQ_SPLITTER]attle; hence we will not budge.

KING EDWARD IV:
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]rave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
Whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
I need[SEQ_SPLITTER] not add more fuel to your fire,
For well I wot ye[SEQ_SPLITTER] blaze to burn them out
Give signal to the fight, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and to it, lords!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Lords, knights,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and gentlemen, what I should say
My tears gainsay[SEQ_SPLITTER]; for every word I speak,
Ye see, I drink the wate[SEQ_SPLITTER]r of mine eyes.
Therefore, no more but this: Henry[SEQ_SPLITTER], your sovereign,
Is prisoner to the foe; his stat[SEQ_SPLITTER]e usurp'd,
His realm a slaughter-house, his subjec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ts slain,
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure [SEQ_SPLITTER]spent;
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoi[SEQ_SPLITTER]l.
You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lord[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
Be valiant and give signal to the fight.
3 KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now here a period of tu[SEQ_SPLITTER]multuous broils.
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle [SEQ_SPLITTER]straight:
For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]OXFORD:
For my part, I'll not trouble thee with wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rds.

SOMERSET:
Nor I, but stoop with patience to [SEQ_SPLITTER]my fortune.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So part we sadly in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his troublous world,
To meet with joy in sweet Jer[SEQ_SPLITTER]usalem.

KING EDWARD IV:
Is proclamation made, tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t who finds Edward
Shall have a high reward, and h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e his life?

GLOUCESTER:
It is: and lo, where yout[SEQ_SPLITTER]hful Edward comes!

KING EDWARD IV:
Bring forth th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e gallant, let us hear him speak.
What! can so you[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng a thorn begin to prick?
Edward, what satisfacti[SEQ_SPLITTER]on canst thou make
For bearing arms, for stirring [SEQ_SPLITTER]up my subjects,
And all the trouble thou hast turn[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d me to?

PRINCE EDWARD:
Speak like a subject, pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]oud ambitious York!
Suppose that I am now my fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's mouth;
Resign thy chair, and where I stand kne[SEQ_SPLITTER]el thou,
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee,
Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ah, that thy father had been so [SEQ_SPLITTER]resolved!

GLOUCESTER:
That you might still have w[SEQ_SPLITTER]orn the petticoat,
And ne'er have stol'n the breec[SEQ_SPLITTER]h from Lancaster.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Let AEsop fable [SEQ_SPLITTER]in a winter's night;
His currish riddles sort not [SEQ_SPLITTER]with this place.

GLOUCESTER:
By heaven, brat, I'l[SEQ_SPLITTER]l plague ye for that word.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou wast born to be a plague to men.

GLOUCESTER:
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or God's sake, take away this captive scold.

PRIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]CE EDWARD:
Nay, take away this scolding crookback [SEQ_SPLITTER]rather.

KING EDWARD IV:
Peace, wilful boy, or I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill charm your tongue.

CLARENCE:
Untutor'd lad, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou art too malapert.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I know my du[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty; you are all undutiful:
Lascivious Edward, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou perjured George,
And thou mis-shapen Dick, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]tell ye all
I am your better, traitors as ye are:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.

KIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]G EDWARD IV:
Take that, thou likeness of this rail[SEQ_SPLITTER]er here.

GLOUCESTER:
Sprawl'st thou? take that, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o end thy agony.

CLARENCE:
And there's for twitti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng me with perjury.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, kill me to[SEQ_SPLITTER]o!

GLOUCESTER:
Marry, and shall.

KING EDWARD IV:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]GLOUCESTER:
Why should she live, to fill the world[SEQ_SPLITTER] with words?

KING EDWARD IV:
What, doth she swoon[SEQ_SPLITTER]? use means for her recovery.

GLOUCESTER:
Clarenc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, excuse me to the king my brother;
I'll hence to[SEQ_SPLITTER] London on a serious matter:
Ere ye come there, be[SEQ_SPLITTER] sure to hear some news.

CLARENCE:
What? what?

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]LOUCESTER:
The Tower, the Tower.

QUEEN MARGARET:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
Canst [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
They that s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,
Did not offend[SEQ_SPLITTER], nor were not worthy blame,
If this foul deed wer[SEQ_SPLITTER]e by to equal it:
He was a man; this, in respect, [SEQ_SPLITTER]a child:
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child[SEQ_SPLITTER].
What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
And I[SEQ_SPLITTER] will speak, that so my heart may burst.
Butchers [SEQ_SPLITTER]and villains! bloody cannibals!
How sweet a plant [SEQ_SPLITTER]have you untimely cropp'd!
You have no children, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]utchers! if you had,
The thought of them would hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e stirr'd up remorse:
But if you ever chance to ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve a child,
Look in his youth to have him so cut o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ff
As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young pri[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce!

KING EDWARD IV:
Away with her; go, bear her [SEQ_SPLITTER]hence perforce.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, never bear m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hence, dispatch me here,
Here sheathe thy sword,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I'll pardon thee my death:
What, wilt thou not? t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen, Clarence, do it thou.

CLARENCE:
By heaven, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] will not do thee so much ease.

QUEEN MARGARET:
G[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]CLARENCE:
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not[SEQ_SPLITTER] do it?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, but thou usest to for[SEQ_SPLITTER]swear thyself:
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis char[SEQ_SPLITTER]ity.
What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]tcher,
Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou?
Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;
P[SEQ_SPLITTER]etitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.

KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] EDWARD IV:
Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So come to you and yours, as [SEQ_SPLITTER]to this Prince!

KING EDWARD IV:
Where's Richard g[SEQ_SPLITTER]one?

CLARENCE:
To London, all in post; and, as I [SEQ_SPLITTER]guess,
To make a bloody supper in the Tower.

KING[SEQ_SPLITTER] EDWARD IV:
He's sudden, if a thing comes in his h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ead.
Now march we hence: discharge the common sort[SEQ_SPLITTER]
With pay and thanks, and let's away to London
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] see our gentle queen how well she fares:
By this,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I hope, she hath a son for me.
3 KING HENRY VI

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]LOUCESTER:
Good day, my lord. What, at your book s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o hard?

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, my good lord:--my lord[SEQ_SPLITTER], I should say rather;
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good'[SEQ_SPLITTER] was little better:
'Good Gloucester' and 'good de[SEQ_SPLITTER]vil' were alike,
And both preposterous; therefore,[SEQ_SPLITTER] not 'good lord.'

GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, leave us to[SEQ_SPLITTER] ourselves: we must confer.

KING HENRY VI:
So fli[SEQ_SPLITTER]es the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
So first t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
And next h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is throat unto the butcher's knife.
What scene of [SEQ_SPLITTER]death hath Roscius now to act?

GLOUCESTER:
Suspic[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion always haunts the guilty mind;
The thief doth [SEQ_SPLITTER]fear each bush an officer.

KING HENRY VI:
The bir[SEQ_SPLITTER]d that hath been limed in a bush,
With trembling w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ings misdoubteth every bush;
And I, the hapless ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]le to one sweet bird,
Have now the fatal object in[SEQ_SPLITTER] my eye
Where my poor young was limed, was caught [SEQ_SPLITTER]and kill'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what a peevish fool [SEQ_SPLITTER]was that of Crete,
That taught his son the office [SEQ_SPLITTER]of a fowl!
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was[SEQ_SPLITTER] drown'd.

KING HENRY VI:
I, Daedalus; my poor boy[SEQ_SPLITTER], Icarus;
Thy father, Minos, that denied our cours[SEQ_SPLITTER]e;
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
Whose envio[SEQ_SPLITTER]us gulf did swallow up his life.
Ah, kill me with [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy weapon, not with words!
My breast can better b[SEQ_SPLITTER]rook thy dagger's point
Than can my ears that trag[SEQ_SPLITTER]ic history.
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for[SEQ_SPLITTER] my life?

GLOUCESTER:
Think'st thou I am an execu[SEQ_SPLITTER]tioner?

KING HENRY VI:
A persecutor, I am sure, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou art:
If murdering innocents be executing,
Why,[SEQ_SPLITTER] then thou art an executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
Thy so[SEQ_SPLITTER]n I kill'd for his presumption.

KING HENRY VI:
Ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]dst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
Which now m[SEQ_SPLITTER]istrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an old man'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s sigh and many a widow's,
And many an orphan's wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter-standing eye--
Men for their sons, wives for t[SEQ_SPLITTER]heir husbands,
And orphans for their parents timel[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess death--
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast[SEQ_SPLITTER] born.
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sig[SEQ_SPLITTER]n;
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
Do[SEQ_SPLITTER]gs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
And chat[SEQ_SPLITTER]tering pies in dismal discords sung.
Thy mother fe[SEQ_SPLITTER]lt more than a mother's pain,
And, yet brought for[SEQ_SPLITTER]th less than a mother's hope,
To wit, an indigeste[SEQ_SPLITTER]d and deformed lump,
Not like the fruit of such a [SEQ_SPLITTER]goodly tree.
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u wast born,
To signify thou camest to bite the wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rld:
And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Thou camest--

GLOUCESTER:
I'll hear no more: die,[SEQ_SPLITTER] prophet in thy speech:
For this amongst the rest,[SEQ_SPLITTER] was I ordain'd.

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, and for much [SEQ_SPLITTER]more slaughter after this.
God forgive my sins, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d pardon thee!

GLOUCESTER:
What, will the aspirin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g blood of Lancaster
Sink in the ground? I thought[SEQ_SPLITTER] it would have mounted.
See how my sword weeps for[SEQ_SPLITTER] the poor king's death!
O, may such purple tears b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e alway shed
From those that wish the downfall of [SEQ_SPLITTER]our house!
If any spark of life be yet remaining,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER], that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
Indeed, [SEQ_SPLITTER]'tis true that Henry told me of;
For I have often [SEQ_SPLITTER]heard my mother say
I came into the world with my [SEQ_SPLITTER]legs forward:
Had I not reason, think ye, to make [SEQ_SPLITTER]haste,
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
'O, Jesu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s bless us, he is born with teeth!'
And so I was; [SEQ_SPLITTER]which plainly signified
That I should snarl and bi[SEQ_SPLITTER]te and play the dog.
Then, since the heavens have [SEQ_SPLITTER]shaped my body so,
Let hell make crook'd my mind t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o answer it.
I have no brother, I am like no broth[SEQ_SPLITTER]er;
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call di[SEQ_SPLITTER]vine,
Be resident in men like one another
And not [SEQ_SPLITTER]in me: I am myself alone.
Clarence, beware; thou k[SEQ_SPLITTER]eep'st me from the light:
But I will sort a pitchy[SEQ_SPLITTER] day for thee;
For I will buz abroad such propheci[SEQ_SPLITTER]es
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
And t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
King He[SEQ_SPLITTER]nry and the prince his son are gone:
Clarence, thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] turn is next, and then the rest,
Counting myself [SEQ_SPLITTER]but bad till I be best.
I'll throw thy body in ano[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther room
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Once more we sit [SEQ_SPLITTER]in England's royal throne,
Re-purchased with the b[SEQ_SPLITTER]lood of enemies.
What valiant foemen, like to autu[SEQ_SPLITTER]mn's corn,
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Clifford[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, as the father and the son,
And two Northumberla[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds; two braver men
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the trumpet's sound;
With them, the two brave be[SEQ_SPLITTER]ars, Warwick and Montague,
That in their chains fe[SEQ_SPLITTER]tter'd the kingly lion
And made the forest tremble[SEQ_SPLITTER] when they roar'd.
Thus have we swept suspicion fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om our seat
And made our footstool of security.
Co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
Young Ned[SEQ_SPLITTER], for thee, thine uncles and myself
Have in our ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]mours watch'd the winter's night,
Went all afoot i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n summer's scalding heat,
That thou mightst reposs[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess the crown in peace;
And of our labours thou sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]alt reap the gain.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
C[SEQ_SPLITTER]larence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.

CLARENC[SEQ_SPLITTER]E:
The duty that I owe unto your majesty
I seal up[SEQ_SPLITTER]on the lips of this sweet babe.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]LOUCESTER:
And, that I love the tree from whence t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou sprang'st,
Witness the loving kiss I give the [SEQ_SPLITTER]fruit.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now am I seated as my soul[SEQ_SPLITTER] delights,
Having my country's peace and brothers'[SEQ_SPLITTER] loves.

CLARENCE:
What will your grace have done [SEQ_SPLITTER]with Margaret?
Reignier, her father, to the king o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f France
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] hither have they sent it for her ransom.

KING ED[SEQ_SPLITTER]WARD IV:
Away with her, and waft her hence to Fran[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce.
And now what rests but that we spend the time
[SEQ_SPLITTER]With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
Such [SEQ_SPLITTER]as befits the pleasure of the court?
Sound drums a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
For here, I hope[SEQ_SPLITTER], begins our lasting joy.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If you shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
the like o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ccasion whereon my services are now on
foot, you s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall see, as I have said, great
difference betwixt[SEQ_SPLITTER] our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I think, [SEQ_SPLITTER]this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
means to p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him[SEQ_SPLITTER].

ARCHIDAMUS:
Wherein our entertainment shall sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]me us we will be
justified in our loves; for indee[SEQ_SPLITTER]d--

CAMILLO:
Beseech you,--

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
we cann[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
not [SEQ_SPLITTER]what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
that [SEQ_SPLITTER]your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse[SEQ_SPLITTER]
us.

CAMILLO:
You pay a great deal too dear for w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat's given freely.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Believe me, I spe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]nesty puts it to utterance.

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cann[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ained together in their childhoods; and
there root[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed betwixt them then such an affection,
which cann[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot choose but branch now. Since their
more mature [SEQ_SPLITTER]dignities and royal necessities made
separation of[SEQ_SPLITTER] their society, their encounters,
though not perso[SEQ_SPLITTER]nal, have been royally attorneyed
with interchange[SEQ_SPLITTER] of gifts, letters, loving
embassies; that they ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve seemed to be together,
though absent, shook han[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it were, from[SEQ_SPLITTER] the ends of opposed
winds. The heavens continue t[SEQ_SPLITTER]heir loves!

ARCHIDAMUS:
I think there is not in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he world either malice or
matter to alter it. You [SEQ_SPLITTER]have an unspeakable
comfort of your young prince M[SEQ_SPLITTER]amillius: it is a
gentleman of the greatest promis[SEQ_SPLITTER]e that ever came
into my note.

CAMILLO:
I very we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll agree with you in the hopes of him: it
is a gal[SEQ_SPLITTER]lant child; one that indeed physics the
subject, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]akes old hearts fresh: they that went on
crutches [SEQ_SPLITTER]ere he was born desire yet their life to
see him a[SEQ_SPLITTER] man.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they else be content to d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ie?

CAMILLO:
Yes; if there were no other excuse w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy they should
desire to live.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If the[SEQ_SPLITTER] king had no son, they would desire to live
on cru[SEQ_SPLITTER]tches till he had one.

POLIXENES:
Nine changes of[SEQ_SPLITTER] the watery star hath been
The shepherd's note sin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce we have left our throne
Without a burthen: time[SEQ_SPLITTER] as long again
Would be find up, my brother, with [SEQ_SPLITTER]our thanks;
And yet we should, for perpetuity,
Go [SEQ_SPLITTER]hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
Yet s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tanding in rich place, I multiply
With one 'We tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]nk you' many thousands moe
That go before it.

LEO[SEQ_SPLITTER]NTES:
Stay your thanks a while;
And pay them when [SEQ_SPLITTER]you part.

POLIXENES:
Sir, that's to-morrow.
I am [SEQ_SPLITTER]question'd by my fears, of what may chance
Or bree[SEQ_SPLITTER]d upon our absence; that may blow
No sneaping wind[SEQ_SPLITTER]s at home, to make us say
'This is put forth too t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ruly:' besides, I have stay'd
To tire your royalty[SEQ_SPLITTER].

LEONTES:
We are tougher, brother,
Than you can [SEQ_SPLITTER]put us to't.

POLIXENES:
No longer stay.

LEONTES:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
One seven-night longer.

POLIXENES:
Very sooth, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o-morrow.

LEONTES:
We'll part the time between's [SEQ_SPLITTER]then; and in that
I'll no gainsaying.

POLIXENES:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Press me not, beseech you, so.
There is no tongue [SEQ_SPLITTER]that moves, none, none i' the world,
So soon as yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]urs could win me: so it should now,
Were there nec[SEQ_SPLITTER]essity in your request, although
'Twere needful I [SEQ_SPLITTER]denied it. My affairs
Do even drag me homeward: wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich to hinder
Were in your love a whip to me; my s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tay
To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
Far[SEQ_SPLITTER]ewell, our brother.

LEONTES:
Tongue-tied, our que[SEQ_SPLITTER]en?
speak you.

HERMIONE:
I had thought, sir, to h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave held my peace until
You have drawn oaths from [SEQ_SPLITTER]him not to stay. You, sir,
Charge him too coldly. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Tell him, you are sure
All in Bohemia's well; this[SEQ_SPLITTER] satisfaction
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this[SEQ_SPLITTER] to him,
He's beat from his best ward.

LEONTES:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell said, Hermione.

HERMIONE:
To tell, he longs t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o see his son, were strong:
But let him say so the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, and let him go;
But let him swear so, and he sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all not stay,
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
The bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my lord, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I'll give him my commission
To let him there a mon[SEQ_SPLITTER]th behind the gest
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, go[SEQ_SPLITTER]od deed, Leontes,
I love thee not a jar o' the clo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck behind
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?

PO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LIXENES:
No, madam.

HERMIONE:
Nay, but you will?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
POLIXENES:
I may not, verily.

HERMIONE:
Verily!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]You put me off with limber vows; but I,
Though you[SEQ_SPLITTER] would seek to unsphere the
stars with oaths,
Shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
You shall not [SEQ_SPLITTER]go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
As potent as a lord's. Wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll you go yet?
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
When[SEQ_SPLITTER] you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
My[SEQ_SPLITTER] prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
On[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of them you shall be.

POLIXENES:
Your guest, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]en, madam:
To be your prisoner should import offen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ding;
Which is for me less easy to commit
Than you[SEQ_SPLITTER] to punish.

HERMIONE:
Not your gaoler, then,
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
Of my l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
You wer[SEQ_SPLITTER]e pretty lordings then?

POLIXENES:
We were, fair [SEQ_SPLITTER]queen,
Two lads that thought there was no more beh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ind
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
And to be [SEQ_SPLITTER]boy eternal.

HERMIONE:
Was not my lord
The verier[SEQ_SPLITTER] wag o' the two?

POLIXENES:
We were as twinn'd la[SEQ_SPLITTER]mbs that did frisk i' the sun,
And bleat the one a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the other: what we changed
Was innocence for inn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ocence; we knew not
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor[SEQ_SPLITTER] dream'd
That any did. Had we pursued that life,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
With [SEQ_SPLITTER]stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
Bol[SEQ_SPLITTER]dly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
Hereditar[SEQ_SPLITTER]y ours.

HERMIONE:
By this we gather
You have trip[SEQ_SPLITTER]p'd since.

POLIXENES:
O my most sacred lady!
Temp[SEQ_SPLITTER]tations have since then been born to's; for
In tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]se unfledged days was my wife a girl;
Your preciou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s self had then not cross'd the eyes
Of my young p[SEQ_SPLITTER]lay-fellow.

HERMIONE:
Grace to boot!
Of this make[SEQ_SPLITTER] no conclusion, lest you say
Your queen and I are [SEQ_SPLITTER]devils: yet go on;
The offences we have made you d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o we'll answer,
If you first sinn'd with us and th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at with us
You did continue fault and that you sli[SEQ_SPLITTER]pp'd not
With any but with us.

LEONTES:
Is he won[SEQ_SPLITTER] yet?

HERMIONE:
He'll stay my lord.

LEONTES:
At [SEQ_SPLITTER]my request he would not.
Hermione, my dearest, tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u never spokest
To better purpose.

HERMIONE:
Neve[SEQ_SPLITTER]r?

LEONTES:
Never, but once.

HERMIONE:
What! hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I twice said well? when was't before?
I prithee [SEQ_SPLITTER]tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
As fat as [SEQ_SPLITTER]tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
Slaugh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ters a thousand waiting upon that.
Our praises are[SEQ_SPLITTER] our wages: you may ride's
With one soft kiss a th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ousand furlongs ere
With spur we beat an acre. But[SEQ_SPLITTER] to the goal:
My last good deed was to entreat his[SEQ_SPLITTER] stay:
What was my first? it has an elder sister,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
Nay, l[SEQ_SPLITTER]et me have't; I long.

LEONTES:
Why, that was when[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]th,
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
'I am [SEQ_SPLITTER]yours for ever.'

HERMIONE:
'Tis grace indeed.
Why[SEQ_SPLITTER], lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
The other [SEQ_SPLITTER]for some while a friend.

LEONTES:

MAMILLIUS:
Ay,[SEQ_SPLITTER] my good lord.

LEONTES:
I' fecks!
Why, that's my [SEQ_SPLITTER]bawcock. What, hast
smutch'd thy nose?
They say it[SEQ_SPLITTER] is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
We must be [SEQ_SPLITTER]neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
And yet the [SEQ_SPLITTER]steer, the heifer and the calf
Are all call'd neat[SEQ_SPLITTER].--Still virginalling
Upon his palm!--How now, you[SEQ_SPLITTER] wanton calf!
Art thou my calf?

MAMILLIUS:
Yes, i[SEQ_SPLITTER]f you will, my lord.

LEONTES:
Thou want'st a roug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h pash and the shoots that I have,
To be full like[SEQ_SPLITTER] me: yet they say we are
Almost as like as eggs; w[SEQ_SPLITTER]omen say so,
That will say anything but were they [SEQ_SPLITTER]false
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, fal[SEQ_SPLITTER]se
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
No b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
To say [SEQ_SPLITTER]this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
Look on me [SEQ_SPLITTER]with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
Most dear'st![SEQ_SPLITTER] my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
Affection! t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy intention stabs the centre:
Thou dost make poss[SEQ_SPLITTER]ible things not so held,
Communicatest with dreams[SEQ_SPLITTER];--how can this be?--
With what's unreal thou coac[SEQ_SPLITTER]tive art,
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very cr[SEQ_SPLITTER]edent
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]dost,
And that beyond commission, and I find it,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd that to the infection of my brains
And hardenin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g of my brows.

POLIXENES:
What means Sicilia?

HE[SEQ_SPLITTER]RMIONE:
He something seems unsettled.

POLIXENES:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]How, my lord!
What cheer? how is't with you, best [SEQ_SPLITTER]brother?

HERMIONE:
You look as if you held a brow[SEQ_SPLITTER] of much distraction
Are you moved, my lord?

LEON[SEQ_SPLITTER]TES:
No, in good earnest.
How sometimes nature wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l betray its folly,
Its tenderness, and make itsel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f a pastime
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-[SEQ_SPLITTER]three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
In my gree[SEQ_SPLITTER]n velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ite its master, and so prove,
As ornaments oft do,[SEQ_SPLITTER] too dangerous:
How like, methought, I then was to[SEQ_SPLITTER] this kernel,
This squash, this gentleman. Mine ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]nest friend,
Will you take eggs for money?

MAMILL[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
No, my lord, I'll fight.

LEONTES:
You will! [SEQ_SPLITTER]why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
Are you so f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ond of your young prince as we
Do seem to be of ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs?

POLIXENES:
If at home, sir,
He's all my exerc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ise, my mirth, my matter,
Now my sworn friend and [SEQ_SPLITTER]then mine enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, statesma[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, all:
He makes a July's day short as December,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts[SEQ_SPLITTER] that would thick my blood.

LEONTES:
So stands th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is squire
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd,
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
Next to thys[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf and my young rover, he's
Apparent to my heart.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

HERMIONE:
If you would seek us,
We are yours i' [SEQ_SPLITTER]the garden: shall's attend you there?

LEONTES:
To[SEQ_SPLITTER] your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
Be y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou beneath the sky.
I am angling now,
Though you p[SEQ_SPLITTER]erceive me not how I give line.
Go to, go to!
How [SEQ_SPLITTER]she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
And arms he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r with the boldness of a wife
To her allowing husb[SEQ_SPLITTER]and!
Gone already!
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]d and
ears a fork'd one!
Go, play, boy, play: thy [SEQ_SPLITTER]mother plays, and I
Play too, but so disgraced a p[SEQ_SPLITTER]art, whose issue
Will hiss me to my grave: contemp[SEQ_SPLITTER]t and clamour
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, pla[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.
There have been,
Or I am much deceived, cuckold[SEQ_SPLITTER]s ere now;
And many a man there is, even at this p[SEQ_SPLITTER]resent,
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by [SEQ_SPLITTER]the arm,
That little thinks she has been sluiced i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n's absence
And his pond fish'd by his next neighb[SEQ_SPLITTER]our, by
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's com[SEQ_SPLITTER]fort in't
Whiles other men have gates and those ga[SEQ_SPLITTER]tes open'd,
As mine, against their will. Should al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l despair
That have revolted wives, the tenth of m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ankind
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s none;
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
Whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]re 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
No barricado for a belly; know't;
It will let in [SEQ_SPLITTER]and out the enemy
With bag and baggage: many thous[SEQ_SPLITTER]and on's
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now[SEQ_SPLITTER], boy!

MAMILLIUS:
I am like you, they say.

LEONT[SEQ_SPLITTER]ES:
Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
CAMILLO:
Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES:
Go play, Mam[SEQ_SPLITTER]illius; thou'rt an honest man.
Camillo, this great[SEQ_SPLITTER] sir will yet stay longer.

CAMILLO:
You had much [SEQ_SPLITTER]ado to make his anchor hold:
When you cast out, it[SEQ_SPLITTER] still came home.

LEONTES:
Didst note it?

CAMILL[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
He would not stay at your petitions: made
His b[SEQ_SPLITTER]usiness more material.

LEONTES:
Didst perceive it[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
They're here with me already, whispering, roundi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
When I [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
That he d[SEQ_SPLITTER]id stay?

CAMILLO:
At the good queen's entreaty.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]LEONTES:
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be per[SEQ_SPLITTER]tinent
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
By[SEQ_SPLITTER] any understanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit[SEQ_SPLITTER] is soaking, will draw in
More than the common blo[SEQ_SPLITTER]cks: not noted, is't,
But of the finer natures? by[SEQ_SPLITTER] some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower [SEQ_SPLITTER]messes
Perchance are to this business purblind? sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.

CAMILLO:
Business, my lord! I think most under[SEQ_SPLITTER]stand
Bohemia stays here longer.

LEONTES:
Ha!

CA[SEQ_SPLITTER]MILLO:
Stays here longer.

LEONTES:
Ay, but why?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]CAMILLO:
To satisfy your highness and the entreati[SEQ_SPLITTER]es
Of our most gracious mistress.

LEONTES:
Satisf[SEQ_SPLITTER]y!
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
Let t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
With al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l the nearest things to my heart, as well
My chamb[SEQ_SPLITTER]er-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
Hast clean[SEQ_SPLITTER]sed my bosom, I from thee departed
Thy penitent re[SEQ_SPLITTER]form'd: but we have been
Deceived in thy integrity[SEQ_SPLITTER], deceived
In that which seems so.

CAMILLO:
Be it[SEQ_SPLITTER] forbid, my lord!

LEONTES:
To bide upon't, thou a[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt not honest, or,
If thou inclinest that way, tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u art a coward,
Which hoxes honesty behind, restra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ining
From course required; or else thou must be c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ounted
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And t[SEQ_SPLITTER]herein negligent; or else a fool
That seest a game[SEQ_SPLITTER] play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
And takest it [SEQ_SPLITTER]all for jest.

CAMILLO:
My gracious lord,
I may be[SEQ_SPLITTER] negligent, foolish and fearful;
In every one of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hese no man is free,
But that his negligence, his [SEQ_SPLITTER]folly, fear,
Among the infinite doings of the worl[SEQ_SPLITTER]d,
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]If ever I were wilful-negligent,
It was my folly; [SEQ_SPLITTER]if industriously
I play'd the fool, it was my negl[SEQ_SPLITTER]igence,
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
Where o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f the execution did cry out
Against the non-perfor[SEQ_SPLITTER]mance, 'twas a fear
Which oft infects the wisest: [SEQ_SPLITTER]these, my lord,
Are such allow'd infirmities that [SEQ_SPLITTER]honesty
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
By it[SEQ_SPLITTER]s own visage: if I then deny it,
'Tis none of mine[SEQ_SPLITTER].

LEONTES:
Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
But that'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
Is thick[SEQ_SPLITTER]er than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sion so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute,--or though[SEQ_SPLITTER]t,--for cogitation
Resides not in that man that do[SEQ_SPLITTER]es not think,--
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt [SEQ_SPLITTER]confess,
Or else be impudently negative,
To have n[SEQ_SPLITTER]or eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
My wife's a[SEQ_SPLITTER] hobby-horse, deserves a name
As rank as any flax-[SEQ_SPLITTER]wench that puts to
Before her troth-plight: say't [SEQ_SPLITTER]and justify't.

CAMILLO:
I would not be a stander-[SEQ_SPLITTER]by to hear
My sovereign mistress clouded so, witho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u never spoke what did become you less
Than this; [SEQ_SPLITTER]which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that, thoug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h true.

LEONTES:
Is whispering nothing?
Is leanin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Kissing with i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nside lip? stopping the career
Of laughing with a [SEQ_SPLITTER]sigh?--a note infallible
Of breaking honesty--hors[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing foot on foot?
Skulking in corners? wishing clo[SEQ_SPLITTER]cks more swift?
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d all eyes
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, [SEQ_SPLITTER]theirs only,
That would unseen be wicked? is this [SEQ_SPLITTER]nothing?
Why, then the world and all that's in't i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s nothing;
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia no[SEQ_SPLITTER]thing;
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these [SEQ_SPLITTER]nothings,
If this be nothing.

CAMILLO:
Good my lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd, be cured
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes[SEQ_SPLITTER];
For 'tis most dangerous.

LEONTES:
Say it be, 't[SEQ_SPLITTER]is true.

CAMILLO:
No, no, my lord.

LEONTES:
It i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s; you lie, you lie:
I say thou liest, Camillo, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d I hate thee,
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mind[SEQ_SPLITTER]less slave,
Or else a hovering temporizer, that
Ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]nst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
Inc[SEQ_SPLITTER]lining to them both: were my wife's liver
Infected[SEQ_SPLITTER] as her life, she would not live
The running of on[SEQ_SPLITTER]e glass.

CAMILLO:
Who does infect her?

LEONTES:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
About[SEQ_SPLITTER] his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
Had servants true ab[SEQ_SPLITTER]out me, that bare eyes
To see alike mine honour as[SEQ_SPLITTER] their profits,
Their own particular thrifts, they[SEQ_SPLITTER] would do that
Which should undo more doing: ay, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd thou,
His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
P[SEQ_SPLITTER]lainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
To give [SEQ_SPLITTER]mine enemy a lasting wink;
Which draught to me wer[SEQ_SPLITTER]e cordial.

CAMILLO:
Sir, my lord,
I could do this[SEQ_SPLITTER], and that with no rash potion,
But with a lingeri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng dram that should not work
Maliciously like pois[SEQ_SPLITTER]on: but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ead mistress,
So sovereignly being honourable.
I h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave loved thee,--

LEONTES:
Make that thy question[SEQ_SPLITTER], and go rot!
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed,
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]purity and whiteness of my sheets,
Which to preser[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve is sleep, which being spotted
Is goads, thorns,[SEQ_SPLITTER] nettles, tails of wasps,
Give scandal to the bloo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d o' the prince my son,
Who I do think is mine and[SEQ_SPLITTER] love as mine,
Without ripe moving to't? Would I d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o this?
Could man so blench?

CAMILLO:
I must beli[SEQ_SPLITTER]eve you, sir:
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for[SEQ_SPLITTER]'t;
Provided that, when he's removed, your highnes[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
Will take again your queen as yours at first,
Ev[SEQ_SPLITTER]en for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd allied to yours.

LEONTES:
Thou dost advise me
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Even so as I mine own course have set down:
I'll g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive no blemish to her honour, none.

CAMILLO:
My l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord,
Go then; and with a countenance as clear
As f[SEQ_SPLITTER]riendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
And w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith your queen. I am his cupbearer:
If from me he [SEQ_SPLITTER]have wholesome beverage,
Account me not your serva[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt.

LEONTES:
This is all:
Do't and thou hast the [SEQ_SPLITTER]one half of my heart;
Do't not, thou split'st thin[SEQ_SPLITTER]e own.

CAMILLO:
I'll do't, my lord.

LEONTES:
I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.

CAMIL[SEQ_SPLITTER]LO:
O miserable lady! But, for me,
What case stand[SEQ_SPLITTER] I in? I must be the poisoner
Of good Polixenes; a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd my ground to do't
Is the obedience to a master,[SEQ_SPLITTER] one
Who in rebellion with himself will have
All t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat are his so too. To do this deed,
Promotion fol[SEQ_SPLITTER]lows. If I could find example
Of thousands that ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]d struck anointed kings
And flourish'd after, I'ld[SEQ_SPLITTER] not do't; but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parch[SEQ_SPLITTER]ment bears not one,
Let villany itself forswear't.[SEQ_SPLITTER] I must
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is cert[SEQ_SPLITTER]ain
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
Her[SEQ_SPLITTER]e comes Bohemia.

POLIXENES:
This is strange: meth[SEQ_SPLITTER]inks
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
Goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d day, Camillo.

CAMILLO:
Hail, most royal sir!

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLIXENES:
What is the news i' the court?

CAMILLO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
None rare, my lord.

POLIXENES:
The king hath on [SEQ_SPLITTER]him such a countenance
As he had lost some provinc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e and a region
Loved as he loves himself: even now[SEQ_SPLITTER] I met him
With customary compliment; when he,
Waf[SEQ_SPLITTER]ting his eyes to the contrary and falling
A lip of[SEQ_SPLITTER] much contempt, speeds from me and
So leaves me to[SEQ_SPLITTER] consider what is breeding
That changeth thus his [SEQ_SPLITTER]manners.

CAMILLO:
I dare not know, my lord.

POLI[SEQ_SPLITTER]XENES:
How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e not?
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
For[SEQ_SPLITTER], to yourself, what you do know, you must.
And can[SEQ_SPLITTER]not say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
Your changed [SEQ_SPLITTER]complexions are to me a mirror
Which shows me mine[SEQ_SPLITTER] changed too; for I must be
A party in this altera[SEQ_SPLITTER]tion, finding
Myself thus alter'd with 't.

CAMILL[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in di[SEQ_SPLITTER]stemper, but
I cannot name the disease; and it is [SEQ_SPLITTER]caught
Of you that yet are well.

POLIXENES:
How! [SEQ_SPLITTER]caught of me!
Make me not sighted like the basilis[SEQ_SPLITTER]k:
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the b[SEQ_SPLITTER]etter
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--[SEQ_SPLITTER]
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
Clerk-l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ike experienced, which no less adorns
Our gentry t[SEQ_SPLITTER]han our parents' noble names,
In whose success we [SEQ_SPLITTER]are gentle,--I beseech you,
If you know aught whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h does behove my knowledge
Thereof to be inform'd,[SEQ_SPLITTER] imprison't not
In ignorant concealment.

CAMILLO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I may not answer.

POLIXENES:
A sickness caught o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f me, and yet I well!
I must be answer'd. Dost tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u hear, Camillo,
I conjure thee, by all the parts [SEQ_SPLITTER]of man
Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the [SEQ_SPLITTER]least
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
[SEQ_SPLITTER]What incidency thou dost guess of harm
Is creeping[SEQ_SPLITTER] toward me; how far off, how near;
Which way to be[SEQ_SPLITTER] prevented, if to be;
If not, how best to bear it.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

CAMILLO:
Sir, I will tell you;
Since I am charge[SEQ_SPLITTER]d in honour and by him
That I think honourable: th[SEQ_SPLITTER]erefore mark my counsel,
Which must be even as swi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ftly follow'd as
I mean to utter it, or both yours[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf and me
Cry lost, and so good night!

POLIXENES[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
On, good Camillo.

CAMILLO:
I am appointed him t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o murder you.

POLIXENES:
By whom, Camillo?

CAMIL[SEQ_SPLITTER]LO:
By the king.

POLIXENES:
For what?

CAMILLO:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]e thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
As h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e had seen't or been an instrument
To vice you to'[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, that you have touch'd his queen
Forbiddenly.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLIXENES:
O, then my best blood turn
To an infecte[SEQ_SPLITTER]d jelly and my name
Be yoked with his that did bet[SEQ_SPLITTER]ray the Best!
Turn then my freshest reputation to
[SEQ_SPLITTER]A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
Where[SEQ_SPLITTER] I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
Nay, hated [SEQ_SPLITTER]too, worse than the great'st infection
That e'er w[SEQ_SPLITTER]as heard or read!

CAMILLO:
Swear his thought over[SEQ_SPLITTER]
By each particular star in heaven and
By all thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r influences, you may as well
Forbid the sea for t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
Is p[SEQ_SPLITTER]iled upon his faith and will continue
The standing[SEQ_SPLITTER] of his body.

POLIXENES:
How should this grow?

C[SEQ_SPLITTER]AMILLO:
I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
Av[SEQ_SPLITTER]oid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
If t[SEQ_SPLITTER]herefore you dare trust my honesty,
That lies encl[SEQ_SPLITTER]osed in this trunk which you
Shall bear along impa[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn'd, away to-night!
Your followers I will whisper[SEQ_SPLITTER] to the business,
And will by twos and threes at s[SEQ_SPLITTER]everal posterns
Clear them o' the city. For myself[SEQ_SPLITTER], I'll put
My fortunes to your service, which are [SEQ_SPLITTER]here
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
For[SEQ_SPLITTER], by the honour of my parents, I
Have utter'd trut[SEQ_SPLITTER]h: which if you seek to prove,
I dare not stand by[SEQ_SPLITTER]; nor shall you be safer
Than one condemn'd by the[SEQ_SPLITTER] king's own mouth, thereon
His execution sworn.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLIXENES:
I do believe thee:
I saw his heart in 's[SEQ_SPLITTER] face. Give me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and thy pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]aces shall
Still neighbour mine. My ships are read[SEQ_SPLITTER]y and
My people did expect my hence departure
Two [SEQ_SPLITTER]days ago. This jealousy
Is for a precious creature[SEQ_SPLITTER]: as she's rare,
Must it be great, and as his pers[SEQ_SPLITTER]on's mighty,
Must it be violent, and as he does co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nceive
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
Profe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss'd to him, why, his revenges must
In that be mad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
Good expedition[SEQ_SPLITTER] be my friend, and comfort
The gracious queen, par[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of his theme, but nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspi[SEQ_SPLITTER]cion! Come, Camillo;
I will respect thee as a fath[SEQ_SPLITTER]er if
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid[SEQ_SPLITTER].

CAMILLO:
It is in mine authority to command
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] keys of all the posterns: please your highness
To[SEQ_SPLITTER] take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

HERMIONE:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
'Tis past[SEQ_SPLITTER] enduring.

First Lady:
Come, my gracious lord,
Sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all I be your playfellow?

MAMILLIUS:
No, I'll non[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of you.

First Lady:
Why, my sweet lord?

MAMILL[SEQ_SPLITTER]IUS:
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere a baby still. I love you better.

Second Lady:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And why so, my lord?

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Become some women best, so that there be not
Too [SEQ_SPLITTER]much hair there, but in a semicircle
Or a half-moo[SEQ_SPLITTER]n made with a pen.

Second Lady:
Who taught you th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is?

MAMILLIUS:
I learnt it out of women's faces. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Pray now
What colour are your eyebrows?

First Lad[SEQ_SPLITTER]y:
Blue, my lord.

MAMILLIUS:
Nay, that's a mock: [SEQ_SPLITTER]I have seen a lady's nose
That has been blue, but [SEQ_SPLITTER]not her eyebrows.

First Lady:
Hark ye;
The queen [SEQ_SPLITTER]your mother rounds apace: we shall
Present our ser[SEQ_SPLITTER]vices to a fine new prince
One of these days; and [SEQ_SPLITTER]then you'ld wanton with us,
If we would have you.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Second Lady:
She is spread of late
Into a goodly [SEQ_SPLITTER]bulk: good time encounter her!

HERMIONE:
What wis[SEQ_SPLITTER]dom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
I am for you[SEQ_SPLITTER] again: pray you, sit by us,
And tell 's a tale.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MAMILLIUS:
Merry or sad shall't be?

HERMIONE:
As [SEQ_SPLITTER]merry as you will.

MAMILLIUS:
A sad tale's best f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or winter: I have one
Of sprites and goblins.

HER[SEQ_SPLITTER]MIONE:
Let's have that, good sir.
Come on, sit dow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n: come on, and do your best
To fright me with you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r sprites; you're powerful at it.

MAMILLIUS:
Ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e was a man--

HERMIONE:
Nay, come, sit down; then[SEQ_SPLITTER] on.

MAMILLIUS:
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l it softly;
Yond crickets shall not hear it.

HER[SEQ_SPLITTER]MIONE:
Come on, then,
And give't me in mine ear.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]LEONTES:
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with[SEQ_SPLITTER] him?

First Lord:
Behind the tuft of pines I met [SEQ_SPLITTER]them; never
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eye[SEQ_SPLITTER]d them
Even to their ships.

LEONTES:
How blest am[SEQ_SPLITTER] I
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, [SEQ_SPLITTER]for lesser knowledge! how accursed
In being so ble[SEQ_SPLITTER]st! There may be in the cup
A spider steep'd, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or his knowledge
Is not infected: but if one prese[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
[SEQ_SPLITTER]How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
With violent hefts. I have drunk,
and seen the sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ider.
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere is a plot against my life, my crown;
All's tru[SEQ_SPLITTER]e that is mistrusted: that false villain
Whom I em[SEQ_SPLITTER]ploy'd was pre-employ'd by him:
He has discover'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]my design, and I
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a ve[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry trick
For them to play at will. How came the po[SEQ_SPLITTER]sterns
So easily open?

First Lord:
By his great a[SEQ_SPLITTER]uthority;
Which often hath no less prevail'd than [SEQ_SPLITTER]so
On your command.

LEONTES:
I know't too well.
G[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hough he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Have [SEQ_SPLITTER]too much blood in him.

HERMIONE:
What is this? sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ort?

LEONTES:
Bear the boy hence; he shall not co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me about her;
Away with him! and let her sport her[SEQ_SPLITTER]self
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Has made thee swell thus.

HERMIONE:
But I'ld say [SEQ_SPLITTER]he had not,
And I'll be sworn you would believe my[SEQ_SPLITTER] saying,
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.

LEONTES[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
You, my lords,
Look on her, mark her well; be bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t about
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
The jus[SEQ_SPLITTER]tice of your bearts will thereto add
'Tis pity she[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s not honest, honourable:'
Praise her but for thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s her without-door form,
Which on my faith deserve[SEQ_SPLITTER]s high speech, and straight
The shrug, the hum or [SEQ_SPLITTER]ha, these petty brands
That calumny doth use--O, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] am out--
That mercy does, for calumny will sear
V[SEQ_SPLITTER]irtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
Ere[SEQ_SPLITTER] you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
From[SEQ_SPLITTER] him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]he's an adulteress.

HERMIONE:
Should a villain sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y so,
The most replenish'd villain in the world,
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]e were as much more villain: you, my lord,
Do but [SEQ_SPLITTER]mistake.

LEONTES:
You have mistook, my lady,
Poli[SEQ_SPLITTER]xenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Which I'll not ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll a creature of thy place,
Lest barbarism, making[SEQ_SPLITTER] me the precedent,
Should a like language use to a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
She's a[SEQ_SPLITTER]n adulteress; I have said with whom:
More, she's a[SEQ_SPLITTER] traitor and Camillo is
A federary with her, and o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne that knows
What she should shame to know hersel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f
But with her most vile principal, that she's
A b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed-swerver, even as bad as those
That vulgars give[SEQ_SPLITTER] bold'st titles, ay, and privy
To this their late [SEQ_SPLITTER]escape.

HERMIONE:
No, by my life.
Privy to none o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f this. How will this grieve you,
When you shall c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome to clearer knowledge, that
You thus have publi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh'd me! Gentle my lord,
You scarce can right me t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hroughly then to say
You did mistake.

LEONTES:
No[SEQ_SPLITTER]; if I mistake
In those foundations which I build [SEQ_SPLITTER]upon,
The centre is not big enough to bear
A schoo[SEQ_SPLITTER]l-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
He who shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he spe[SEQ_SPLITTER]aks.

HERMIONE:
There's some ill planet reigns:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ct more favourable. Good my lords,
I am not prone [SEQ_SPLITTER]to weeping, as our sex
Commonly are; the want of w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hich vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities: but[SEQ_SPLITTER] I have
That honourable grief lodged here which bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rns
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rds,
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
The ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng's will be perform'd!

LEONTES:
Shall I be heard[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

HERMIONE:
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our highness,
My women may be with me; for you see[SEQ_SPLITTER]
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]here is no cause: when you shall know your mistres[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome out: this action I now go on
Is for my better [SEQ_SPLITTER]grace. Adieu, my lord:
I never wish'd to see you s[SEQ_SPLITTER]orry; now
I trust I shall. My women, come; you hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e leave.

LEONTES:
Go, do our bidding; hence!

Fir[SEQ_SPLITTER]st Lord:
Beseech your highness, call the queen aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]in.

ANTIGONUS:
Be certain what you do, sir, lest [SEQ_SPLITTER]your justice
Prove violence; in the which three gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eat ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen, your son.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]First Lord:
For her, my lord,
I dare my life lay d[SEQ_SPLITTER]own and will do't, sir,
Please you to accept it, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat the queen is spotless
I' the eyes of heaven an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d to you; I mean,
In this which you accuse her.

A[SEQ_SPLITTER]NTIGONUS:
If it prove
She's otherwise, I'll keep m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y stables where
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couple[SEQ_SPLITTER]s with her;
Than when I feel and see her no farthe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r trust her;
For every inch of woman in the world,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she [SEQ_SPLITTER]be.

LEONTES:
Hold your peaces.

First Lord:
Good [SEQ_SPLITTER]my lord,--

ANTIGONUS:
It is for you we speak, not[SEQ_SPLITTER] for ourselves:
You are abused and by some putter-[SEQ_SPLITTER]on
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the vil[SEQ_SPLITTER]lain,
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]second and the third, nine, and some five;
If this[SEQ_SPLITTER] prove true, they'll pay for't:
by mine honour,
I'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
To b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ring false generations: they are co-heirs;
And I h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad rather glib myself than they
Should not produce[SEQ_SPLITTER] fair issue.

LEONTES:
Cease; no more.
You smell t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his business with a sense as cold
As is a dead man[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s nose: but I do see't and feel't
As you feel doi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng thus; and see withal
The instruments that feel.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ANTIGONUS:
If it be so,
We need no grave to bury[SEQ_SPLITTER] honesty:
There's not a grain of it the face to sw[SEQ_SPLITTER]eeten
Of the whole dungy earth.

LEONTES:
What! la[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck I credit?

First Lord:
I had rather you did lac[SEQ_SPLITTER]k than I, my lord,
Upon this ground; and more it w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould content me
To have her honour true than your [SEQ_SPLITTER]suspicion,
Be blamed for't how you might.

LEONTES[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Why, what need we
Commune with you of this, but [SEQ_SPLITTER]rather follow
Our forceful instigation? Our prerog[SEQ_SPLITTER]ative
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]dness
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
Or [SEQ_SPLITTER]seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
Relish a t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ruth like us, inform yourselves
We need no more of[SEQ_SPLITTER] your advice: the matter,
The loss, the gain, the [SEQ_SPLITTER]ordering on't, is all
Properly ours.

ANTIGONUS:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd I wish, my liege,
You had only in your silent j[SEQ_SPLITTER]udgment tried it,
Without more overture.

LEONTES:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
How could that be?
Either thou art most ignorant [SEQ_SPLITTER]by age,
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Added to their familiarity,
Which was as gross a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s ever touch'd conjecture,
That lack'd sight only,[SEQ_SPLITTER] nought for approbation
But only seeing, all other[SEQ_SPLITTER] circumstances
Made up to the deed, doth push on t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his proceeding:
Yet, for a greater confirmation,
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or in an act of this importance 'twere
Most piteou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
To sacred [SEQ_SPLITTER]Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hom you know
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the [SEQ_SPLITTER]oracle
They will bring all; whose spiritual counse[SEQ_SPLITTER]l had,
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

F[SEQ_SPLITTER]irst Lord:
Well done, my lord.

LEONTES:
Though I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am satisfied and need no more
Than what I know, ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]t shall the oracle
Give rest to the minds of other[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, such as he
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me up to the truth. So have we thought it good
Fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m our free person she should be confined,
Lest tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her [SEQ_SPLITTER]to perform. Come, follow us;
We are to speak in pu[SEQ_SPLITTER]blic; for this business
Will raise us all.

ANTIGO[SEQ_SPLITTER]NUS:

PAULINA:
The keeper of the prison, call to h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im;
let him have knowledge who I am.
Good lady,
No[SEQ_SPLITTER] court in Europe is too good for thee;
What dost t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou then in prison?
Now, good sir,
You know me, do[SEQ_SPLITTER] you not?

Gaoler:
For a worthy lady
And one whom [SEQ_SPLITTER]much I honour.

PAULINA:
Pray you then,
Conduct me[SEQ_SPLITTER] to the queen.

Gaoler:
I may not, madam:
To the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ontrary I have express commandment.

PAULINA:
Here[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s ado,
To lock up honesty and honour from
The acc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess of gentle visitors!
Is't lawful, pray you,
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]see her women? any of them? Emilia?

Gaoler:
So pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ease you, madam,
To put apart these your attendant[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, I
Shall bring Emilia forth.

PAULINA:
I pray no[SEQ_SPLITTER]w, call her.
Withdraw yourselves.

Gaoler:
And, ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]dam,
I must be present at your conference.

PAULIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
Well, be't so, prithee.
Here's such ado to make[SEQ_SPLITTER] no stain a stain
As passes colouring.
Dear gentle[SEQ_SPLITTER]woman,
How fares our gracious lady?

EMILIA:
As we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll as one so great and so forlorn
May hold togethe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r: on her frights and griefs,
Which never tender l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ady hath born greater,
She is something before her[SEQ_SPLITTER] time deliver'd.

PAULINA:
A boy?

EMILIA:
A daugh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter, and a goodly babe,
Lusty and like to live: th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e queen receives
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor [SEQ_SPLITTER]prisoner,
I am innocent as you.'

PAULINA:
I dare [SEQ_SPLITTER]be sworn
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
beshrew them!
He must be told on't, and he shall:[SEQ_SPLITTER] the office
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon[SEQ_SPLITTER] me:
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue bliste[SEQ_SPLITTER]r
And never to my red-look'd anger be
The trumpet [SEQ_SPLITTER]any more. Pray you, Emilia,
Commend my best obedie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce to the queen:
If she dares trust me with her l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ittle babe,
I'll show't the king and undertake to [SEQ_SPLITTER]be
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
How[SEQ_SPLITTER] he may soften at the sight o' the child:
The sile[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce often of pure innocence
Persuades when speakin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g fails.

EMILIA:
Most worthy madam,
Your honour a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd your goodness is so evident
That your free unde[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtaking cannot miss
A thriving issue: there is no [SEQ_SPLITTER]lady living
So meet for this great errand. Please [SEQ_SPLITTER]your ladyship
To visit the next room, I'll present[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]o but to-day hammer'd of this design,
But durst no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t tempt a minister of honour,
Lest she should be d[SEQ_SPLITTER]enied.

PAULINA:
Tell her, Emilia.
I'll use that t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness from [SEQ_SPLITTER]my bosom, let 't not be doubted
I shall do good.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]EMILIA:
Now be you blest for it!
I'll to the queen[SEQ_SPLITTER]: please you,
come something nearer.

Gaoler:
Mada[SEQ_SPLITTER]m, if't please the queen to send the babe,
I know [SEQ_SPLITTER]not what I shall incur to pass it,
Having no warra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt.

PAULINA:
You need not fear it, sir:
This chil[SEQ_SPLITTER]d was prisoner to the womb and is
By law and proce[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss of great nature thence
Freed and enfranchised, [SEQ_SPLITTER]not a party to
The anger of the king nor guilty of[SEQ_SPLITTER],
If any be, the trespass of the queen.

Gaoler:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] do believe it.

PAULINA:
Do not you fear: upon mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne honour,
I will stand betwixt you and danger.

L[SEQ_SPLITTER]EONTES:
Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
She [SEQ_SPLITTER]the adulteress; for the harlot king
Is quite beyon[SEQ_SPLITTER]d mine arm, out of the blank
And level of my brain[SEQ_SPLITTER], plot-proof; but she
I can hook to me: say that s[SEQ_SPLITTER]he were gone,
Given to the fire, a moiety of my re[SEQ_SPLITTER]st
Might come to me again. Who's there?

First Ser[SEQ_SPLITTER]vant:
My lord?

LEONTES:
How does the boy?

First [SEQ_SPLITTER]Servant:
He took good rest to-night;
'Tis hoped hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s sickness is discharged.

LEONTES:
To see his nob[SEQ_SPLITTER]leness!
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
He[SEQ_SPLITTER] straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
Faste[SEQ_SPLITTER]n'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
Threw off[SEQ_SPLITTER] his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
And downrigh[SEQ_SPLITTER]t languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
See how he fare[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.
Fie, fie! no thought of him:
The thought of my [SEQ_SPLITTER]revenges that way
Recoil upon me: in himself too m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ighty,
And in his parties, his alliance; let him b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
Laugh at me, [SEQ_SPLITTER]make their pastime at my sorrow:
They should not l[SEQ_SPLITTER]augh if I could reach them, nor
Shall she within m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y power.

First Lord:
You must not enter.

PAULINA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
Fea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
Than the q[SEQ_SPLITTER]ueen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
More free t[SEQ_SPLITTER]han he is jealous.

ANTIGONUS:
That's enough.

Sec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ond Servant:
Madam, he hath not slept tonight; com[SEQ_SPLITTER]manded
None should come at him.

PAULINA:
Not so h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot, good sir:
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such[SEQ_SPLITTER] as you,
That creep like shadows by him and do sig[SEQ_SPLITTER]h
At each his needless heavings, such as you
Nouri[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh the cause of his awaking: I
Do come with words [SEQ_SPLITTER]as medicinal as true,
Honest as either, to purge h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im of that humour
That presses him from sleep.

LE[SEQ_SPLITTER]ONTES:
What noise there, ho?

PAULINA:
No noise, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y lord; but needful conference
About some gossips [SEQ_SPLITTER]for your highness.

LEONTES:
How!
Away with that a[SEQ_SPLITTER]udacious lady! Antigonus,
I charged thee that she [SEQ_SPLITTER]should not come about me:
I knew she would.

ANTIG[SEQ_SPLITTER]ONUS:
I told her so, my lord,
On your displeasure'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s peril and on mine,
She should not visit you.

LE[SEQ_SPLITTER]ONTES:
What, canst not rule her?

PAULINA:
From al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l dishonesty he can: in this,
Unless he take the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ourse that you have done,
Commit me for committing[SEQ_SPLITTER] honour, trust it,
He shall not rule me.

ANTIGONU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
La you now, you hear:
When she will take the re[SEQ_SPLITTER]in I let her run;
But she'll not stumble.

PAULINA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Good my liege, I come;
And, I beseech you, hear [SEQ_SPLITTER]me, who profess
Myself your loyal servant, your ph[SEQ_SPLITTER]ysician,
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that d[SEQ_SPLITTER]are
Less appear so in comforting your evils,
Than [SEQ_SPLITTER]such as most seem yours: I say, I come
From your g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood queen.

LEONTES:
Good queen!

PAULINA:
Good qu[SEQ_SPLITTER]een, my lord,
Good queen; I say good queen;
And wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld by combat make her good, so were I
A man, the [SEQ_SPLITTER]worst about you.

LEONTES:
Force her hence.

PAULI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NA:
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
Fir[SEQ_SPLITTER]st hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
But first[SEQ_SPLITTER] I'll do my errand. The good queen,
For she is goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, hath brought you forth a daughter;
Here 'tis; c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ommends it to your blessing.

LEONTES:
Out!
A mank[SEQ_SPLITTER]ind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
A most int[SEQ_SPLITTER]elligencing bawd!

PAULINA:
Not so:
I am as ignora[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt in that as you
In so entitling me, and no less [SEQ_SPLITTER]honest
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll war[SEQ_SPLITTER]rant,
As this world goes, to pass for honest.

LEO[SEQ_SPLITTER]NTES:
Traitors!
Will you not push her out? Give he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r the bastard.
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, [SEQ_SPLITTER]unroosted
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]stard;
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.

PAU[SEQ_SPLITTER]LINA:
For ever
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]akest up the princess by that forced baseness
Whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h he has put upon't!

LEONTES:
He dreads his wife.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PAULINA:
So I would you did; then 'twere past al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l doubt
You'ld call your children yours.

LEONTES:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
A nest of traitors!

ANTIGONUS:
I am none, by thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s good light.

PAULINA:
Nor I, nor any
But one tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t's here, and that's himself, for he
The sacred ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]nour of himself, his queen's,
His hopeful son's, h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is babe's, betrays to slander,
Whose sting is shar[SEQ_SPLITTER]per than the sword's;
and will not--
For, as the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ase now stands, it is a curse
He cannot be compell[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d to't--once remove
The root of his opinion, whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h is rotten
As ever oak or stone was sound.

LEONT[SEQ_SPLITTER]ES:
A callat
Of boundless tongue, who late hath be[SEQ_SPLITTER]at her husband
And now baits me! This brat is none[SEQ_SPLITTER] of mine;
It is the issue of Polixenes:
Hence with[SEQ_SPLITTER] it, and together with the dam
Commit them to the [SEQ_SPLITTER]fire!

PAULINA:
It is yours;
And, might we lay the[SEQ_SPLITTER] old proverb to your charge,
So like you, 'tis the[SEQ_SPLITTER] worse. Behold, my lords,
Although the print be li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ttle, the whole matter
And copy of the father, eye[SEQ_SPLITTER], nose, lip,
The trick of's frown, his forehead, n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, the valley,
The pretty dimples of his chin and[SEQ_SPLITTER] cheek,
His smiles,
The very mould and frame of ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, nail, finger:
And thou, good goddess Nature, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hich hast made it
So like to him that got it, if t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou hast
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all[SEQ_SPLITTER] colours
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he d[SEQ_SPLITTER]oes,
Her children not her husband's!

LEONTES:
A g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ross hag
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That wilt not stay her tongue.

ANTIGONUS:
Hang a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll the husbands
That cannot do that feat, you'll l[SEQ_SPLITTER]eave yourself
Hardly one subject.

LEONTES:
Once m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore, take her hence.

PAULINA:
A most unworthy and[SEQ_SPLITTER] unnatural lord
Can do no more.

LEONTES:
I'll ha'[SEQ_SPLITTER] thee burnt.

PAULINA:
I care not:
It is an hereti[SEQ_SPLITTER]c that makes the fire,
Not she which burns in't. I[SEQ_SPLITTER]'ll not call you tyrant;
But this most cruel usage[SEQ_SPLITTER] of your queen,
Not able to produce more accusatio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
Yea, scan[SEQ_SPLITTER]dalous to the world.

LEONTES:
On your allegiance,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
Whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]re were her life? she durst not call me so,
If she[SEQ_SPLITTER] did know me one. Away with her!

PAULINA:
I pray [SEQ_SPLITTER]you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
Look to your ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]be, my lord; 'tis yours:
Jove send her
A better gu[SEQ_SPLITTER]iding spirit! What needs these hands?
You, that ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e thus so tender o'er his follies,
Will never do h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im good, not one of you.
So, so: farewell; we are [SEQ_SPLITTER]gone.

LEONTES:
Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wif[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to this.
My child? away with't! Even thou, that [SEQ_SPLITTER]hast
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]see it instantly consumed with fire;
Even thou and[SEQ_SPLITTER] none but thou. Take it up straight:
Within this h[SEQ_SPLITTER]our bring me word 'tis done,
And by good testimony[SEQ_SPLITTER], or I'll seize thy life,
With what thou else call[SEQ_SPLITTER]'st thine. If thou refuse
And wilt encounter with [SEQ_SPLITTER]my wrath, say so;
The bastard brains with these my[SEQ_SPLITTER] proper hands
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the[SEQ_SPLITTER] fire;
For thou set'st on thy wife.

ANTIGONUS:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]did not, sir:
These lords, my noble fellows, if th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey please,
Can clear me in't.

Lords:
We can: my r[SEQ_SPLITTER]oyal liege,
He is not guilty of her coming hither.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

LEONTES:
You're liars all.

First Lord:
Beseech [SEQ_SPLITTER]your highness, give us better credit:
We have alwa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ys truly served you, and beseech you
So to esteem [SEQ_SPLITTER]of us, and on our knees we beg,
As recompense of o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur dear services
Past and to come, that you do cha[SEQ_SPLITTER]nge this purpose,
Which being so horrible, so bloo[SEQ_SPLITTER]dy, must
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

LEONTES:
I am a feather for each wind that blows[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
And ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll me father? better burn it now
Than curse it the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n. But be it; let it live.
It shall not neither. Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou, sir, come you hither;
You that have been so te[SEQ_SPLITTER]nderly officious
With Lady Margery, your midwife t[SEQ_SPLITTER]here,
To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bas[SEQ_SPLITTER]tard,
So sure as this beard's grey,
--what will yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u adventure
To save this brat's life?

ANTIGONUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Any thing, my lord,
That my ability may undergo
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d nobleness impose: at least thus much:
I'll pawn [SEQ_SPLITTER]the little blood which I have left
To save the inn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ocent: any thing possible.

LEONTES:
It shall be p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ossible. Swear by this sword
Thou wilt perform my [SEQ_SPLITTER]bidding.

ANTIGONUS:
I will, my lord.

LEONTES:
Ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]rk and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
Of an[SEQ_SPLITTER]y point in't shall not only be
Death to thyself bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t to thy lewd-tongued wife,
Whom for this time we [SEQ_SPLITTER]pardon. We enjoin thee,
As thou art liege-man to u[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, that thou carry
This female bastard hence and t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat thou bear it
To some remote and desert place q[SEQ_SPLITTER]uite out
Of our dominions, and that there thou lea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve it,
Without more mercy, to its own protection
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
It[SEQ_SPLITTER] came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
On thy s[SEQ_SPLITTER]oul's peril and thy body's torture,
That thou comm[SEQ_SPLITTER]end it strangely to some place
Where chance may nu[SEQ_SPLITTER]rse or end it. Take it up.

ANTIGONUS:
I swear to [SEQ_SPLITTER]do this, though a present death
Had been more merc[SEQ_SPLITTER]iful. Come on, poor babe:
Some powerful spirit ins[SEQ_SPLITTER]truct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses! Wolve[SEQ_SPLITTER]s and bears, they say
Casting their savageness asi[SEQ_SPLITTER]de have done
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosper[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous
In more than this deed does require! And bless[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
Poor t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hing, condemn'd to loss!

LEONTES:
No, I'll not re[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar
Another's issue.

Servant:
Please your highness[SEQ_SPLITTER], posts
From those you sent to the oracle are come[SEQ_SPLITTER]
An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,
Being well arr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ived from Delphos, are both landed,
Hasting to the[SEQ_SPLITTER] court.

First Lord:
So please you, sir, their spe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed
Hath been beyond account.

LEONTES:
Twenty-thre[SEQ_SPLITTER]e days
They have been absent: 'tis good speed; for[SEQ_SPLITTER]etells
The great Apollo suddenly will have
The tru[SEQ_SPLITTER]th of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
Summon a se[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssion, that we may arraign
Our most disloyal lady,[SEQ_SPLITTER] for, as she hath
Been publicly accused, so shall [SEQ_SPLITTER]she have
A just and open trial. While she lives
My[SEQ_SPLITTER] heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
And thin[SEQ_SPLITTER]k upon my bidding.

CLEOMENES:
The climate's delic[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate, the air most sweet,
Fertile the isle, the tem[SEQ_SPLITTER]ple much surpassing
The common praise it bears.

D[SEQ_SPLITTER]ION:
I shall report,
For most it caught me, the ce[SEQ_SPLITTER]lestial habits,
Methinks I so should term them, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d the reverence
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacri[SEQ_SPLITTER]fice!
How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
It was[SEQ_SPLITTER] i' the offering!

CLEOMENES:
But of all, the burs[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
Kin t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
That I wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s nothing.

DION:
If the event o' the journey
Prov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--
As it [SEQ_SPLITTER]hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
The time i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s worth the use on't.

CLEOMENES:
Great Apollo
Tur[SEQ_SPLITTER]n all to the best! These proclamations,
So forcing[SEQ_SPLITTER] faults upon Hermione,
I little like.

DION:
The v[SEQ_SPLITTER]iolent carriage of it
Will clear or end the busine[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss: when the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's great divine[SEQ_SPLITTER] seal'd up,
Shall the contents discover, something[SEQ_SPLITTER] rare
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh [SEQ_SPLITTER]horses!
And gracious be the issue!

LEONTES:
This [SEQ_SPLITTER]sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
Even pu[SEQ_SPLITTER]shes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
The daught[SEQ_SPLITTER]er of a king, our wife, and one
Of us too much bel[SEQ_SPLITTER]oved. Let us be clear'd
Of being tyrannous, since [SEQ_SPLITTER]we so openly
Proceed in justice, which shall have [SEQ_SPLITTER]due course,
Even to the guilt or the purgation.
Pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]oduce the prisoner.

Officer:
It is his highness' [SEQ_SPLITTER]pleasure that the queen
Appear in person here in c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ourt. Silence!

LEONTES:
Read the indictment.

Off[SEQ_SPLITTER]icer:

HERMIONE:
Since what I am to say must be bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The tes[SEQ_SPLITTER]timony on my part no other
But what comes from mys[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf, it shall scarce boot me
To say 'not guilty:' [SEQ_SPLITTER]mine integrity
Being counted falsehood, shall, as [SEQ_SPLITTER]I express it,
Be so received. But thus: if powers [SEQ_SPLITTER]divine
Behold our human actions, as they do,
I dou[SEQ_SPLITTER]bt not then but innocence shall make
False accusat[SEQ_SPLITTER]ion blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience. You, my[SEQ_SPLITTER] lord, best know,
Who least will seem to do so, my[SEQ_SPLITTER] past life
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as t[SEQ_SPLITTER]rue,
As I am now unhappy; which is more
Than histo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry can pattern, though devised
And play'd to take [SEQ_SPLITTER]spectators. For behold me
A fellow of the royal be[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, which owe
A moiety of the throne a great king's[SEQ_SPLITTER] daughter,
The mother to a hopeful prince, here st[SEQ_SPLITTER]anding
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it[SEQ_SPLITTER]
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour[SEQ_SPLITTER],
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
And only that[SEQ_SPLITTER] I stand for. I appeal
To your own conscience, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER], before Polixenes
Came to your court, how I was i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
With what encounter so uncurrent I
Have strain'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]to appear thus: if one jot beyond
The bound of hon[SEQ_SPLITTER]our, or in act or will
That way inclining, harden'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d be the hearts
Of all that hear me, and my near's[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of kin
Cry fie upon my grave!

LEONTES:
I ne'er [SEQ_SPLITTER]heard yet
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Le[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss impudence to gainsay what they did
Than to perf[SEQ_SPLITTER]orm it first.

HERMIONE:
That's true enough;
Throu[SEQ_SPLITTER]gh 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

LEONTES:
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u will not own it.

HERMIONE:
More than mistress o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]t all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
With whom I am a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ccused, I do confess
I loved him as in honour he r[SEQ_SPLITTER]equired,
With such a kind of love as might become
[SEQ_SPLITTER]A lady like me, with a love even such,
So and no o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther, as yourself commanded:
Which not to have don[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I think had been in me
Both disobedience and ing[SEQ_SPLITTER]ratitude
To you and toward your friend, whose love[SEQ_SPLITTER] had spoke,
Even since it could speak, from an inf[SEQ_SPLITTER]ant, freely
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy[SEQ_SPLITTER],
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
Fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r me to try how: all I know of it
Is that Camillo [SEQ_SPLITTER]was an honest man;
And why he left your court, the[SEQ_SPLITTER] gods themselves,
Wotting no more than I, are igno[SEQ_SPLITTER]rant.

LEONTES:
You knew of his departure, as you [SEQ_SPLITTER]know
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
HERMIONE:
Sir,
You speak a language that I unders[SEQ_SPLITTER]tand not:
My life stands in the level of your drea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ms,
Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES:
Your actions ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e my dreams;
You had a bastard by Polixenes,
And I[SEQ_SPLITTER] but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
Tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]se of your fact are so--so past all truth:
Which t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o deny concerns more than avails; for as
Thy brat [SEQ_SPLITTER]hath been cast out, like to itself,
No father owni[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng it,--which is, indeed,
More criminal in thee th[SEQ_SPLITTER]an it,--so thou
Shalt feel our justice, in whose e[SEQ_SPLITTER]asiest passage
Look for no less than death.

HERMI[SEQ_SPLITTER]ONE:
Sir, spare your threats:
The bug which you wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld fright me with I seek.
To me can life be no co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mmodity:
The crown and comfort of my life, your fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]vour,
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
But k[SEQ_SPLITTER]now not how it went. My second joy
And first-fruit[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of my body, from his presence
I am barr'd, like [SEQ_SPLITTER]one infectious. My third comfort
Starr'd most unlu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ckily, is from my breast,
The innocent milk in its[SEQ_SPLITTER] most innocent mouth,
Haled out to murder: myself [SEQ_SPLITTER]on every post
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest[SEQ_SPLITTER] hatred
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'lon[SEQ_SPLITTER]gs
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o this place, i' the open air, before
I have got s[SEQ_SPLITTER]trength of limit. Now, my liege,
Tell me what bles[SEQ_SPLITTER]sings I have here alive,
That I should fear to die[SEQ_SPLITTER]? Therefore proceed.
But yet hear this: mistake me[SEQ_SPLITTER] not; no life,
I prize it not a straw, but for min[SEQ_SPLITTER]e honour,
Which I would free, if I shall be condem[SEQ_SPLITTER]n'd
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
But wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at your jealousies awake, I tell you
'Tis rigor an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d not law. Your honours all,
I do refer me to the [SEQ_SPLITTER]oracle:
Apollo be my judge!

First Lord:
This your[SEQ_SPLITTER] request
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth[SEQ_SPLITTER],
And in Apollos name, his oracle.

HERMIONE:
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]Emperor of Russia was my father:
O that he were al[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive, and here beholding
His daughter's trial! that[SEQ_SPLITTER] he did but see
The flatness of my misery, yet wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h eyes
Of pity, not revenge!

Officer:
You here sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all swear upon this sword of justice,
That you, Cl[SEQ_SPLITTER]eomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom thence have brought
The seal'd-up oracle, by t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he hand deliver'd
Of great Apollo's priest; and th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at, since then,
You have not dared to break the ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly seal
Nor read the secrets in't.

CLEOMENES:
All[SEQ_SPLITTER] this we swear.

LEONTES:
Break up the seals and r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ead.

Officer:

Lords:
Now blessed be the great Ap[SEQ_SPLITTER]ollo!

HERMIONE:
Praised!

LEONTES:
Hast thou read[SEQ_SPLITTER] truth?

Officer:
Ay, my lord; even so
As it is he[SEQ_SPLITTER]re set down.

LEONTES:
There is no truth at all i'[SEQ_SPLITTER] the oracle:
The sessions shall proceed: this is m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere falsehood.

Servant:
My lord the king, the kin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g!

LEONTES:
What is the business?

Servant:
O sir[SEQ_SPLITTER], I shall be hated to report it!
The prince your s[SEQ_SPLITTER]on, with mere conceit and fear
Of the queen's spee[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, is gone.

LEONTES:
How! gone!

Servant:
Is dead[SEQ_SPLITTER].

LEONTES:
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themse[SEQ_SPLITTER]lves
Do strike at my injustice.
How now there!

PA[SEQ_SPLITTER]ULINA:
This news is mortal to the queen: look down[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And see what death is doing.

LEONTES:
Take her h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ence:
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recov[SEQ_SPLITTER]er:
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]eseech you, tenderly apply to her
Some remedies fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r life.
Apollo, pardon
My great profaneness 'gains[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thine oracle!
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
Ne[SEQ_SPLITTER]w woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
Whom I pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]oclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
For, being transp[SEQ_SPLITTER]orted by my jealousies
To bloody thoughts and to r[SEQ_SPLITTER]evenge, I chose
Camillo for the minister to poison[SEQ_SPLITTER]
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
But tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift comman[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, though I with death and with
Reward did threate[SEQ_SPLITTER]n and encourage him,
Not doing 't and being done: [SEQ_SPLITTER]he, most humane
And fill'd with honour, to my king[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly guest
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes [SEQ_SPLITTER]here,
Which you knew great, and to the hazard
Of a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll encertainties himself commended,
No richer than[SEQ_SPLITTER] his honour: how he glisters
Thorough my rust! and[SEQ_SPLITTER] how his pity
Does my deeds make the blacker!

PAU[SEQ_SPLITTER]LINA:
Woe the while!
O, cut my lace, lest my heart[SEQ_SPLITTER], cracking it,
Break too.

First Lord:
What fit is[SEQ_SPLITTER] this, good lady?

PAULINA:
What studied torments,[SEQ_SPLITTER] tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels? racks? fires? w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat flaying? boiling?
In leads or oils? what old o[SEQ_SPLITTER]r newer torture
Must I receive, whose every word d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eserves
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
To[SEQ_SPLITTER]gether working with thy jealousies,
Fancies too we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine,[SEQ_SPLITTER] O, think what they have done
And then run mad ind[SEQ_SPLITTER]eed, stark mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleries were[SEQ_SPLITTER] but spices of it.
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,[SEQ_SPLITTER]'twas nothing;
That did but show thee, of a fool, [SEQ_SPLITTER]inconstant
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour[SEQ_SPLITTER],
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
More m[SEQ_SPLITTER]onstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
The casting[SEQ_SPLITTER] forth to crows thy baby-daughter
To be or none or[SEQ_SPLITTER] little; though a devil
Would have shed water out [SEQ_SPLITTER]of fire ere done't:
Nor is't directly laid to thee[SEQ_SPLITTER], the death
Of the young prince, whose honourable [SEQ_SPLITTER]thoughts,
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he heart
That could conceive a gross and foolish s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ire
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
L[SEQ_SPLITTER]aid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
When I [SEQ_SPLITTER]have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
The sw[SEQ_SPLITTER]eet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
and vengeance for[SEQ_SPLITTER]'t
Not dropp'd down yet.

First Lord:
The higher p[SEQ_SPLITTER]owers forbid!

PAULINA:
I say she's dead; I'll swe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if[SEQ_SPLITTER] you can bring
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her [SEQ_SPLITTER]eye,
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
Do [SEQ_SPLITTER]not repent these things, for they are heavier
Than[SEQ_SPLITTER] all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
To n[SEQ_SPLITTER]othing but despair. A thousand knees
Ten thousand [SEQ_SPLITTER]years together, naked, fasting,
Upon a barren moun[SEQ_SPLITTER]tain and still winter
In storm perpetual, could no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t move the gods
To look that way thou wert.

LEONT[SEQ_SPLITTER]ES:
Go on, go on
Thou canst not speak too much; I [SEQ_SPLITTER]have deserved
All tongues to talk their bitterest.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

First Lord:
Say no more:
Howe'er the business go[SEQ_SPLITTER]es, you have made fault
I' the boldness of your sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]eech.

PAULINA:
I am sorry for't:
All faults I mak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, when I shall come to know them,
I do repent. Al[SEQ_SPLITTER]as! I have show'd too much
The rashness of a woman[SEQ_SPLITTER]: he is touch'd
To the noble heart. What's gone an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d what's past help
Should be past grief: do not re[SEQ_SPLITTER]ceive affliction
At my petition; I beseech you, ra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
Of w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat you should forget. Now, good my liege
Sir, roy[SEQ_SPLITTER]al sir, forgive a foolish woman:
The love I bore y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our queen--lo, fool again!--
I'll speak of her no [SEQ_SPLITTER]more, nor of your children;
I'll not remember you [SEQ_SPLITTER]of my own lord,
Who is lost too: take your patienc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to you,
And I'll say nothing.

LEONTES:
Thou did[SEQ_SPLITTER]st speak but well
When most the truth; which I rec[SEQ_SPLITTER]eive much better
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithe[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, bring me
To the dead bodies of my queen and son[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] causes of their death appear, unto
Our shame perp[SEQ_SPLITTER]etual. Once a day I'll visit
The chapel where they[SEQ_SPLITTER] lie, and tears shed there
Shall be my recreation:[SEQ_SPLITTER] so long as nature
Will bear up with this exercise[SEQ_SPLITTER], so long
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Unto these sorrows.

ANTIGONUS:
Thou art perfect t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Boh[SEQ_SPLITTER]emia?

Mariner:
Ay, my lord: and fear
We have land[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed in ill time: the skies look grimly
And threaten[SEQ_SPLITTER] present blusters. In my conscience,
The heavens w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith that we have in hand are angry
And frown upon [SEQ_SPLITTER]'s.

ANTIGONUS:
Their sacred wills be done! Go, ge[SEQ_SPLITTER]t aboard;
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long befor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
I call upon thee.

Mariner:
Make your best haste[SEQ_SPLITTER], and go not
Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be [SEQ_SPLITTER]loud weather;
Besides, this place is famous for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e creatures
Of prey that keep upon't.

ANTIGONUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Go thou away:
I'll follow instantly.

Mariner:
I a[SEQ_SPLITTER]m glad at heart
To be so rid o' the business.

ANT[SEQ_SPLITTER]IGONUS:
Come, poor babe:
I have heard, but not bel[SEQ_SPLITTER]ieved,
the spirits o' the dead
May walk again: if [SEQ_SPLITTER]such thing be, thy mother
Appear'd to me last nigh[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, for ne'er was dream
So like a waking. To me com[SEQ_SPLITTER]es a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, som[SEQ_SPLITTER]e another;
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
So[SEQ_SPLITTER] fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
Like[SEQ_SPLITTER] very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I [SEQ_SPLITTER]lay; thrice bow'd before me,
And gasping to begin [SEQ_SPLITTER]some speech, her eyes
Became two spouts: the fury [SEQ_SPLITTER]spent, anon
Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigon[SEQ_SPLITTER]us,
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor [SEQ_SPLITTER]babe, according to thine oath,
Places remote enoug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h are in Bohemia,
There weep and leave it crying; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and, for the babe
Is counted lost for ever, Perdit[SEQ_SPLITTER]a,
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
Thy wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
She melted [SEQ_SPLITTER]into air. Affrighted much,
I did in time collect m[SEQ_SPLITTER]yself and thought
This was so and no slumber. Drea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ms are toys:
Yet for this once, yea, superstitious[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly,
I will be squared by this. I do believe
Hermio[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne hath suffer'd death, and that
Apollo would, thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s being indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes, it sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld here be laid,
Either for life or death, upon t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he earth
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee [SEQ_SPLITTER]well!
There lie, and there thy character: there th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ese;
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee[SEQ_SPLITTER], pretty,
And still rest thine. The storm begins; [SEQ_SPLITTER]poor wretch,
That for thy mother's fault art thus [SEQ_SPLITTER]exposed
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot[SEQ_SPLITTER],
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
To b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
The day frow[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns more and more: thou'rt like to have
A lullaby t[SEQ_SPLITTER]oo rough: I never saw
The heavens so dim by day. A[SEQ_SPLITTER] savage clamour!
Well may I get aboard! This is th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e chase:
I am gone for ever.

Shepherd:
I would th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere were no age between sixteen and
three-and-twen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty, or that youth would sleep out the
rest; for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere is nothing in the between but
getting wenches [SEQ_SPLITTER]with child, wronging the ancientry,
stealing, figh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ting--Hark you now! Would any but
these boiled bra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ins of nineteen and two-and-twenty
hunt this weath[SEQ_SPLITTER]er? They have scared away two of my
best sheep, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich I fear the wolf will sooner find
than the mast[SEQ_SPLITTER]er: if any where I have them, 'tis by
the seaside,[SEQ_SPLITTER] browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
will what[SEQ_SPLITTER] have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
pretty [SEQ_SPLITTER]barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
pretty one; a[SEQ_SPLITTER] very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
though I am n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot bookish, yet I can read
waiting-gentlewoman in [SEQ_SPLITTER]the 'scape. This has been
some stair-work, some tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]unk-work, some
behind-door-work: they were warmer [SEQ_SPLITTER]that got this
than the poor thing is here. I'll ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke it up for
pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come[SEQ_SPLITTER]; he hallooed
but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!

Clown:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Hilloa, loa!

Shepherd:
What, art so near? If tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u'lt see a thing to talk
on when thou art dead and[SEQ_SPLITTER] rotten, come hither. What
ailest thou, man?

Clow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n:
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land[SEQ_SPLITTER]!
but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he
sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot th[SEQ_SPLITTER]rust
a bodkin's point.

Shepherd:
Why, boy, how is[SEQ_SPLITTER] it?

Clown:
I would you did but see how it chafes[SEQ_SPLITTER], how it rages,
how it takes up the shore! but tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t's not the
point. O, the most piteous cry of the [SEQ_SPLITTER]poor souls!
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see '[SEQ_SPLITTER]em; now the
ship boring the moon with her main-mas[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, and anon
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld thrust a
cork into a hogshead. And then for the[SEQ_SPLITTER]
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]oulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
[SEQ_SPLITTER]his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an[SEQ_SPLITTER]
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned[SEQ_SPLITTER]
it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roar[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder th[SEQ_SPLITTER]an
the sea or weather.

Shepherd:
Name of mercy, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen was this, boy?

Clown:
Now, now: I have not wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nked since I saw these
sights: the men are not yet[SEQ_SPLITTER] cold under water, nor
the bear half dined on the [SEQ_SPLITTER]gentleman: he's at it
now.

Shepherd:
Would I had [SEQ_SPLITTER]been by, to have helped the old man!

Clown:
I wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld you had been by the ship side, to have
helped h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er: there your charity would have lacked footing.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Shepherd:
Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee here,
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th things
dying, I with things newborn. Here's a s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight for
thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a sq[SEQ_SPLITTER]uire's
child! look thee here; take up, take up, bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]y;
open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should [SEQ_SPLITTER]be
rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
o[SEQ_SPLITTER]pen't. What's within, boy?

Clown:
You're a made o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld man: if the sins of your youth
are forgiven you[SEQ_SPLITTER], you're well to live. Gold! all gold!

Shepherd:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
We[SEQ_SPLITTER] are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
nothi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
boy, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he next way home.

Clown:
Go you the next way with[SEQ_SPLITTER] your findings. I'll go see
if the bear be gone fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om the gentleman and how much
he hath eaten: they [SEQ_SPLITTER]are never curst but when they
are hungry: if there[SEQ_SPLITTER] be any of him left, I'll bury
it.

Shepherd:
That[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
sigh[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of him.

Clown:
Marry, will I; and you shall hel[SEQ_SPLITTER]p to put him i' the ground.

Shepherd:
'Tis a luck[SEQ_SPLITTER]y day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.

Time:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER], that please some, try all, both joy and terror
O[SEQ_SPLITTER]f good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
Now [SEQ_SPLITTER]take upon me, in the name of Time,
To use my wings[SEQ_SPLITTER]. Impute it not a crime
To me or my swift passage,[SEQ_SPLITTER] that I slide
O'er sixteen years and leave the gro[SEQ_SPLITTER]wth untried
Of that wide gap, since it is in my po[SEQ_SPLITTER]wer
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
The same I[SEQ_SPLITTER] am, ere ancient'st order was
Or what is now recei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ved: I witness to
The times that brought them in; [SEQ_SPLITTER]so shall I do
To the freshest things now reigning [SEQ_SPLITTER]and make stale
The glistering of this present, as [SEQ_SPLITTER]my tale
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng,
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing[SEQ_SPLITTER]
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
The ef[SEQ_SPLITTER]fects of his fond jealousies so grieving
That he s[SEQ_SPLITTER]huts up himself, imagine me,
Gentle spectators, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at I now may be
In fair Bohemia, and remember well[SEQ_SPLITTER],
I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I now name to you; and with speed so pace
To speak[SEQ_SPLITTER] of Perdita, now grown in grace
Equal with wonderi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng: what of her ensues
I list not prophecy; but le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Time's news
Be known when 'tis brought forth.
A [SEQ_SPLITTER]shepherd's daughter,
And what to her adheres, whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h follows after,
Is the argument of Time. Of this [SEQ_SPLITTER]allow,
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]If never, yet that Time himself doth say
He wishes[SEQ_SPLITTER] earnestly you never may.

POLIXENES:
I pray thee,[SEQ_SPLITTER] good Camillo, be no more importunate:
'tis a sick[SEQ_SPLITTER]ness denying thee any thing; a death to
grant this[SEQ_SPLITTER].

CAMILLO:
It is fifteen years since I saw my cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntry: though
I have for the most part been aired a[SEQ_SPLITTER]broad, I
desire to lay my bones there. Besides, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e penitent
king, my master, hath sent for me; to w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hose feeling
sorrows I might be some allay, or I o[SEQ_SPLITTER]'erween to
think so, which is another spur to my d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eparture.

POLIXENES:
As thou lovest me, Camillo, [SEQ_SPLITTER]wipe not out the rest of
thy services by leaving m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e now: the need I have of
thee thine own goodness [SEQ_SPLITTER]hath made; better not to
have had thee than thus t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o want thee: thou, having
made me businesses which[SEQ_SPLITTER] none without thee can
sufficiently manage, must e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ither stay to execute
them thyself or take away wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th thee the very
services thou hast done; which if[SEQ_SPLITTER] I have not enough
considered, as too much I canno[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, to be more
thankful to thee shall be my study, [SEQ_SPLITTER]and my profit
therein the heaping friendships. Of [SEQ_SPLITTER]that fatal
country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more[SEQ_SPLITTER]; whose very
naming punishes me with the remembran[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce of that
penitent, as thou callest him, and reco[SEQ_SPLITTER]nciled king,
my brother; whose loss of his most pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ecious queen
and children are even now to be afres[SEQ_SPLITTER]h lamented.
Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince[SEQ_SPLITTER] Florizel, my
son? Kings are no less unhappy, thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r issue not
being gracious, than they are in losin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g them when
they have approved their virtues.

CAM[SEQ_SPLITTER]ILLO:
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince[SEQ_SPLITTER]. What
his happier affairs may be, are to me unkno[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn: but I
have missingly noted, he is of late much[SEQ_SPLITTER] retired
from court and is less frequent to his pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]incely
exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]POLIXENES:
I have considered so much, Camillo, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] with some
care; so far that I have eyes under my [SEQ_SPLITTER]service which
look upon his removedness; from whom[SEQ_SPLITTER] I have this
intelligence, that he is seldom from [SEQ_SPLITTER]the house of a
most homely shepherd; a man, they s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, that from
very nothing, and beyond the imagina[SEQ_SPLITTER]tion of his
neighbours, is grown into an unspeakab[SEQ_SPLITTER]le estate.

CAMILLO:
I have heard, sir, of such a [SEQ_SPLITTER]man, who hath a
daughter of most rare note: the re[SEQ_SPLITTER]port of her is
extended more than can be thought t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o begin from such a cottage.

POLIXENES:
That's li[SEQ_SPLITTER]kewise part of my intelligence; but, I
fear, the a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngle that plucks our son thither. Thou
shalt accom[SEQ_SPLITTER]pany us to the place; where we will, not
appearing[SEQ_SPLITTER] what we are, have some question with the
shepherd[SEQ_SPLITTER]; from whose simplicity I think it not
uneasy to g[SEQ_SPLITTER]et the cause of my son's resort thither.
Prithee, [SEQ_SPLITTER]be my present partner in this business, and
lay as[SEQ_SPLITTER]ide the thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I willingly[SEQ_SPLITTER] obey your command.

POLIXENES:
My best Camillo! W[SEQ_SPLITTER]e must disguise ourselves.

AUTOLYCUS:
When daffod[SEQ_SPLITTER]ils begin to peer,
With heigh! the doxy over the d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ale,
Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
The wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ite sheet bleaching on the hedge,
With heigh! the [SEQ_SPLITTER]sweet birds, O, how they sing!
Doth set my pugging[SEQ_SPLITTER] tooth on edge;
For a quart of ale is a dish for a[SEQ_SPLITTER] king.
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
With heig[SEQ_SPLITTER]h! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
Are summer [SEQ_SPLITTER]songs for me and my aunts,
While we lie tumbling i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the hay.
I have served Prince Florizel and in my[SEQ_SPLITTER] time
wore three-pile; but now I am out of service[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
The pale[SEQ_SPLITTER] moon shines by night:
And when I wander here and [SEQ_SPLITTER]there,
I then do most go right.
If tinkers may hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e leave to live,
And bear the sow-skin budget,
The[SEQ_SPLITTER]n my account I well may, give,
And in the stocks a[SEQ_SPLITTER]vouch it.
My traffic is sheets; when the kite buil[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds, look to
lesser linen. My father named me Autol[SEQ_SPLITTER]ycus; who
being, as I am, littered under Mercury, [SEQ_SPLITTER]was likewise
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.[SEQ_SPLITTER] With die and
drab I purchased this caparison, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] my revenue is
the silly cheat. Gallows and knock [SEQ_SPLITTER]are too powerful
on the highway: beating and hangi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng are terrors to
me: for the life to come, I slee[SEQ_SPLITTER]p out the thought
of it. A prize! a prize!

Clown:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
shor[SEQ_SPLITTER]n. what comes the wool to?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
I c[SEQ_SPLITTER]annot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
[SEQ_SPLITTER]of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will[SEQ_SPLITTER]
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or
the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very [SEQ_SPLITTER]good
ones; but they are most of them means and bas[SEQ_SPLITTER]es; but
one puritan amongst them, and he sings psa[SEQ_SPLITTER]lms to
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he warden
pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of [SEQ_SPLITTER]my note;
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, [SEQ_SPLITTER]but that I
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as m[SEQ_SPLITTER]any of
raisins o' the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
O that ever[SEQ_SPLITTER] I was born!

Clown:
I' the name of me--

AUTOLYCU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and
then, death, death!

Clown:
Alack, poor soul! [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou hast need of more rags to lay
on thee, rather[SEQ_SPLITTER] than have these off.

AUTOLYCUS:
O sir, the loath[SEQ_SPLITTER]someness of them offends me more
than the stripes [SEQ_SPLITTER]I have received, which are mighty
ones and million[SEQ_SPLITTER]s.

Clown:
Alas, poor man! a million of beating ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y come to a
great matter.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am robbed,[SEQ_SPLITTER] sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
ta'en from [SEQ_SPLITTER]me, and these detestable things put upon
me.

Clow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n:
What, by a horseman, or a footman?

AUTOLYCUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]A footman, sweet sir, a footman.

Clown:
Indeed, h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e should be a footman by the garments he
has left [SEQ_SPLITTER]with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
it hath s[SEQ_SPLITTER]een very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
I'll help [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee: come, lend me thy hand.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir, tenderly, O!

Clown:
Alas, poor soul!

AUTOLY[SEQ_SPLITTER]CUS:
O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
shoulder-blade is out.

Clown:
How now! canst st[SEQ_SPLITTER]and?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Dost lack any money? I ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve a little money for thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good s[SEQ_SPLITTER]weet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
a kinsman[SEQ_SPLITTER] not past three quarters of a mile hence,
unto who[SEQ_SPLITTER]m I was going; I shall there have money, or
any th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;
that ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]lls my heart.

Clown:
What manner of fellow was he[SEQ_SPLITTER] that robbed you?

AUTOLYCUS:
A fellow, sir, that [SEQ_SPLITTER]I have known to go about with
troll-my-dames; I kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ew him once a servant of the
prince: I cannot tell[SEQ_SPLITTER], good sir, for which of his
virtues it was, but h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e was certainly whipped out of the court.

Clown:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whippe[SEQ_SPLITTER]d
out of the court: they cherish it to make it sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
there; and yet it will no more but abide.

AUTOL[SEQ_SPLITTER]YCUS:
Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l: he
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
proces[SEQ_SPLITTER]s-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
motion of[SEQ_SPLITTER] the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
wife wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hin a mile where my land and living lies;
and, hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing flown over many knavish professions, he
settle[SEQ_SPLITTER]d only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.

Clown:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
w[SEQ_SPLITTER]akes, fairs and bear-baitings.

AUTOLYCUS:
Very tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
put me[SEQ_SPLITTER] into this apparel.

Clown:
Not a more cowardly ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]gue in all Bohemia: if you had
but looked big and [SEQ_SPLITTER]spit at him, he'ld have run.

AUTOLYCUS:
I must co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nfess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
false of [SEQ_SPLITTER]heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
him.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Clown:
How do you now?

AUTOLYCUS:
Sweet sir, much[SEQ_SPLITTER] better than I was; I can stand and
walk: I will e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ven take my leave of you, and pace
softly towards [SEQ_SPLITTER]my kinsman's.

Clown:
Shall I bring thee on the wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y?

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Clown:
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices [SEQ_SPLITTER]for our
sheep-shearing.

AUTOLYCUS:
Prosper you, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]weet sir!
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase[SEQ_SPLITTER] your spice.
I'll be with you at your sheep-sheari[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng too: if I
make not this cheat bring out another[SEQ_SPLITTER] and the
shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled [SEQ_SPLITTER]and my name
put in the book of virtue!
Jog on, jog[SEQ_SPLITTER] on, the foot-path way,
And merrily hent the stile[SEQ_SPLITTER]-a:
A merry heart goes all the day,
Your sad tires[SEQ_SPLITTER] in a mile-a.

FLORIZEL:
These your unusual weeds [SEQ_SPLITTER]to each part of you
Do give a life: no shepherdess[SEQ_SPLITTER], but Flora
Peering in April's front. This your sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]eep-shearing
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d you the queen on't.

PERDITA:
Sir, my gracious l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord,
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
The g[SEQ_SPLITTER]racious mark o' the land, you have obscured
With a[SEQ_SPLITTER] swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
Most go[SEQ_SPLITTER]ddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
In ever[SEQ_SPLITTER]y mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a[SEQ_SPLITTER] custom, I should blush
To see you so attired, swo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rn, I think,
To show myself a glass.

FLORIZEL:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]bless the time
When my good falcon made her flight[SEQ_SPLITTER] across
Thy father's ground.

PERDITA:
Now Jove af[SEQ_SPLITTER]ford you cause!
To me the difference forges dread;[SEQ_SPLITTER] your greatness
Hath not been used to fear. Even n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow I tremble
To think your father, by some acciden[SEQ_SPLITTER]t,
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]How would he look, to see his work so noble
Vilely[SEQ_SPLITTER] bound up? What would he say? Or how
Should I, in [SEQ_SPLITTER]these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
The sternness of[SEQ_SPLITTER] his presence?

FLORIZEL:
Apprehend
Nothing but jo[SEQ_SPLITTER]llity. The gods themselves,
Humbling their deities[SEQ_SPLITTER] to love, have taken
The shapes of beasts upon the[SEQ_SPLITTER]m: Jupiter
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green [SEQ_SPLITTER]Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
As I seem no[SEQ_SPLITTER]w. Their transformations
Were never for a piece of[SEQ_SPLITTER] beauty rarer,
Nor in a way so chaste, since my de[SEQ_SPLITTER]sires
Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
Bur[SEQ_SPLITTER]n hotter than my faith.

PERDITA:
O, but, sir,
You[SEQ_SPLITTER]r resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
Opposed, as it[SEQ_SPLITTER] must be, by the power of the king:
One of these t[SEQ_SPLITTER]wo must be necessities,
Which then will speak, tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t you must
change this purpose,
Or I my life.

FLO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RIZEL:
Thou dearest Perdita,
With these forced tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ughts, I prithee, darken not
The mirth o' the feas[SEQ_SPLITTER]t. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
Or not my father's. [SEQ_SPLITTER]For I cannot be
Mine own, nor any thing to any, if[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
Thoug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
Strangle such [SEQ_SPLITTER]thoughts as these with any thing
That you behold t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he while. Your guests are coming:
Lift up your cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntenance, as it were the day
Of celebration of tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t nuptial which
We two have sworn shall come.

PER[SEQ_SPLITTER]DITA:
O lady Fortune,
Stand you auspicious!

FLORI[SEQ_SPLITTER]ZEL:
See, your guests approach:
Address yourself t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o entertain them sprightly,
And let's be red with [SEQ_SPLITTER]mirth.

Shepherd:
Fie, daughter! when my old wife [SEQ_SPLITTER]lived, upon
This day she was both pantler, butler,[SEQ_SPLITTER] cook,
Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served[SEQ_SPLITTER] all;
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now [SEQ_SPLITTER]here,
At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle[SEQ_SPLITTER];
On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
With [SEQ_SPLITTER]labour and the thing she took to quench it,
She wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld to each one sip. You are retired,
As if you we[SEQ_SPLITTER]re a feasted one and not
The hostess of the meetin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g: pray you, bid
These unknown friends to's welcom[SEQ_SPLITTER]e; for it is
A way to make us better friends, more[SEQ_SPLITTER] known.
Come, quench your blushes and present your[SEQ_SPLITTER]self
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me on,
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]As your good flock shall prosper.

PERDITA:

POLIX[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENES:
Shepherdess,
A fair one are you--well you fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]t our ages
With flowers of winter.

PERDITA:
Sir, [SEQ_SPLITTER]the year growing ancient,
Not yet on summer's deat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h, nor on the birth
Of trembling winter, the faire[SEQ_SPLITTER]st
flowers o' the season
Are our carnations and st[SEQ_SPLITTER]reak'd gillyvors,
Which some call nature's bastard[SEQ_SPLITTER]s: of that kind
Our rustic garden's barren; and I [SEQ_SPLITTER]care not
To get slips of them.

POLIXENES:
Wherefo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re, gentle maiden,
Do you neglect them?

PERDITA:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]For I have heard it said
There is an art which in [SEQ_SPLITTER]their piedness shares
With great creating nature.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
POLIXENES:
Say there be;
Yet nature is made bette[SEQ_SPLITTER]r by no mean
But nature makes that mean: so, over [SEQ_SPLITTER]that art
Which you say adds to nature, is an art
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
A [SEQ_SPLITTER]gentler scion to the wildest stock,
And make conce[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler race: th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is is an art
Which does mend nature, change it rat[SEQ_SPLITTER]her, but
The art itself is nature.

PERDITA:
So it[SEQ_SPLITTER] is.

POLIXENES:
Then make your garden rich in gil[SEQ_SPLITTER]lyvors,
And do not call them bastards.

PERDITA:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]'ll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of[SEQ_SPLITTER] them;
No more than were I painted I would wish
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is youth should say 'twere well and only therefore[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]t lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
The marigold[SEQ_SPLITTER], that goes to bed wi' the sun
And with him rises [SEQ_SPLITTER]weeping: these are flowers
Of middle summer, and I[SEQ_SPLITTER] think they are given
To men of middle age. You're[SEQ_SPLITTER] very welcome.

CAMILLO:
I should leave grazing, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere I of your flock,
And only live by gazing.

PER[SEQ_SPLITTER]DITA:
Out, alas!
You'd be so lean, that blasts of [SEQ_SPLITTER]January
Would blow you through and through.
Now, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y fair'st friend,
I would I had some flowers o' th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e spring that might
Become your time of day; and y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ours, and yours,
That wear upon your virgin branch[SEQ_SPLITTER]es yet
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom Dis's waggon! daffodils,
That come before the [SEQ_SPLITTER]swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with be[SEQ_SPLITTER]auty; violets dim,
But sweeter than the lids of Ju[SEQ_SPLITTER]no's eyes
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t die unmarried, ere they can behold
Bight Phoebus[SEQ_SPLITTER] in his strength--a malady
Most incident to maids;[SEQ_SPLITTER] bold oxlips and
The crown imperial; lilies of all[SEQ_SPLITTER] kinds,
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ack,
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To strew him o'er and o'er!

FLORIZEL:
What, like[SEQ_SPLITTER] a corse?

PERDITA:
No, like a bank for love to li[SEQ_SPLITTER]e and play on;
Not like a corse; or if, not to be [SEQ_SPLITTER]buried,
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r flowers:
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
[SEQ_SPLITTER]In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does [SEQ_SPLITTER]change my disposition.

FLORIZEL:
What you do
Stil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
I'l[SEQ_SPLITTER]d have you do it ever: when you sing,
I'ld have yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u buy and sell so, so give alms,
Pray so; and, for[SEQ_SPLITTER] the ordering your affairs,
To sing them too: when[SEQ_SPLITTER] you do dance, I wish you
A wave o' the sea, that [SEQ_SPLITTER]you might ever do
Nothing but that; move still, st[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill so,
And own no other function: each your doing[SEQ_SPLITTER],
So singular in each particular,
Crowns what you [SEQ_SPLITTER]are doing in the present deed,
That all your acts [SEQ_SPLITTER]are queens.

PERDITA:
O Doricles,
Your praises are[SEQ_SPLITTER] too large: but that your youth,
And the true bloo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d which peepeth fairly through't,
Do plainly give [SEQ_SPLITTER]you out an unstain'd shepherd,
With wisdom I might[SEQ_SPLITTER] fear, my Doricles,
You woo'd me the false way.

F[SEQ_SPLITTER]LORIZEL:
I think you have
As little skill to fear [SEQ_SPLITTER]as I have purpose
To put you to't. But come; our d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ance, I pray:
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir,
That never mean to part.

PERDITA:
I'll swear [SEQ_SPLITTER]for 'em.

POLIXENES:
This is the prettiest low-bor[SEQ_SPLITTER]n lass that ever
Ran on the green-sward: nothing s[SEQ_SPLITTER]he does or seems
But smacks of something greater t[SEQ_SPLITTER]han herself,
Too noble for this place.

CAMILLO:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]e tells her something
That makes her blood look ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t: good sooth, she is
The queen of curds and cream[SEQ_SPLITTER].

Clown:
Come on, strike up!

DORCAS:
Mopsa must [SEQ_SPLITTER]be your mistress: marry, garlic,
To mend her kissi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng with!

MOPSA:
Now, in good time!

Clown:
Not a [SEQ_SPLITTER]word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
Come, str[SEQ_SPLITTER]ike up!

POLIXENES:
Pray, good shepherd, what fair[SEQ_SPLITTER] swain is this
Which dances with your daughter?

S[SEQ_SPLITTER]hepherd:
They call him Doricles; and boasts himsel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
Upon his[SEQ_SPLITTER] own report and I believe it;
He looks like sooth.[SEQ_SPLITTER] He says he loves my daughter:
I think so too; for[SEQ_SPLITTER] never gazed the moon
Upon the water as he'll stan[SEQ_SPLITTER]d and read
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e plain.
I think there is not half a kiss to choos[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Who loves another best.

POLIXENES:
She dances f[SEQ_SPLITTER]eatly.

Shepherd:
So she does any thing; though I [SEQ_SPLITTER]report it,
That should be silent: if young Doricle[SEQ_SPLITTER]s
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
Whic[SEQ_SPLITTER]h he not dreams of.

Servant:
O master, if you did[SEQ_SPLITTER] but hear the pedlar at the
door, you would never [SEQ_SPLITTER]dance again after a tabour and
pipe; no, the bagpi[SEQ_SPLITTER]pe could not move you: he sings
several tunes fast[SEQ_SPLITTER]er than you'll tell money; he
utters them as he ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]d eaten ballads and all men's
ears grew to his tun[SEQ_SPLITTER]es.

Clown:
He could never come better; he shall c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome in. I
love a ballad but even too well, if it b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e doleful
matter merrily set down, or a very pleas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ant thing
indeed and sung lamentably.

Servant:
He[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
mil[SEQ_SPLITTER]liner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
has[SEQ_SPLITTER] the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]wdry, which is strange; with such delicate
burthen[SEQ_SPLITTER]s of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
her;'[SEQ_SPLITTER] and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
as i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith
'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'

POLIXENES:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]This is a brave fellow.

Clown:
Believe me, thou t[SEQ_SPLITTER]alkest of an admirable conceited
fellow. Has he an[SEQ_SPLITTER]y unbraided wares?

Servant:
He hath ribbons of an[SEQ_SPLITTER] the colours i' the rainbow;
points more than all [SEQ_SPLITTER]the lawyers in Bohemia can
learnedly handle, thoug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h they come to him by the
gross: inkles, caddisses[SEQ_SPLITTER], cambrics, lawns: why, he
sings 'em over as they [SEQ_SPLITTER]were gods or goddesses; you
would think a smock we[SEQ_SPLITTER]re a she-angel, he so chants
to the sleeve-hand an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d the work about the square on't.

Clown:
Prithee [SEQ_SPLITTER]bring him in; and let him approach singing.

PERDI[SEQ_SPLITTER]TA:
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n 's tunes.

Clown:
You have of these pedlars, tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t have more in them
than you'ld think, sister.

PE[SEQ_SPLITTER]RDITA:
Ay, good brother, or go about to think.

AU[SEQ_SPLITTER]TOLYCUS:
Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus blac[SEQ_SPLITTER]k as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask rose[SEQ_SPLITTER]s;
Masks for faces and for noses;
Bugle bracelet, [SEQ_SPLITTER]necklace amber,
Perfume for a lady's chamber;
Gold[SEQ_SPLITTER]en quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give thei[SEQ_SPLITTER]r dears:
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
What mai[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds lack from head to heel:
Come buy of me, come; c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome buy, come buy;
Buy lads, or else your lasses c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry: Come buy.

Clown:
If I were not in love with M[SEQ_SPLITTER]opsa, thou shouldst take
no money of me; but being[SEQ_SPLITTER] enthralled as I am, it
will also be the bondage o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f certain ribbons and gloves.

MOPSA:
I was promis[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed them against the feast; but they come
not too l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate now.

DORCAS:
He hath promised you more than t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat, or there be liars.

MOPSA:
He hath paid you a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll he promised you; may be, he has
paid you more, [SEQ_SPLITTER]which will shame you to give him again.

Clown:
Is[SEQ_SPLITTER] there no manners left among maids? will they
wear[SEQ_SPLITTER] their plackets where they should bear their
faces[SEQ_SPLITTER]? Is there not milking-time, when you are
going to[SEQ_SPLITTER] bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, [SEQ_SPLITTER]but you must be tittle-tattling before all
our gue[SEQ_SPLITTER]sts? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
your t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ongues, and not a word more.

MOPSA:
I have done. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
and a pair of [SEQ_SPLITTER]sweet gloves.

Clown:
Have I not told thee how I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]as cozened by the way
and lost all my money?

AUTO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LYCUS:
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
therefore it behoves men to be wary.

Clown:
Fear[SEQ_SPLITTER] not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.

AUT[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLYCUS:
I hope so, sir; for I have about me many p[SEQ_SPLITTER]arcels of charge.

Clown:
What hast here? ballads?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

MOPSA:
Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]int o'
life, for then we are sure they are true.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]AUTOLYCUS:
Here's one to a very doleful tune, how [SEQ_SPLITTER]a usurer's
wife was brought to bed of twenty money[SEQ_SPLITTER]-bags at a
burthen and how she longed to eat adder[SEQ_SPLITTER]s' heads and
toads carbonadoed.

MOPSA:
Is it true[SEQ_SPLITTER], think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, and but a mont[SEQ_SPLITTER]h old.

DORCAS:
Bless me from marrying a usurer!

[SEQ_SPLITTER]AUTOLYCUS:
Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mis[SEQ_SPLITTER]tress
Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at were
present. Why should I carry lies abroad?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MOPSA:
Pray you now, buy it.

Clown:
Come on, lay [SEQ_SPLITTER]it by: and let's first see moe
ballads; we'll buy [SEQ_SPLITTER]the other things anon.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's another [SEQ_SPLITTER]ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
the coast on [SEQ_SPLITTER]Wednesday the four-score of April,
forty thousand [SEQ_SPLITTER]fathom above water, and sung this
ballad against t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he hard hearts of maids: it was
thought she was a [SEQ_SPLITTER]woman and was turned into a cold
fish for she woul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d not exchange flesh with one that
loved her: the [SEQ_SPLITTER]ballad is very pitiful and as true.

DORCAS:
Is it[SEQ_SPLITTER] true too, think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Five justices' h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ands at it, and witnesses more than
my pack will h[SEQ_SPLITTER]old.

Clown:
Lay it by too: another.

AUTOLYCUS:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]his is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.

MOP[SEQ_SPLITTER]SA:
Let's have some merry ones.

AUTOLYCUS:
Why, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his is a passing merry one and goes to
the tune of[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
scarce a maid w[SEQ_SPLITTER]estward but she sings it; 'tis in
request, I can t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell you.

MOPSA:
We can both sing it: if thou'lt b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ear a part, thou
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
DORCAS:
We had the tune on't a month ago.

AUTOLY[SEQ_SPLITTER]CUS:
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
occ[SEQ_SPLITTER]upation; have at it with you.

AUTOLYCUS:
Get you [SEQ_SPLITTER]hence, for I must go
Where it fits not you to know[SEQ_SPLITTER].

DORCAS:
Whither?

MOPSA:
O, whither?

DORCAS:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hither?

MOPSA:
It becomes thy oath full well,
Tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u to me thy secrets tell.

DORCAS:
Me too, let me [SEQ_SPLITTER]go thither.

MOPSA:
Or thou goest to the orange or[SEQ_SPLITTER] mill.

DORCAS:
If to either, thou dost ill.

AUTO[SEQ_SPLITTER]LYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
What, neither?

AUTOLYCUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Neither.

DORCAS:
Thou hast sworn my love to be.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

MOPSA:
Thou hast sworn it more to me:
Then whith[SEQ_SPLITTER]er goest? say, whither?

Clown:
We'll have this so[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng out anon by ourselves: my
father and the gentle[SEQ_SPLITTER]men are in sad talk, and we'll
not trouble them. C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome, bring away thy pack after
me. Wenches, I'll b[SEQ_SPLITTER]uy for you both. Pedlar, let's
have the first choi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce. Follow me, girls.

AUTOLYCUS:
And you shall pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y well for 'em.
Will you buy any tape,
Or lace for[SEQ_SPLITTER] your cape,
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ny thread,
Any toys for your head,
Of the new'st a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd finest, finest wear-a?
Come to the pedlar;
Mone[SEQ_SPLITTER]y's a medler.
That doth utter all men's ware-a.

S[SEQ_SPLITTER]ervant:
Master, there is three carters, three shep[SEQ_SPLITTER]herds,
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave made
themselves all men of hair, they call the[SEQ_SPLITTER]mselves
Saltiers, and they have a dance which the [SEQ_SPLITTER]wenches
say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hey are
not in't; but they themselves are o' the m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ind, if it
be not too rough for some that know lit[SEQ_SPLITTER]tle but
bowling, it will please plentifully.

Shep[SEQ_SPLITTER]herd:
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou.

POLIXENES:
You weary those that refresh us: p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ray, let's see
these four threes of herdsmen.

Ser[SEQ_SPLITTER]vant:
One three of them, by their own report, sir,[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath
danced before the king; and not the worst of[SEQ_SPLITTER] the
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the[SEQ_SPLITTER] squier.

Shepherd:
Leave your prating: since thes[SEQ_SPLITTER]e good men are
pleased, let them come in; but quic[SEQ_SPLITTER]kly now.

Servant:
Why, they stay at door, sir.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]OLIXENES:
O, father, you'll know more of that here[SEQ_SPLITTER]after.
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hem.
He's simple and tells much.
How now, fair she[SEQ_SPLITTER]pherd!
Your heart is full of something that does t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was you[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng
And handed love as you do, I was wont
To load m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
The pedl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
To her acc[SEQ_SPLITTER]eptance; you have let him go
And nothing marted wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th him. If your lass
Interpretation should abuse a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd call this
Your lack of love or bounty, you were[SEQ_SPLITTER] straited
For a reply, at least if you make a care[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Of happy holding her.

FLORIZEL:
Old sir, I know
[SEQ_SPLITTER]She prizes not such trifles as these are:
The gift[SEQ_SPLITTER]s she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
Up in my[SEQ_SPLITTER] heart; which I have given already,
But not delive[SEQ_SPLITTER]r'd. O, hear me breathe my life
Before this ancien[SEQ_SPLITTER]t sir, who, it should seem,
Hath sometime loved! I[SEQ_SPLITTER] take thy hand, this hand,
As soft as dove's down [SEQ_SPLITTER]and as white as it,
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ann'd
snow that's bolted
By the northern blasts tw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice o'er.

POLIXENES:
What follows this?
How prett[SEQ_SPLITTER]ily the young swain seems to wash
The hand was fai[SEQ_SPLITTER]r before! I have put you out:
But to your protesta[SEQ_SPLITTER]tion; let me hear
What you profess.

FLORIZEL:
Do,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and be witness to 't.

POLIXENES:
And this my nei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghbour too?

FLORIZEL:
And he, and more
Than he, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
That, wer[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
Thereof mos[SEQ_SPLITTER]t worthy, were I the fairest youth
That ever made [SEQ_SPLITTER]eye swerve, had force and knowledge
More than was [SEQ_SPLITTER]ever man's, I would not prize them
Without her lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e; for her employ them all;
Commend them and conde[SEQ_SPLITTER]mn them to her service
Or to their own perdition.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
POLIXENES:
Fairly offer'd.

CAMILLO:
This shows a[SEQ_SPLITTER] sound affection.

Shepherd:
But, my daughter,
Say[SEQ_SPLITTER] you the like to him?

PERDITA:
I cannot speak
So [SEQ_SPLITTER]well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
By the[SEQ_SPLITTER] pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
The purity[SEQ_SPLITTER] of his.

Shepherd:
Take hands, a bargain!
And, fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
I giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e my daughter to him, and will make
Her portion eq[SEQ_SPLITTER]ual his.

FLORIZEL:
O, that must be
I' the virtue [SEQ_SPLITTER]of your daughter: one being dead,
I shall have mor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for your [SEQ_SPLITTER]wonder. But, come on,
Contract us 'fore these witn[SEQ_SPLITTER]esses.

Shepherd:
Come, your hand;
And, daughter, [SEQ_SPLITTER]yours.

POLIXENES:
Soft, swain, awhile, beseech yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u;
Have you a father?

FLORIZEL:
I have: but what [SEQ_SPLITTER]of him?

POLIXENES:
Knows he of this?

FLORIZEL:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]e neither does nor shall.

POLIXENES:
Methinks a f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
That be[SEQ_SPLITTER]st becomes the table. Pray you once more,
Is not y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our father grown incapable
Of reasonable affairs? [SEQ_SPLITTER]is he not stupid
With age and altering rheums? can[SEQ_SPLITTER] he speak? hear?
Know man from man? dispute his ow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does noth[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing
But what he did being childish?

FLORIZEL:
No,[SEQ_SPLITTER] good sir;
He has his health and ampler strength i[SEQ_SPLITTER]ndeed
Than most have of his age.

POLIXENES:
By my[SEQ_SPLITTER] white beard,
You offer him, if this be so, a wron[SEQ_SPLITTER]g
Something unfilial: reason my son
Should choose [SEQ_SPLITTER]himself a wife, but as good reason
The father, all[SEQ_SPLITTER] whose joy is nothing else
But fair posterity, sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld hold some counsel
In such a business.

FLORIZE[SEQ_SPLITTER]L:
I yield all this;
But for some other reasons, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y grave sir,
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not ac[SEQ_SPLITTER]quaint
My father of this business.

POLIXENES:
Let[SEQ_SPLITTER] him know't.

FLORIZEL:
He shall not.

POLIXENES:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Prithee, let him.

FLORIZEL:
No, he must not.

She[SEQ_SPLITTER]pherd:
Let him, my son: he shall not need to griev[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
At knowing of thy choice.

FLORIZEL:
Come, come,[SEQ_SPLITTER] he must not.
Mark our contract.

POLIXENES:
Mark [SEQ_SPLITTER]your divorce, young sir,
Whom son I dare not call;[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou art too base
To be acknowledged: thou a scep[SEQ_SPLITTER]tre's heir,
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] old traitor,
I am sorry that by hanging thee I ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh p[SEQ_SPLITTER]iece
Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow
The royal fool thou copest with,--

Shepherd:
O[SEQ_SPLITTER], my heart!

POLIXENES:
I'll have thy beauty scrat[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch'd with briers, and made
More homely than thy st[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate. For thee, fond boy,
If I may ever know thou d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ost but sigh
That thou no more shalt see this knac[SEQ_SPLITTER]k, as never
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from[SEQ_SPLITTER] succession;
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur kin,
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this tim[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
That mak[SEQ_SPLITTER]es himself, but for our honour therein,
Unworthy t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee,--if ever henceforth thou
These rural latches [SEQ_SPLITTER]to his entrance open,
Or hoop his body more with t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy embraces,
I will devise a death as cruel for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee
As thou art tender to't.

PERDITA:
Even here un[SEQ_SPLITTER]done!
I was not much afeard; for once or twice
I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]as about to speak and tell him plainly,
The selfsa[SEQ_SPLITTER]me sun that shines upon his court
Hides not his vi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sage from our cottage but
Looks on alike. Will't p[SEQ_SPLITTER]lease you, sir, be gone?
I told you what would com[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of this: beseech you,
Of your own state take car[SEQ_SPLITTER]e: this dream of mine,--
Being now awake, I'll que[SEQ_SPLITTER]en it no inch farther,
But milk my ewes and weep.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
CAMILLO:
Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou die[SEQ_SPLITTER]st.

Shepherd:
I cannot speak, nor think
Nor dare [SEQ_SPLITTER]to know that which I know. O sir!
You have undone [SEQ_SPLITTER]a man of fourscore three,
That thought to fill his[SEQ_SPLITTER] grave in quiet, yea,
To die upon the bed my fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r died,
To lie close by his honest bones: but now
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
Wher[SEQ_SPLITTER]e no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] knew'st this was the prince,
and wouldst adventur[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
If I m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight die within this hour, I have lived
To die whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]n I desire.

FLORIZEL:
Why look you so upon me?
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing alt[SEQ_SPLITTER]er'd: what I was, I am;
More straining on for pluc[SEQ_SPLITTER]king back, not following
My leash unwillingly.

CA[SEQ_SPLITTER]MILLO:
Gracious my lord,
You know your father's te[SEQ_SPLITTER]mper: at this time
He will allow no speech, which [SEQ_SPLITTER]I do guess
You do not purpose to him; and as hardl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
Then, [SEQ_SPLITTER]till the fury of his highness settle,
Come not bef[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore him.

FLORIZEL:
I not purpose it.
I think, Cam[SEQ_SPLITTER]illo?

CAMILLO:
Even he, my lord.

PERDITA:
How of[SEQ_SPLITTER]ten have I told you 'twould be thus!
How often sai[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, my dignity would last
But till 'twere known!

F[SEQ_SPLITTER]LORIZEL:
It cannot fail but by
The violation of my[SEQ_SPLITTER] faith; and then
Let nature crush the sides o' the[SEQ_SPLITTER] earth together
And mar the seeds within! Lift up [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy looks:
From my succession wipe me, father; I
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]m heir to my affection.

CAMILLO:
Be advised.

FLO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RIZEL:
I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
Will th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ereto be obedient, I have reason;
If not, my sense[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, better pleased with madness,
Do bid it welcome.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

CAMILLO:
This is desperate, sir.

FLORIZEL:
So c[SEQ_SPLITTER]all it: but it does fulfil my vow;
I needs must th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ink it honesty. Camillo,
Not for Bohemia, nor the [SEQ_SPLITTER]pomp that may
Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun [SEQ_SPLITTER]sees or
The close earth wombs or the profound sea [SEQ_SPLITTER]hides
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
As yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
When[SEQ_SPLITTER] he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
To se[SEQ_SPLITTER]e him any more,--cast your good counsels
Upon his [SEQ_SPLITTER]passion; let myself and fortune
Tug for the time t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o come. This you may know
And so deliver, I am put[SEQ_SPLITTER] to sea
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And most opportune to our need I have
A vessel ri[SEQ_SPLITTER]des fast by, but not prepared
For this design. Wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t course I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your[SEQ_SPLITTER] knowledge, nor
Concern me the reporting.

CAMILLO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
O my lord!
I would your spirit were easier for a[SEQ_SPLITTER]dvice,
Or stronger for your need.

FLORIZEL:
Hark,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Perdita
I'll hear you by and by.

CAMILLO:
He's i[SEQ_SPLITTER]rremoveable,
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy[SEQ_SPLITTER], if
His going I could frame to serve my turn,
Sav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e him from danger, do him love and honour,
Purchas[SEQ_SPLITTER]e the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy[SEQ_SPLITTER] king, my master, whom
I so much thirst to see.

F[SEQ_SPLITTER]LORIZEL:
Now, good Camillo;
I am so fraught with c[SEQ_SPLITTER]urious business that
I leave out ceremony.

CAMILL[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
Sir, I think
You have heard of my poor services[SEQ_SPLITTER], i' the love
That I have borne your father?

FLOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]IZEL:
Very nobly
Have you deserved: it is my fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's music
To speak your deeds, not little of his c[SEQ_SPLITTER]are
To have them recompensed as thought on.

CAMIL[SEQ_SPLITTER]LO:
Well, my lord,
If you may please to think I lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve the king
And through him what is nearest to him[SEQ_SPLITTER], which is
Your gracious self, embrace but my dire[SEQ_SPLITTER]ction:
If your more ponderous and settled project
[SEQ_SPLITTER]May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
I'll point [SEQ_SPLITTER]you where you shall have such receiving
As shall b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ecome your highness; where you may
Enjoy your mist[SEQ_SPLITTER]ress, from the whom, I see,
There's no disjunction[SEQ_SPLITTER] to be made, but by--
As heavens forefend!--your r[SEQ_SPLITTER]uin; marry her,
And, with my best endeavours in yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur absence,
Your discontenting father strive to qu[SEQ_SPLITTER]alify
And bring him up to liking.

FLORIZEL:
How, [SEQ_SPLITTER]Camillo,
May this, almost a miracle, be done?
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] I may call thee something more than man
And after[SEQ_SPLITTER] that trust to thee.

CAMILLO:
Have you thought on[SEQ_SPLITTER]
A place whereto you'll go?

FLORIZEL:
Not any yet[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to be the[SEQ_SPLITTER] slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ws.

CAMILLO:
Then list to me:
This follows, if yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u will not change your purpose
But undergo this fl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight, make for Sicilia,
And there present yourself[SEQ_SPLITTER] and your fair princess,
For so I see she must be,[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'fore Leontes:
She shall be habited as it becomes[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
Leontes o[SEQ_SPLITTER]pening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes fort[SEQ_SPLITTER]h; asks thee the son forgiveness,
As 'twere i' the[SEQ_SPLITTER] father's person; kisses the hands
Of your fresh p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rincess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ndness and his kindness; the one
He chides to hell[SEQ_SPLITTER] and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]me.

FLORIZEL:
Worthy Camillo,
What colour for my [SEQ_SPLITTER]visitation shall I
Hold up before him?

CAMILLO:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent by the king your father
To greet him and to gi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve him comforts. Sir,
The manner of your bearing t[SEQ_SPLITTER]owards him, with
What you as from your father shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l deliver,
Things known betwixt us three, I'll wri[SEQ_SPLITTER]te you down:
The which shall point you forth at ev[SEQ_SPLITTER]ery sitting
What you must say; that he shall not p[SEQ_SPLITTER]erceive
But that you have your father's bosom ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
And speak his very heart.

FLORIZEL:
I am bound [SEQ_SPLITTER]to you:
There is some sap in this.

CAMILLO:
A cau[SEQ_SPLITTER]se more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourse[SEQ_SPLITTER]lves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most ce[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtain
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] as you shake off one to take another;
Nothing so [SEQ_SPLITTER]certain as your anchors, who
Do their best office,[SEQ_SPLITTER] if they can but stay you
Where you'll be loath to[SEQ_SPLITTER] be: besides you know
Prosperity's the very bond o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f love,
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart tog[SEQ_SPLITTER]ether
Affliction alters.

PERDITA:
One of these is[SEQ_SPLITTER] true:
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t not take in the mind.

CAMILLO:
Yea, say you so?[SEQ_SPLITTER]
There shall not at your father's house these
seve[SEQ_SPLITTER]n years
Be born another such.

FLORIZEL:
My good C[SEQ_SPLITTER]amillo,
She is as forward of her breeding as
She i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s i' the rear our birth.

CAMILLO:
I cannot say 't[SEQ_SPLITTER]is pity
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]stress
To most that teach.

PERDITA:
Your pardon, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir; for this
I'll blush you thanks.

FLORIZEL:
My[SEQ_SPLITTER] prettiest Perdita!
But O, the thorns we stand upo[SEQ_SPLITTER]n! Camillo,
Preserver of my father, now of me,
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] medicine of our house, how shall we do?
We are no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
Nor shall appear i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Fear none of this: I[SEQ_SPLITTER] think you know my fortunes
Do all lie there: it s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall be so my care
To have you royally appointed a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s if
The scene you play were mine. For instance, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir,
That you may know you shall not want, one word[SEQ_SPLITTER].

AUTOLYCUS:
Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and [SEQ_SPLITTER]Trust, his
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman![SEQ_SPLITTER] I have sold
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit st[SEQ_SPLITTER]one, not a
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-[SEQ_SPLITTER]book, ballad,
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracel[SEQ_SPLITTER]et, horn-ring,
to keep my pack from fasting: they [SEQ_SPLITTER]throng who
should buy first, as if my trinkets had[SEQ_SPLITTER] been
hallowed and brought a benediction to the bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]yer:
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
[SEQ_SPLITTER]picture; and what I saw, to my good use I
remember[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed. My clown, who wants but something to
be a reas[SEQ_SPLITTER]onable man, grew so in love with the
wenches' song[SEQ_SPLITTER], that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had[SEQ_SPLITTER] both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e herd to me that all their other senses
stuck in [SEQ_SPLITTER]ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
was sen[SEQ_SPLITTER]seless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purs[SEQ_SPLITTER]e; I could have filed keys off that hung in
chains[SEQ_SPLITTER]: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
and a[SEQ_SPLITTER]dmiring the nothing of it. So that in this
time of[SEQ_SPLITTER] lethargy I picked and cut most of their
festival [SEQ_SPLITTER]purses; and had not the old man come in
with a who[SEQ_SPLITTER]o-bub against his daughter and the king's
son and [SEQ_SPLITTER]scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
left a[SEQ_SPLITTER] purse alive in the whole army.

CAMILLO:
Nay, but[SEQ_SPLITTER] my letters, by this means being there
So soon as [SEQ_SPLITTER]you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

FLORIZEL:
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] those that you'll procure from King Leontes--

CA[SEQ_SPLITTER]MILLO:
Shall satisfy your father.

PERDITA:
Happy [SEQ_SPLITTER]be you!
All that you speak shows fair.

CAMILLO:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ho have we here?
We'll make an instrument of this,[SEQ_SPLITTER] omit
Nothing may give us aid.

AUTOLYCUS:
If they[SEQ_SPLITTER] have overheard me now, why, hanging.

CAMILLO:
Ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
not,[SEQ_SPLITTER] man; here's no harm intended to thee.

AUTOLYCUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I am a poor fellow, sir.

CAMILLO:
Why, be so sti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll; here's nobody will steal that from
thee: yet f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or the outside of thy poverty we must
make an exch[SEQ_SPLITTER]ange; therefore discase thee instantly,
--thou mus[SEQ_SPLITTER]t think there's a necessity in't,--and
change garm[SEQ_SPLITTER]ents with this gentleman: though the
pennyworth on[SEQ_SPLITTER] his side be the worst, yet hold thee,
there's som[SEQ_SPLITTER]e boot.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.
I kno[SEQ_SPLITTER]w ye well enough.

CAMILLO:
Nay, prithee, dispatch[SEQ_SPLITTER]: the gentleman is half
flayed already.

AUTOLYCUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Are you in earnest, sir?
I smell the trick on't.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

FLORIZEL:
Dispatch, I prithee.

AUTOLYCUS:
Indee[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
conscienc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e take it.

CAMILLO:
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
Fortunate[SEQ_SPLITTER] mistress,--let my prophecy
Come home to ye!--you [SEQ_SPLITTER]must retire yourself
Into some covert: take your s[SEQ_SPLITTER]weetheart's hat
And pluck it o'er your brows, muff[SEQ_SPLITTER]le your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disl[SEQ_SPLITTER]iken
The truth of your own seeming; that you may--[SEQ_SPLITTER]
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ied.

PERDITA:
I see the play so lies
That I must [SEQ_SPLITTER]bear a part.

CAMILLO:
No remedy.
Have you done th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere?

FLORIZEL:
Should I now meet my father,
He wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld not call me son.

CAMILLO:
Nay, you shall have[SEQ_SPLITTER] no hat.
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.

A[SEQ_SPLITTER]UTOLYCUS:
Adieu, sir.

FLORIZEL:
O Perdita, what h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave we twain forgot!
Pray you, a word.

CAMILLO:

[SEQ_SPLITTER]FLORIZEL:
Fortune speed us!
Thus we set on, Camill[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, to the sea-side.

CAMILLO:
The swifter speed th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e better.

AUTOLYCUS:
I understand the business, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] hear it: to have an
open ear, a quick eye, and a [SEQ_SPLITTER]nimble hand, is
necessary for a cut-purse; a good [SEQ_SPLITTER]nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the [SEQ_SPLITTER]other senses. I see
this is the time that the unju[SEQ_SPLITTER]st man doth thrive.
What an exchange had this been[SEQ_SPLITTER] without boot! What
a boot is here with this excha[SEQ_SPLITTER]nge! Sure the gods do
this year connive at us, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] we may do any thing
extempore. The prince himself[SEQ_SPLITTER] is about a piece of
iniquity, stealing away from [SEQ_SPLITTER]his father with his
clog at his heels: if I though[SEQ_SPLITTER]t it were a piece of
honesty to acquaint the king [SEQ_SPLITTER]withal, I would not
do't: I hold it the more knave[SEQ_SPLITTER]ry to conceal it;
and therein am I constant to my [SEQ_SPLITTER]profession.
Aside, aside; here is more matter for [SEQ_SPLITTER]a hot brain:
every lane's end, every shop, church,[SEQ_SPLITTER] session,
hanging, yields a careful man work.

Clo[SEQ_SPLITTER]wn:
See, see; what a man you are now!
There is no [SEQ_SPLITTER]other way but to tell the king
she's a changeling [SEQ_SPLITTER]and none of your flesh and blood.

Shepherd:
Nay, [SEQ_SPLITTER]but hear me.

Clown:
Nay, but hear me.

Shepherd:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Go to, then.

Clown:
She being none of your flesh [SEQ_SPLITTER]and blood, your flesh
and blood has not offended t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he king; and so your
flesh and blood is not to be [SEQ_SPLITTER]punished by him. Show
those things you found about[SEQ_SPLITTER] her, those secret
things, all but what she has wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th her: this being
done, let the law go whistle: I[SEQ_SPLITTER] warrant you.

Shepherd:
I will tell the king all,[SEQ_SPLITTER] every word, yea, and his
son's pranks too; who, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] may say, is no honest man,
neither to his father [SEQ_SPLITTER]nor to me, to go about to make
me the king's broth[SEQ_SPLITTER]er-in-law.

Clown:
Indeed, brother-in-law was the [SEQ_SPLITTER]farthest off you
could have been to him and then y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our blood had been
the dearer by I know how much a[SEQ_SPLITTER]n ounce.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
Well, let us to th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e king: there is that in this
fardel will make him[SEQ_SPLITTER] scratch his beard.

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Pray heart[SEQ_SPLITTER]ily he be at palace.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
To the[SEQ_SPLITTER] palace, an it like your worship.

AUTOLYCUS:
Your[SEQ_SPLITTER] affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
of [SEQ_SPLITTER]that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
name[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing that is fitting to be known, discover.

Clown:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
We are but plain fellows, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
A lie;[SEQ_SPLITTER] you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
lying: it[SEQ_SPLITTER] becomes none but tradesmen, and they
often give u[SEQ_SPLITTER]s soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
it with st[SEQ_SPLITTER]amped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
they do [SEQ_SPLITTER]not give us the lie.

Clown:
Your worship had like[SEQ_SPLITTER] to have given us one, if you
had not taken yourse[SEQ_SPLITTER]lf with the manner.

Shepherd:
Are you a courtier,[SEQ_SPLITTER] an't like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Whether it like m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e or no, I am a courtier. Seest
thou not the air o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f the court in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait [SEQ_SPLITTER]in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy basen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
for that I insi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nuate, or toaze from thee thy
business, I am there[SEQ_SPLITTER]fore no courtier? I am courtier
cap-a-pe; and one [SEQ_SPLITTER]that will either push on or pluck
back thy busines[SEQ_SPLITTER]s there: whereupon I command thee to
open thy affa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir.

Shepherd:
My business, sir, is to the king.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]AUTOLYCUS:
What advocate hast thou to him?

Shephe[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd:
I know not, an't like you.

Clown:
Advocate's [SEQ_SPLITTER]the court-word for a pheasant: say you
have none.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Shepherd:
None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor[SEQ_SPLITTER] hen.

AUTOLYCUS:
How blessed are we that are not [SEQ_SPLITTER]simple men!
Yet nature might have made me as these[SEQ_SPLITTER] are,
Therefore I will not disdain.

Clown:
This c[SEQ_SPLITTER]annot be but a great courtier.

Shepherd:
His garm[SEQ_SPLITTER]ents are rich, but he wears
them not handsomely.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Clown:
He seems to be the more noble in being fant[SEQ_SPLITTER]astical:
a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the [SEQ_SPLITTER]picking
on's teeth.

AUTOLYCUS:
The fardel there? [SEQ_SPLITTER]what's i' the fardel?
Wherefore that box?

Shepher[SEQ_SPLITTER]d:
Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and[SEQ_SPLITTER] box,
which none must know but the king; and which[SEQ_SPLITTER] he
shall know within this hour, if I may come to [SEQ_SPLITTER]the
speech of him.

AUTOLYCUS:
Age, thou hast lost[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy labour.

Shepherd:
Why, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
new[SEQ_SPLITTER] ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
if[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
k[SEQ_SPLITTER]now the king is full of grief.

Shepard:
So 'tis s[SEQ_SPLITTER]aid, sir; about his son, that should have
married [SEQ_SPLITTER]a shepherd's daughter.

AUTOLYCUS:
If that shepher[SEQ_SPLITTER]d be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
the curses he [SEQ_SPLITTER]shall have, the tortures he shall
feel, will break[SEQ_SPLITTER] the back of man, the heart of monster.

Clown:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ink you so, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Not he alone shall su[SEQ_SPLITTER]ffer what wit can make heavy
and vengeance bitter;[SEQ_SPLITTER] but those that are germane to
him, though removed[SEQ_SPLITTER] fifty times, shall all come
under the hangman: wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich though it be great pity,
yet it is necessary. [SEQ_SPLITTER]An old sheep-whistling rogue a
ram-tender, to offe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r to have his daughter come into
grace! Some say h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e shall be stoned; but that death
is too soft for [SEQ_SPLITTER]him, say I draw our throne into a
sheep-cote! all [SEQ_SPLITTER]deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.

Clown:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an'[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
He has a son, who sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll be flayed alive; then
'nointed over with honey,[SEQ_SPLITTER] set on the head of a
wasp's nest; then stand till[SEQ_SPLITTER] he be three quarters
and a dram dead; then recove[SEQ_SPLITTER]red again with
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusi[SEQ_SPLITTER]on; then, raw as
he is, and in the hottest day pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]gnostication
proclaims, shall be be set against a [SEQ_SPLITTER]brick-wall, the
sun looking with a southward eye u[SEQ_SPLITTER]pon him, where he
is to behold him with flies blow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n to death. But what
talk we of these traitorly ra[SEQ_SPLITTER]scals, whose miseries
are to be smiled at, their o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ffences being so
capital? Tell me, for you seem to[SEQ_SPLITTER] be honest plain
men, what you have to the king: b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eing something
gently considered, I'll bring you w[SEQ_SPLITTER]here he is
aboard, tender your persons to his pres[SEQ_SPLITTER]ence,
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in[SEQ_SPLITTER] man
besides the king to effect your suits, here i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s man
shall do it.

Clown:
He seems to be of great[SEQ_SPLITTER] authority: close with him,
give him gold; and tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ugh authority be a stubborn
bear, yet he is oft le[SEQ_SPLITTER]d by the nose with gold: show
the inside of your p[SEQ_SPLITTER]urse to the outside of his hand,
and no more ado. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

Shepherd:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]An't please you, sir, to undertake the business fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r
us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as mu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch
more and leave this young man in pawn till I br[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing it you.

AUTOLYCUS:
After I have done what I p[SEQ_SPLITTER]romised?

Shepherd:
Ay, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Clown:
In some sort, sir: but though my case be [SEQ_SPLITTER]a pitiful
one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of[SEQ_SPLITTER] it.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the case of the shepher[SEQ_SPLITTER]d's son: hang him,
he'll be made an example.

Clow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n:
Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and [SEQ_SPLITTER]show
our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of[SEQ_SPLITTER] your
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Si[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, I
will give you as much as this old man does wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]en the
business is performed, and remain, as he sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ys, your
pawn till it be brought you.

AUTOLYCUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
he[SEQ_SPLITTER]dge and follow you.

Clown:
We are blest in this m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an, as I may say, even blest.

Shepherd:
Let's bef[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
AUTOLYCUS:
If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtune would
not suffer me: she drops booties in my[SEQ_SPLITTER] mouth. I am
courted now with a double occasion, g[SEQ_SPLITTER]old and a means
to do the prince my master good; w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hich who knows how
that may turn back to my advanc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ement? I will bring
these two moles, these blind o[SEQ_SPLITTER]nes, aboard him: if he
think it fit to shore them [SEQ_SPLITTER]again and that the
complaint they have to the king[SEQ_SPLITTER] concerns him
nothing, let him call me rogue for b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eing so far
officious; for I am proof against that[SEQ_SPLITTER] title and
what shame else belongs to't. To him wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll I present
them: there may be matter in it.

CLE[SEQ_SPLITTER]OMENES:
Sir, you have done enough, and have perfor[SEQ_SPLITTER]m'd
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
Mor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e penitence than done trespass: at the last,
Do as[SEQ_SPLITTER] the heavens have done, forget your evil;
With the[SEQ_SPLITTER]m forgive yourself.

LEONTES:
Whilst I remember
He[SEQ_SPLITTER]r and her virtues, I cannot forget
My blemishes in[SEQ_SPLITTER] them, and so still think of
The wrong I did mysel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f; which was so much,
That heirless it hath made m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y kingdom and
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t e'er man
Bred his hopes out of.

PAULINA:
True, [SEQ_SPLITTER]too true, my lord:
If, one by one, you wedded all [SEQ_SPLITTER]the world,
Or from the all that are took something[SEQ_SPLITTER] good,
To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
Wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld be unparallel'd.

LEONTES:
I think so. Kill'd!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
Sorel[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, to say I did; it is as bitter
Upon thy tongue a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s in my thought: now, good now,
Say so but seldom.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

CLEOMENES:
Not at all, good lady:
You might have[SEQ_SPLITTER] spoken a thousand things that would
Have done the[SEQ_SPLITTER] time more benefit and graced
Your kindness better[SEQ_SPLITTER].

PAULINA:
You are one of those
Would have him we[SEQ_SPLITTER]d again.

DION:
If you would not so,
You pity not [SEQ_SPLITTER]the state, nor the remembrance
Of his most soverei[SEQ_SPLITTER]gn name; consider little
What dangers, by his high[SEQ_SPLITTER]ness' fail of issue,
May drop upon his kingdom and[SEQ_SPLITTER] devour
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
What hol[SEQ_SPLITTER]ier than, for royalty's repair,
For present comfor[SEQ_SPLITTER]t and for future good,
To bless the bed of majesty[SEQ_SPLITTER] again
With a sweet fellow to't?

PAULINA:
There i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s none worthy,
Respecting her that's gone. Besides[SEQ_SPLITTER], the gods
Will have fulfill'd their secret purpos[SEQ_SPLITTER]es;
For has not the divine Apollo said,
Is't not t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he tenor of his oracle,
That King Leontes shall no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t have an heir
Till his lost child be found? which[SEQ_SPLITTER] that it shall,
Is all as monstrous to our human r[SEQ_SPLITTER]eason
As my Antigonus to break his grave
And come [SEQ_SPLITTER]again to me; who, on my life,
Did perish with the [SEQ_SPLITTER]infant. 'Tis your counsel
My lord should to the he[SEQ_SPLITTER]avens be contrary,
Oppose against their wills.
Car[SEQ_SPLITTER]e not for issue;
The crown will find an heir: grea[SEQ_SPLITTER]t Alexander
Left his to the worthiest; so his succ[SEQ_SPLITTER]essor
Was like to be the best.

LEONTES:
Good Paul[SEQ_SPLITTER]ina,
Who hast the memory of Hermione,
I know, in h[SEQ_SPLITTER]onour, O, that ever I
Had squared me to thy counse[SEQ_SPLITTER]l! then, even now,
I might have look'd upon my que[SEQ_SPLITTER]en's full eyes,
Have taken treasure from her lips-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-

PAULINA:
And left them
More rich for what they [SEQ_SPLITTER]yielded.

LEONTES:
Thou speak'st truth.
No more su[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
And bette[SEQ_SPLITTER]r used, would make her sainted spirit
Again posses[SEQ_SPLITTER]s her corpse, and on this stage,
Where we're offen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And begin, 'Why to me[SEQ_SPLITTER]?'

PAULINA:
Had she such power,
She had just caus[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

LEONTES:
She had; and would incense me
To murd[SEQ_SPLITTER]er her I married.

PAULINA:
I should so.
Were I th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
Her eye, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d tell me for what dull part in't
You chose her; t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen I'ld shriek, that even your ears
Should rift t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o hear me; and the words that follow'd
Should be '[SEQ_SPLITTER]Remember mine.'

LEONTES:
Stars, stars,
And all ey[SEQ_SPLITTER]es else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
I'll have n[SEQ_SPLITTER]o wife, Paulina.

PAULINA:
Will you swear
Never to[SEQ_SPLITTER] marry but by my free leave?

LEONTES:
Never, Paul[SEQ_SPLITTER]ina; so be blest my spirit!

PAULINA:
Then, good m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y lords, bear witness to his oath.

CLEOMENES:
You[SEQ_SPLITTER] tempt him over-much.

PAULINA:
Unless another,
As[SEQ_SPLITTER] like Hermione as is her picture,
Affront his eye.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

CLEOMENES:
Good madam,--

PAULINA:
I have done.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
No [SEQ_SPLITTER]remedy, but you will,--give me the office
To choos[SEQ_SPLITTER]e you a queen: she shall not be so young
As was yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur former; but she shall be such
As, walk'd your f[SEQ_SPLITTER]irst queen's ghost,
it should take joy
To see her [SEQ_SPLITTER]in your arms.

LEONTES:
My true Paulina,
We shall [SEQ_SPLITTER]not marry till thou bid'st us.

PAULINA:
That
Shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be when your first queen's again in breath;
Neve[SEQ_SPLITTER]r till then.

Gentleman:
One that gives out himsel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f Prince Florizel,
Son of Polixenes, with his prin[SEQ_SPLITTER]cess, she
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ccess
To your high presence.

LEONTES:
What with h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im? he comes not
Like to his father's greatness: h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is approach,
So out of circumstance and sudden, te[SEQ_SPLITTER]lls us
'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
By[SEQ_SPLITTER] need and accident. What train?

Gentleman:
But fe[SEQ_SPLITTER]w,
And those but mean.

LEONTES:
His princess, say[SEQ_SPLITTER] you, with him?

Gentleman:
Ay, the most peerless [SEQ_SPLITTER]piece of earth, I think,
That e'er the sun shone b[SEQ_SPLITTER]right on.

PAULINA:
O Hermione,
As every present t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ime doth boast itself
Above a better gone, so must[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy grave
Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ourself
Have said and writ so, but your writing no[SEQ_SPLITTER]w
Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
No[SEQ_SPLITTER]r was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
Flow'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
To say[SEQ_SPLITTER] you have seen a better.

Gentleman:
Pardon, madam[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
Will have[SEQ_SPLITTER] your tongue too. This is a creature,
Would she be[SEQ_SPLITTER]gin a sect, might quench the zeal
Of all professor[SEQ_SPLITTER]s else, make proselytes
Of who she but bid follow.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PAULINA:
How! not women?

Gentleman:
Women will [SEQ_SPLITTER]love her, that she is a woman
More worth than any [SEQ_SPLITTER]man; men, that she is
The rarest of all women.

LE[SEQ_SPLITTER]ONTES:
Go, Cleomenes;
Yourself, assisted with your[SEQ_SPLITTER] honour'd friends,
Bring them to our embracement. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Still, 'tis strange
He thus should steal upon us.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
PAULINA:
Had our prince,
Jewel of children, seen [SEQ_SPLITTER]this hour, he had pair'd
Well with this lord: ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e was not full a month
Between their births.

LEON[SEQ_SPLITTER]TES:
Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
He dies[SEQ_SPLITTER] to me again when talk'd of: sure,
When I shall se[SEQ_SPLITTER]e this gentleman, thy speeches
Will bring me to co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nsider that which may
Unfurnish me of reason. They[SEQ_SPLITTER] are come.
Your mother was most true to wedlock, p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rince;
For she did print your royal father off,
Co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
Your father's[SEQ_SPLITTER] image is so hit in you,
His very air, that I shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld call you brother,
As I did him, and speak of so[SEQ_SPLITTER]mething wildly
By us perform'd before. Most dearly[SEQ_SPLITTER] welcome!
And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, al[SEQ_SPLITTER]as!
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
You, gra[SEQ_SPLITTER]cious couple, do: and then I lost--
All mine own f[SEQ_SPLITTER]olly--the society,
Amity too, of your brave father[SEQ_SPLITTER], whom,
Though bearing misery, I desire my life
On[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce more to look on him.

FLORIZEL:
By his command
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Give you [SEQ_SPLITTER]all greetings that a king, at friend,
Can send his[SEQ_SPLITTER] brother: and, but infirmity
Which waits upon worn[SEQ_SPLITTER] times hath something seized
His wish'd ability, h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e had himself
The lands and waters 'twixt your thr[SEQ_SPLITTER]one and his
Measured to look upon you; whom he lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]es--
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And those that bear them living.

LEONTES:
O my b[SEQ_SPLITTER]rother,
Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e stir
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
So[SEQ_SPLITTER] rarely kind, are as interpreters
Of my behind-han[SEQ_SPLITTER]d slackness. Welcome hither,
As is the spring to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he earth. And hath he too
Exposed this paragon to [SEQ_SPLITTER]the fearful usage,
At least ungentle, of the dread[SEQ_SPLITTER]ful Neptune,
To greet a man not worth her pains, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]uch less
The adventure of her person?

FLORIZEL:
G[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood my lord,
She came from Libya.

LEONTES:
Where [SEQ_SPLITTER]the warlike Smalus,
That noble honour'd lord, is f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ear'd and loved?

FLORIZEL:
Most royal sir, from t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hence; from him, whose daughter
His tears proclaim[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d his, parting with her: thence,
A prosperous sou[SEQ_SPLITTER]th-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
To execute the [SEQ_SPLITTER]charge my father gave me
For visiting your highnes[SEQ_SPLITTER]s: my best train
I have from your Sicilian shores [SEQ_SPLITTER]dismiss'd;
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
Not on[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly my success in Libya, sir,
But my arrival and my[SEQ_SPLITTER] wife's in safety
Here where we are.

LEONTES:
The[SEQ_SPLITTER] blessed gods
Purge all infection from our air whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]lst you
Do climate here! You have a holy father,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER] graceful gentleman; against whose person,
So sacr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed as it is, I have done sin:
For which the heaven[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, taking angry note,
Have left me issueless; and [SEQ_SPLITTER]your father's blest,
As he from heaven merits it, [SEQ_SPLITTER]with you
Worthy his goodness. What might I have be[SEQ_SPLITTER]en,
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Such goodly things as you!

Lord:
Most noble sir,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That which I shall report will bear no credit,
We[SEQ_SPLITTER]re not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ohemia greets you from himself by me;
Desires you [SEQ_SPLITTER]to attach his son, who has--
His dignity and duty [SEQ_SPLITTER]both cast off--
Fled from his father, from his hop[SEQ_SPLITTER]es, and with
A shepherd's daughter.

LEONTES:
Wher[SEQ_SPLITTER]e's Bohemia? speak.

Lord:
Here in your city; I no[SEQ_SPLITTER]w came from him:
I speak amazedly; and it becomes
[SEQ_SPLITTER]My marvel and my message. To your court
Whiles he [SEQ_SPLITTER]was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
Of this fai[SEQ_SPLITTER]r couple, meets he on the way
The father of this s[SEQ_SPLITTER]eeming lady and
Her brother, having both their cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntry quitted
With this young prince.

FLORIZEL:
Ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]millo has betray'd me;
Whose honour and whose hone[SEQ_SPLITTER]sty till now
Endured all weathers.

Lord:
Lay't so[SEQ_SPLITTER] to his charge:
He's with the king your father.

L[SEQ_SPLITTER]EONTES:
Who? Camillo?

Lord:
Camillo, sir; I spake[SEQ_SPLITTER] with him; who now
Has these poor men in question.[SEQ_SPLITTER] Never saw I
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they k[SEQ_SPLITTER]iss the earth;
Forswear themselves as often as the[SEQ_SPLITTER]y speak:
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens the[SEQ_SPLITTER]m
With divers deaths in death.

PERDITA:
O my poor[SEQ_SPLITTER] father!
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave
Our contract celebrated.

LEONTES:
You are mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]ried?

FLORIZEL:
We are not, sir, nor are we like [SEQ_SPLITTER]to be;
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys fir[SEQ_SPLITTER]st:
The odds for high and low's alike.

LEONTES:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]y lord,
Is this the daughter of a king?

FLORIZEL:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
She is,
When once she is my wife.

LEONTES:
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]'once' I see by your good father's speed
Will come[SEQ_SPLITTER] on very slowly. I am sorry,
Most sorry, you have [SEQ_SPLITTER]broken from his liking
Where you were tied in duty[SEQ_SPLITTER], and as sorry
Your choice is not so rich in worth[SEQ_SPLITTER] as beauty,
That you might well enjoy her.

FLORIZ[SEQ_SPLITTER]EL:
Dear, look up:
Though Fortune, visible an enem[SEQ_SPLITTER]y,
Should chase us with my father, power no jot
Ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
Reme[SEQ_SPLITTER]mber since you owed no more to time
Than I do now:[SEQ_SPLITTER] with thought of such affections,
Step forth mine [SEQ_SPLITTER]advocate; at your request
My father will grant pre[SEQ_SPLITTER]cious things as trifles.

LEONTES:
Would he do so,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I'ld beg your precious mistress,
Which he counts [SEQ_SPLITTER]but a trifle.

PAULINA:
Sir, my liege,
Your eye ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th too much youth in't: not a month
'Fore your que[SEQ_SPLITTER]en died, she was more worth such gazes
Than what y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou look on now.

LEONTES:
I thought of her,
Even i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n these looks I made.
But your petition
Is yet una[SEQ_SPLITTER]nswer'd. I will to your father:
Your honour not o'[SEQ_SPLITTER]erthrown by your desires,
I am friend to them and [SEQ_SPLITTER]you: upon which errand
I now go toward him; theref[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore follow me
And mark what way I make: come, good[SEQ_SPLITTER] my lord.

AUTOLYCUS:
Beseech you, sir, were you p[SEQ_SPLITTER]resent at this relation?

First Gentleman:
I was b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
shep[SEQ_SPLITTER]herd deliver the manner how he found it:
whereupon[SEQ_SPLITTER], after a little amazedness, we were all
commanded[SEQ_SPLITTER] out of the chamber; only this methought I
heard t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he shepherd say, he found the child.

AUTOLYCUS:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] would most gladly know the issue of it.

First Ge[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntleman:
I make a broken delivery of the business;[SEQ_SPLITTER] but the
changes I perceived in the king and Camil[SEQ_SPLITTER]lo were
very notes of admiration: they seemed almo[SEQ_SPLITTER]st, with
staring on one another, to tear the cases[SEQ_SPLITTER] of their
eyes; there was speech in their dumbness[SEQ_SPLITTER], language
in their very gesture; they looked as t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hey had heard
of a world ransomed, or one destroye[SEQ_SPLITTER]d: a notable
passion of wonder appeared in them; b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut the wisest
beholder, that knew no more but seei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng, could not
say if the importance were joy or so[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrow; but in the
extremity of the one, it must nee[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds be.
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows mor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.
The news, Rogero?

Second Gentleman:
Nothing bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
king's da[SEQ_SPLITTER]ughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
broken o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut within this hour that ballad-makers
cannot be a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ble to express it.
Here comes the Lady Paulina's s[SEQ_SPLITTER]teward: he can
deliver you more. How goes it now, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir? this news
which is called true is so like an [SEQ_SPLITTER]old tale, that
the verity of it is in strong suspi[SEQ_SPLITTER]cion: has the king
found his heir?

Third Gentlema[SEQ_SPLITTER]n:
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
circu[SEQ_SPLITTER]mstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
see,[SEQ_SPLITTER] there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
of [SEQ_SPLITTER]Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
[SEQ_SPLITTER]know to be his character, the majesty of the
creat[SEQ_SPLITTER]ure in resemblance of the mother, the affection
of[SEQ_SPLITTER] nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]and many other evidences proclaim her with all
cer[SEQ_SPLITTER]tainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
the [SEQ_SPLITTER]meeting of the two kings?

Second Gentleman:
No.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Third Gentleman:
Then have you lost a sight, which[SEQ_SPLITTER] was to be seen,
cannot be spoken of. There might [SEQ_SPLITTER]you have beheld one
joy crown another, so and in s[SEQ_SPLITTER]uch manner that it
seemed sorrow wept to take leav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of them, for their
joy waded in tears. There was[SEQ_SPLITTER] casting up of eyes,
holding up of hands, with cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntenances of such
distraction that they were to be[SEQ_SPLITTER] known by garment,
not by favour. Our king, being [SEQ_SPLITTER]ready to leap out of
himself for joy of his found [SEQ_SPLITTER]daughter, as if that
joy were now become a loss, c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ries 'O, thy mother,
thy mother!' then asks Bohemi[SEQ_SPLITTER]a forgiveness; then
embraces his son-in-law; then [SEQ_SPLITTER]again worries he his
daughter with clipping her; n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow he thanks the old
shepherd, which stands by lik[SEQ_SPLITTER]e a weather-bitten
conduit of many kings' reigns. [SEQ_SPLITTER]I never heard of such
another encounter, which lam[SEQ_SPLITTER]es report to follow it
and undoes description to d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o it.

Second Gentleman:
What, pray you, became of[SEQ_SPLITTER] Antigonus, that carried
hence the child?

Third G[SEQ_SPLITTER]entleman:
Like an old tale still, which will have [SEQ_SPLITTER]matter to
rehearse, though credit be asleep and no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t an ear
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: [SEQ_SPLITTER]this
avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only[SEQ_SPLITTER] his
innocence, which seems much, to justify him, [SEQ_SPLITTER]but a
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina k[SEQ_SPLITTER]nows.

First Gentleman:
What became of his bark an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d his followers?

Third Gentleman:
Wrecked the sam[SEQ_SPLITTER]e instant of their master's death and
in the view [SEQ_SPLITTER]of the shepherd: so that all the
instruments which[SEQ_SPLITTER] aided to expose the child were
even then lost whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]n it was found. But O, the noble
combat that 'twix[SEQ_SPLITTER]t joy and sorrow was fought in
Paulina! She had on[SEQ_SPLITTER]e eye declined for the loss of
her husband, anothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r elevated that the oracle was
fulfilled: she lift[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed the princess from the earth,
and so locks her i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n embracing, as if she would pin
her to her heart [SEQ_SPLITTER]that she might no more be in danger
of losing.

Fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]rst Gentleman:
The dignity of this act was worth t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he audience of
kings and princes; for by such was [SEQ_SPLITTER]it acted.

Third Gentleman:
One of the prettiest t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ouches of all and that which
angled for mine eyes,[SEQ_SPLITTER] caught the water though not
the fish, was when, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the relation of the queen's
death, with the mann[SEQ_SPLITTER]er how she came to't bravely
confessed and lamente[SEQ_SPLITTER]d by the king, how
attentiveness wounded his daugh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter; till, from one
sign of dolour to another, she[SEQ_SPLITTER] did, with an 'Alas,'
I would fain say, bleed tear[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, for I am sure my
heart wept blood. Who was most[SEQ_SPLITTER] marble there changed
colour; some swooned, all so[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrowed: if all the world
could have seen 't, the w[SEQ_SPLITTER]oe had been universal.

First Gentleman:
Are they [SEQ_SPLITTER]returned to the court?

Third Gentleman:
No: the p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rincess hearing of her mother's statue,
which is i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
years in d[SEQ_SPLITTER]oing and now newly performed by that rare
Italian [SEQ_SPLITTER]master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
eternity[SEQ_SPLITTER] and could put breath into his work, would
beguile[SEQ_SPLITTER] Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
ape:[SEQ_SPLITTER] he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey say one would speak to her and stand in hope of[SEQ_SPLITTER]
answer: thither with all greediness of affection
[SEQ_SPLITTER]are they gone, and there they intend to sup.

Seco[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd Gentleman:
I thought she had some great matter [SEQ_SPLITTER]there in hand;
for she hath privately twice or thr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice a day, ever
since the death of Hermione, visit[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed that removed
house. Shall we thither and with o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur company piece
the rejoicing?

First Gentleman:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Who would be thence that has the benefit of access[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Let's along.

AUTOLYCUS:
Now, had I not the dash [SEQ_SPLITTER]of my former life in me,
would preferment drop on [SEQ_SPLITTER]my head. I brought the old
man and his son aboard [SEQ_SPLITTER]the prince: told him I heard
them talk of a fardel[SEQ_SPLITTER] and I know not what: but he
at that time, overfon[SEQ_SPLITTER]d of the shepherd's daughter,
so he then took her [SEQ_SPLITTER]to be, who began to be much
sea-sick, and himself [SEQ_SPLITTER]little better, extremity of
weather continuing, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is mystery remained
undiscovered. But 'tis all one[SEQ_SPLITTER] to me; for had I
been the finder out of this secr[SEQ_SPLITTER]et, it would not
have relished among my other disc[SEQ_SPLITTER]redits.
Here come those I have done good to agains[SEQ_SPLITTER]t my will,
and already appearing in the blossoms o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f their fortune.

Shepherd:
Come, boy; I am past m[SEQ_SPLITTER]oe children, but thy sons and
daughters will be al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l gentlemen born.

Clown:
You are well met, sir. Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou denied to fight with me
this other day, because[SEQ_SPLITTER] I was no gentleman born.
See you these clothes? s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay you see them not and
think me still no gentlema[SEQ_SPLITTER]n born: you were best say
these robes are not gent[SEQ_SPLITTER]lemen born: give me the
lie, do, and try whether I[SEQ_SPLITTER] am not now a gentleman born.

AUTOLYCUS:
I know y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou are now, sir, a gentleman born.

Clown:
Ay, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] have been so any time these four hours.

Shepherd[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
And so have I, boy.

Clown:
So you have: but I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]as a gentleman born before my
father; for the king[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s son took me by the hand, and
called me brother;[SEQ_SPLITTER] and then the two kings called my
father brother; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and then the prince my brother and
the princess my[SEQ_SPLITTER] sister called my father father; and
so we wept, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd there was the first gentleman-like
tears that e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ver we shed.

Shepherd:
We may live, son, to shed [SEQ_SPLITTER]many more.

Clown:
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eing in so
preposterous estate as we are.

AUTOLYC[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
faults I have committed to your worship and to g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ive
me your good report to the prince my master.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Shepherd:
Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle,[SEQ_SPLITTER] now we are
gentlemen.

Clown:
Thou wilt amend thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] life?

AUTOLYCUS:
Ay, an it like your good worshi[SEQ_SPLITTER]p.

Clown:
Give me thy hand: I will swear to the p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rince thou
art as honest a true fellow as any is i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n Bohemia.

Shepherd:
You may say it, but not swea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r it.

Clown:
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? [SEQ_SPLITTER]Let boors and
franklins say it, I'll swear it.

Sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]epherd:
How if it be false, son?

Clown:
If it be [SEQ_SPLITTER]ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
it in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
the pri[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
that t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
tall[SEQ_SPLITTER] fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk: [SEQ_SPLITTER]but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
be a t[SEQ_SPLITTER]all fellow of thy hands.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will prove [SEQ_SPLITTER]so, sir, to my power.

Clown:
Ay, by any means pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve a tall fellow: if I do not
wonder how thou dare[SEQ_SPLITTER]st venture to be drunk, not
being a tall fellow, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]rust me not. Hark! the kings
and the princes, our [SEQ_SPLITTER]kindred, are going to see the
queen's picture. Com[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, follow us: we'll be thy
good masters.

LEONTES:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]I have had of thee!

PAULINA:
What, sovereign sir,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I did not well I meant well. All my services
You [SEQ_SPLITTER]have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
With[SEQ_SPLITTER] your crown'd brother and these your contracted
He[SEQ_SPLITTER]irs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
It i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s a surplus of your grace, which never
My life may[SEQ_SPLITTER] last to answer.

LEONTES:
O Paulina,
We honour yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u with trouble: but we came
To see the statue of o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur queen: your gallery
Have we pass'd through, not[SEQ_SPLITTER] without much content
In many singularities; but w[SEQ_SPLITTER]e saw not
That which my daughter came to look upon[SEQ_SPLITTER],
The statue of her mother.

PAULINA:
As she lived[SEQ_SPLITTER] peerless,
So her dead likeness, I do well believe[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
Or hand of m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an hath done; therefore I keep it
Lonely, apart. B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut here it is: prepare
To see the life as lively m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ock'd as ever
Still sleep mock'd death: behold, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d say 'tis well.
I like your silence, it the more [SEQ_SPLITTER]shows off
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, [SEQ_SPLITTER]my liege,
Comes it not something near?

LEONTES:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]er natural posture!
Chide me, dear stone, that I m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay say indeed
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou a[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt she
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]s infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
Hermione wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s not so much wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this se[SEQ_SPLITTER]ems.

POLIXENES:
O, not by much.

PAULINA:
So much[SEQ_SPLITTER] the more our carver's excellence;
Which lets go b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y some sixteen years and makes her
As she lived no[SEQ_SPLITTER]w.

LEONTES:
As now she might have done,
So much t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o my good comfort, as it is
Now piercing to my sou[SEQ_SPLITTER]l. O, thus she stood,
Even with such life of majes[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty, warm life,
As now it coldly stands, when first[SEQ_SPLITTER] I woo'd her!
I am ashamed: does not the stone reb[SEQ_SPLITTER]uke me
For being more stone than it? O royal piece[SEQ_SPLITTER],
There's magic in thy majesty, which has
My evils[SEQ_SPLITTER] conjured to remembrance and
From thy admiring dau[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghter took the spirits,
Standing like stone with t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee.

PERDITA:
And give me leave,
And do not say '[SEQ_SPLITTER]tis superstition, that
I kneel and then implore he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r blessing. Lady,
Dear queen, that ended when I bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t began,
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

PAUL[SEQ_SPLITTER]INA:
O, patience!
The statue is but newly fix'd, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he colour's Not dry.

CAMILLO:
My lord, your sorro[SEQ_SPLITTER]w was too sore laid on,
Which sixteen winters cann[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot blow away,
So many summers dry; scarce any joy
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Did ever so long live; no sorrow
But kill'd itself[SEQ_SPLITTER] much sooner.

POLIXENES:
Dear my brother,
Let him[SEQ_SPLITTER] that was the cause of this have power
To take off[SEQ_SPLITTER] so much grief from you as he
Will piece up in him[SEQ_SPLITTER]self.

PAULINA:
Indeed, my lord,
If I had thought [SEQ_SPLITTER]the sight of my poor image
Would thus have wrought[SEQ_SPLITTER] you,--for the stone is mine--
I'ld not have show'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d it.

LEONTES:
Do not draw the curtain.

PAULINA:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
Ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y think anon it moves.

LEONTES:
Let be, let be.
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at was he that did make it? See, my lord,
Would yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u not deem it breathed? and that those veins
Did v[SEQ_SPLITTER]erily bear blood?

POLIXENES:
Masterly done:
The v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ery life seems warm upon her lip.

LEONTES:
The fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]xture of her eye has motion in't,
As we are mock'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] with art.

PAULINA:
I'll draw the curtain:
My lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d's almost so far transported that
He'll think ano[SEQ_SPLITTER]n it lives.

LEONTES:
O sweet Paulina,
Make me to [SEQ_SPLITTER]think so twenty years together!
No settled senses [SEQ_SPLITTER]of the world can match
The pleasure of that madnes[SEQ_SPLITTER]s. Let 't alone.

PAULINA:
I am sorry, sir, I have[SEQ_SPLITTER] thus far stirr'd you: but
I could afflict you far[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther.

LEONTES:
Do, Paulina;
For this affliction h[SEQ_SPLITTER]as a taste as sweet
As any cordial comfort. Still,[SEQ_SPLITTER] methinks,
There is an air comes from her: what fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne chisel
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck me,
For I will kiss her.

PAULINA:
Good my lord[SEQ_SPLITTER], forbear:
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
You'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
With oily[SEQ_SPLITTER] painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

LEONTES:
No,[SEQ_SPLITTER] not these twenty years.

PERDITA:
So long could I[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Stand by, a looker on.

PAULINA:
Either forbear,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
For more[SEQ_SPLITTER] amazement. If you can behold it,
I'll make the st[SEQ_SPLITTER]atue move indeed, descend
And take you by the hand[SEQ_SPLITTER]; but then you'll think--
Which I protest against-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-I am assisted
By wicked powers.

LEONTES:
What yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u can make her do,
I am content to look on: what t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o speak,
I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
To[SEQ_SPLITTER] make her speak as move.

PAULINA:
It is required
[SEQ_SPLITTER]You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
On:[SEQ_SPLITTER] those that think it is unlawful business
I am abo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut, let them depart.

LEONTES:
Proceed:
No foot sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all stir.

PAULINA:
Music, awake her; strike!
'Tis[SEQ_SPLITTER] time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
Strike[SEQ_SPLITTER] all that look upon with marvel. Come,
I'll fill y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our grave up: stir, nay, come away,
Bequeath to de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath your numbness, for from him
Dear life redeems [SEQ_SPLITTER]you. You perceive she stirs:
Start not; her action[SEQ_SPLITTER]s shall be holy as
You hear my spell is lawful: do[SEQ_SPLITTER] not shun her
Until you see her die again; for the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
Whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]n she was young you woo'd her; now in age
Is she b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ecome the suitor?

LEONTES:
O, she's warm!
If this[SEQ_SPLITTER] be magic, let it be an art
Lawful as eating.

POL[SEQ_SPLITTER]IXENES:
She embraces him.

CAMILLO:
She hangs abou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t his neck:
If she pertain to life let her speak t[SEQ_SPLITTER]oo.

POLIXENES:
Ay, and make't manifest where she [SEQ_SPLITTER]has lived,
Or how stolen from the dead.

PAULINA:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]That she is living,
Were it but told you, should b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hooted at
Like an old tale: but it appears she l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ives,
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little whil[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
Our [SEQ_SPLITTER]Perdita is found.

HERMIONE:
You gods, look down
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd from your sacred vials pour your graces
Upon my[SEQ_SPLITTER] daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
Where hast th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou been preserved? where lived? how found
Thy fath[SEQ_SPLITTER]er's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
Knowing by[SEQ_SPLITTER] Paulina that the oracle
Gave hope thou wast in be[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing, have preserved
Myself to see the issue.

PAUL[SEQ_SPLITTER]INA:
There's time enough for that;
Lest they desir[SEQ_SPLITTER]e upon this push to trouble
Your joys with like re[SEQ_SPLITTER]lation. Go together,
You precious winners all; you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r exultation
Partake to every one. I, an old turtl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]y mate, that's never to be found again,
Lament til[SEQ_SPLITTER]l I am lost.

LEONTES:
O, peace, Paulina!
Thou sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]uldst a husband take by my consent,
As I by thine [SEQ_SPLITTER]a wife: this is a match,
And made between's by vow[SEQ_SPLITTER]s. Thou hast found mine;
But how, is to be questio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n'd; for I saw her,
As I thought, dead, and have i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n vain said many
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not[SEQ_SPLITTER] seek far--
For him, I partly know his mind--to fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd thee
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
Is r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ichly noted and here justified
By us, a pair of ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngs. Let's from this place.
What! look upon my bro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther: both your pardons,
That e'er I put between y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our holy looks
My ill suspicion. This is your son-[SEQ_SPLITTER]in-law,
And son unto the king, who, heavens direct[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing,
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulin[SEQ_SPLITTER]a,
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
Each[SEQ_SPLITTER] one demand an answer to his part
Perform'd in thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s wide gap of time since first
We were dissever'd:[SEQ_SPLITTER] hastily lead away.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Escalus.

ESC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ALUS:
My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Of government the [SEQ_SPLITTER]properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect s[SEQ_SPLITTER]peech and discourse;
Since I am put to know that y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all[SEQ_SPLITTER] advice
My strength can give you: then no more rem[SEQ_SPLITTER]ains,
But that to your sufficiency, as your Worth [SEQ_SPLITTER]is able,
And let them work. The nature of our peop[SEQ_SPLITTER]le,
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For com[SEQ_SPLITTER]mon justice, you're as pregnant in
As art and prac[SEQ_SPLITTER]tise hath enriched any
That we remember. There is [SEQ_SPLITTER]our commission,
From which we would not have you w[SEQ_SPLITTER]arp. Call hither,
I say, bid come before us Angelo[SEQ_SPLITTER].
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u must know, we have with special soul
Elected him[SEQ_SPLITTER] our absence to supply,
Lent him our terror, dress[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d him with our love,
And given his deputation all[SEQ_SPLITTER] the organs
Of our own power: what think you of it[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

ESCALUS:
If any in Vienna be of worth
To underg[SEQ_SPLITTER]o such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Look where he comes.

ANGELO:
Alw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ays obedient to your grace's will,
I come to know [SEQ_SPLITTER]your pleasure.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Angelo,
There is a[SEQ_SPLITTER] kind of character in thy life,
That to the observ[SEQ_SPLITTER]er doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy [SEQ_SPLITTER]belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven do[SEQ_SPLITTER]th with us as we with torches do,
Not light them f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth[SEQ_SPLITTER] of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]irits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues, n[SEQ_SPLITTER]or Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her [SEQ_SPLITTER]excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determ[SEQ_SPLITTER]ines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks [SEQ_SPLITTER]and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo:--[SEQ_SPLITTER]
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality [SEQ_SPLITTER]and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart: [SEQ_SPLITTER]old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy seco[SEQ_SPLITTER]ndary.
Take thy commission.

ANGELO:
Now, good my [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] upon it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No more evasion:
We hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to[SEQ_SPLITTER] you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from [SEQ_SPLITTER]hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers its[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful val[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue. We shall write to you,
As time and our concern[SEQ_SPLITTER]ings shall importune,
How it goes with us, and do [SEQ_SPLITTER]look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou well;
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
O[SEQ_SPLITTER]f your commissions.

ANGELO:
Yet give leave, my lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd,
That we may bring you something on the way.

D[SEQ_SPLITTER]UKE VINCENTIO:
My haste may not admit it;
Nor need[SEQ_SPLITTER] you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple;[SEQ_SPLITTER] your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualif[SEQ_SPLITTER]y the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r hand:
I'll privily away. I love the people,
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]do not like to stage me to their eyes:
Through it [SEQ_SPLITTER]do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause [SEQ_SPLITTER]and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe [SEQ_SPLITTER]discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u well.

ANGELO:
The heavens give safety to your p[SEQ_SPLITTER]urposes!

ESCALUS:
Lead forth and bring you back i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n happiness!

DUKE:
I thank you. Fare you well.

E[SEQ_SPLITTER]SCALUS:
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o look into the bottom of my place:
A power I have[SEQ_SPLITTER], but of what strength and nature
I am not yet ins[SEQ_SPLITTER]tructed.

ANGELO:
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw[SEQ_SPLITTER] together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]ouching that point.

ESCALUS:
I'll wait upon your [SEQ_SPLITTER]honour.

LUCIO:
If the duke with the other dukes c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome not to
composition with the King of Hungary, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy then all
the dukes fall upon the king.

First G[SEQ_SPLITTER]entleman:
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing of
Hungary's!

Second Gentleman:
Amen.

LUCIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ped
one out of the table.

Second Gentleman:
'Thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] shalt not steal'?

LUCIO:
Ay, that he razed.

Fir[SEQ_SPLITTER]st Gentleman:
Why, 'twas a commandment to command [SEQ_SPLITTER]the captain and
all the rest from their functions:[SEQ_SPLITTER] they put forth
to steal. There's not a soldier of[SEQ_SPLITTER] us all, that, in
the thanksgiving before meat, do[SEQ_SPLITTER] relish the petition
well that prays for peace.

S[SEQ_SPLITTER]econd Gentleman:
I never heard any soldier dislike[SEQ_SPLITTER] it.

LUCIO:
I believe thee; for I think thou neve[SEQ_SPLITTER]r wast where
grace was said.

Second Gentleman:
No[SEQ_SPLITTER]? a dozen times at least.

First Gentleman:
What, [SEQ_SPLITTER]in metre?

LUCIO:
In any proportion or in any lang[SEQ_SPLITTER]uage.

First Gentleman:
I think, or in any religio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.

LUCIO:
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of[SEQ_SPLITTER] all
controversy: as, for example, thou thyself ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]t a
wicked villain, despite of all grace.

First G[SEQ_SPLITTER]entleman:
Well, there went but a pair of shears be[SEQ_SPLITTER]tween us.

LUCIO:
I grant; as there may between th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e lists and the
velvet. Thou art the list.

First [SEQ_SPLITTER]Gentleman:
And thou the velvet: thou art good velv[SEQ_SPLITTER]et; thou'rt
a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I[SEQ_SPLITTER] had as lief
be a list of an English kersey as be [SEQ_SPLITTER]piled, as thou
art piled, for a French velvet. Do [SEQ_SPLITTER]I speak
feelingly now?

LUCIO:
I think thou dost; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and, indeed, with most painful
feeling of thy spee[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch: I will, out of thine own
confession, learn to [SEQ_SPLITTER]begin thy health; but, whilst I
live, forget to dr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ink after thee.

First Gentleman:
I think I have d[SEQ_SPLITTER]one myself wrong, have I not?

Second Gentleman:
Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]es, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee.

LUCIO:
Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation[SEQ_SPLITTER] comes! I
have purchased as many diseases under he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r roof as come to--

Second Gentleman:
To what, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]pray?

LUCIO:
Judge.

Second Gentleman:
To three t[SEQ_SPLITTER]housand dolours a year.

First Gentleman:
Ay, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]more.

LUCIO:
A French crown more.

First Gentlema[SEQ_SPLITTER]n:
Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou
art full of error; I am sound.

LUCIO:
Nay, not[SEQ_SPLITTER] as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
things[SEQ_SPLITTER] that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
impiety ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]s made a feast of thee.

First Gentleman:
How now![SEQ_SPLITTER] which of your hips has the most profound sciatica[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well, well; there's one yond[SEQ_SPLITTER]er arrested and carried
to prison was worth five t[SEQ_SPLITTER]housand of you all.

Second Gentleman:
Who's that,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I pray thee?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Marry, sir, that[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s Claudio, Signior Claudio.

First Gentleman:
Cla[SEQ_SPLITTER]udio to prison? 'tis not so.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m carried away; and, which is more, within these
t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hree days his head to be chopped off.

LUCIO:
But,[SEQ_SPLITTER] after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt thou sure of this?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
I am too[SEQ_SPLITTER] sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
Julietta [SEQ_SPLITTER]with child.

LUCIO:
Believe me, this may be: he pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]omised to meet me two
hours since, and he was ever[SEQ_SPLITTER] precise in
promise-keeping.

Second Gentleman:
Be[SEQ_SPLITTER]sides, you know, it draws something near to the
sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]eech we had to such a purpose.

First Gentleman:
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]LUCIO:
Away! let's go learn the truth of it.

MIST[SEQ_SPLITTER]RESS OVERDONE:
Thus, what with the war, what with [SEQ_SPLITTER]the sweat, what
with the gallows and what with pov[SEQ_SPLITTER]erty, I am
custom-shrunk.
How now! what's the news[SEQ_SPLITTER] with you?

POMPEY:
Yonder man is carried to priso[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well; what has he done?

PO[SEQ_SPLITTER]MPEY:
A woman.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But what's his [SEQ_SPLITTER]offence?

POMPEY:
Groping for trouts in a peculiar[SEQ_SPLITTER] river.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What, is there a maid [SEQ_SPLITTER]with child by him?

POMPEY:
No, but there's a woma[SEQ_SPLITTER]n with maid by him. You have
not heard of the proc[SEQ_SPLITTER]lamation, have you?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What procl[SEQ_SPLITTER]amation, man?

POMPEY:
All houses in the suburbs o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f Vienna must be plucked down.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And what shall become of those in the city?

POMP[SEQ_SPLITTER]EY:
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down [SEQ_SPLITTER]too,
but that a wise burgher put in for them.

MIS[SEQ_SPLITTER]TRESS OVERDONE:
But shall all our houses of resort[SEQ_SPLITTER] in the suburbs be
pulled down?

POMPEY:
To the gr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ound, mistress.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Why, here's a [SEQ_SPLITTER]change indeed in the commonwealth!
What shall beco[SEQ_SPLITTER]me of me?

POMPEY:
Come; fear you not: good counse[SEQ_SPLITTER]llors lack no
clients: though you change your plac[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, you need not
change your trade; I'll be your ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]pster still.
Courage! there will be pity taken on [SEQ_SPLITTER]you: you that
have worn your eyes almost out in th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e service, you
will be considered.

MISTRESS OVERD[SEQ_SPLITTER]ONE:
What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's with[SEQ_SPLITTER]draw.

POMPEY:
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by [SEQ_SPLITTER]the provost to
prison; and there's Madam Juliet.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]CLAUDIO:
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the[SEQ_SPLITTER] world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Provost:
I do it not in evil disposition,
But from[SEQ_SPLITTER] Lord Angelo by special charge.

CLAUDIO:
Thus can[SEQ_SPLITTER] the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our of[SEQ_SPLITTER]fence by weight
The words of heaven; on whom it wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still 't[SEQ_SPLITTER]is just.

LUCIO:
Why, how now, Claudio! whence com[SEQ_SPLITTER]es this restraint?

CLAUDIO:
From too much liberty[SEQ_SPLITTER], my Lucio, liberty:
As surfeit is the father of m[SEQ_SPLITTER]uch fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Tur[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats [SEQ_SPLITTER]that ravin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil;[SEQ_SPLITTER] and when we drink we die.

LUCIO:
If could speak [SEQ_SPLITTER]so wisely under an arrest, I would
send for certai[SEQ_SPLITTER]n of my creditors: and yet, to say
the truth, I ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]d as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the moral[SEQ_SPLITTER]ity of imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
CLAUDIO:
What but to speak of would offend again.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

LUCIO:
What, is't murder?

CLAUDIO:
No.

LUCIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Lechery?

CLAUDIO:
Call it so.

Provost:
Away, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER]! you must go.

CLAUDIO:
One word, good friend. Lu[SEQ_SPLITTER]cio, a word with you.

LUCIO:
A hundred, if they'l[SEQ_SPLITTER]l do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?

CL[SEQ_SPLITTER]AUDIO:
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contrac[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
You know the[SEQ_SPLITTER] lady; she is fast my wife,
Save that we do the de[SEQ_SPLITTER]nunciation lack
Of outward order: this we came not[SEQ_SPLITTER] to,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in [SEQ_SPLITTER]the coffer of her friends,
From whom we thought it[SEQ_SPLITTER] meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for[SEQ_SPLITTER] us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual[SEQ_SPLITTER] entertainment
With character too gross is writ on[SEQ_SPLITTER] Juliet.

LUCIO:
With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
Un[SEQ_SPLITTER]happily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the d[SEQ_SPLITTER]uke--
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]reon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the sea[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, that it may know
He can command, lets it straig[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht feel the spur;
Whether the tyranny be in his pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ace,
Or in his emmence that fills it up,
I stagger[SEQ_SPLITTER] in:--but this new governor
Awakes me all the enro[SEQ_SPLITTER]lled penalties
Which have, like unscour'd armour, [SEQ_SPLITTER]hung by the wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e gone round
And none of them been worn; and, for [SEQ_SPLITTER]a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Fres[SEQ_SPLITTER]hly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

LUCIO:
I warra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
thy sho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
may sig[SEQ_SPLITTER]h it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
him.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]CLAUDIO:
I have done so, but he's not to be found.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay my sister should the cloister enter
And there r[SEQ_SPLITTER]eceive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the dang[SEQ_SPLITTER]er of my state:
Implore her, in my voice, that she[SEQ_SPLITTER] make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself as[SEQ_SPLITTER]say him:
I have great hope in that; for in her you[SEQ_SPLITTER]th
There is a prone and speechless dialect,
Such a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When s[SEQ_SPLITTER]he will play with reason and discourse,
And well s[SEQ_SPLITTER]he can persuade.

LUCIO:
I pray she may; as well f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or the encouragement of the
like, which else would[SEQ_SPLITTER] stand under grievous
imposition, as for the enjoy[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing of thy life, who I
would be sorry should be th[SEQ_SPLITTER]us foolishly lost at a
game of tick-tack. I'll to [SEQ_SPLITTER]her.

CLAUDIO:
I thank you, good friend Lucio.

LU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CIO:
Within two hours.

CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, aw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, holy father; throw away t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More[SEQ_SPLITTER] grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing youth.

FRIAR THOMAS:
May your grace speak of [SEQ_SPLITTER]it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My holy sir, none better know[SEQ_SPLITTER]s than you
How I have ever loved the life removed
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where y[SEQ_SPLITTER]outh, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
I have [SEQ_SPLITTER]deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and f[SEQ_SPLITTER]irm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
And so[SEQ_SPLITTER] it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f me why I do this?

FRIAR THOMAS:
Gladly, my lord[SEQ_SPLITTER].

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We have strict statutes and mos[SEQ_SPLITTER]t biting laws.
The needful bits and curbs to heads[SEQ_SPLITTER]trong weeds,
Which for this nineteen years we have[SEQ_SPLITTER] let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]aving bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Onl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y to stick it in their children's sight
For terror[SEQ_SPLITTER], not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice [SEQ_SPLITTER]by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite a[SEQ_SPLITTER]thwart
Goes all decorum.

FRIAR THOMAS:
It rested [SEQ_SPLITTER]in your grace
To unloose this tied-up justice when[SEQ_SPLITTER] you pleased:
And it in you more dreadful would ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]do fear, too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my fault to give[SEQ_SPLITTER] the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny to strike[SEQ_SPLITTER] and gall them
For what I bid them do: for we bid [SEQ_SPLITTER]this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissiv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e pass
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y father,
I have on Angelo imposed the office;
Who[SEQ_SPLITTER] may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
And y[SEQ_SPLITTER]et my nature never in the fight
To do in slander. [SEQ_SPLITTER]And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r of your order,
Visit both prince and people: the[SEQ_SPLITTER]refore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit and in[SEQ_SPLITTER]struct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Lik[SEQ_SPLITTER]e a true friar. More reasons for this action
At ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r more leisure shall I render you;
Only, this one:[SEQ_SPLITTER] Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard with en[SEQ_SPLITTER]vy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that[SEQ_SPLITTER] his appetite
Is more to bread than stone: hence s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall we see,
If power change purpose, what our see[SEQ_SPLITTER]mers be.

ISABELLA:
And have you nuns no farther p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rivileges?

FRANCISCA:
Are not these large enough?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ISABELLA:
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re;
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upo[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

L[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCIO:

ISABELLA:
Who's that which calls?

FRANCISC[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you [SEQ_SPLITTER]the key, and know his business of him;
You may, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]may not; you are yet unsworn.
When you have vow'd,[SEQ_SPLITTER] you must not speak with men
But in the presence o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f the prioress:
Then, if you speak, you must not s[SEQ_SPLITTER]how your face,
Or, if you show your face, you must[SEQ_SPLITTER] not speak.
He calls again; I pray you, answer him[SEQ_SPLITTER].

ISABELLA:
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that c[SEQ_SPLITTER]alls

LUCIO:
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those che[SEQ_SPLITTER]ek-roses
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stea[SEQ_SPLITTER]d me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novic[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of this place and the fair sister
To her unhappy[SEQ_SPLITTER] brother Claudio?

ISABELLA:
Why 'her unhappy brot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her'? let me ask,
The rather for I now must make y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou know
I am that Isabella and his sister.

LUCIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

ISABELL[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
Woe me! for what?

LUCIO:
For that which, if my[SEQ_SPLITTER]self might be his judge,
He should receive his pun[SEQ_SPLITTER]ishment in thanks:
He hath got his friend with chi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld.

ISABELLA:
Sir, make me not your story.

LUCIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
It is true.
I would not--though 'tis my familiar[SEQ_SPLITTER] sin
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]ongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
By your r[SEQ_SPLITTER]enouncement an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith in sincerity,
As with a saint.

ISABELLA:
You [SEQ_SPLITTER]do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

LUCIO:
Do no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Your b[SEQ_SPLITTER]rother and his lover have embraced:
As those that [SEQ_SPLITTER]feed grow full, as blossoming time
That from the s[SEQ_SPLITTER]eedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, [SEQ_SPLITTER]even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full til[SEQ_SPLITTER]th and husbandry.

ISABELLA:
Some one with child b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y him? My cousin Juliet?

LUCIO:
Is she your cousi[SEQ_SPLITTER]n?

ISABELLA:
Adoptedly; as school-maids change th[SEQ_SPLITTER]eir names
By vain though apt affection.

LUCIO:
Sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]e it is.

ISABELLA:
O, let him marry her.

LUCIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]This is the point.
The duke is very strangely gone[SEQ_SPLITTER] from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one[SEQ_SPLITTER],
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
By t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hose that know the very nerves of state,
His givin[SEQ_SPLITTER]gs-out were of an infinite distance
From his true-[SEQ_SPLITTER]meant design. Upon his place,
And with full line o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose [SEQ_SPLITTER]blood
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
The [SEQ_SPLITTER]wanton stings and motions of the sense,
But doth r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he mind, study and fast.
He--to give fear to use a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd liberty,
Which have for long run by the hideous[SEQ_SPLITTER] law,
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
Un[SEQ_SPLITTER]der whose heavy sense your brother's life
Falls in[SEQ_SPLITTER]to forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And follows clos[SEQ_SPLITTER]e the rigour of the statute,
To make him an exampl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e. All hope is gone,
Unless you have the grace by [SEQ_SPLITTER]your fair prayer
To soften Angelo: and that's my p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith of business
'Twixt you and your poor brother.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ISABELLA:
Doth he so seek his life?

LUCIO:
Has c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ensured him
Already; and, as I hear, the provost h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath
A warrant for his execution.

ISABELLA:
Alas! [SEQ_SPLITTER]what poor ability's in me
To do him good?

LUCIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Assay the power you have.

ISABELLA:
My power? Ala[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, I doubt--

LUCIO:
Our doubts are traitors
And m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to[SEQ_SPLITTER] know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ISABELLA:
I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO:
But sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]eedily.

ISABELLA:
I will about it straight;
No lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nger staying but to give the mother
Notice of my a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ffair. I humbly thank you:
Commend me to my brothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r: soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my [SEQ_SPLITTER]success.

LUCIO:
I take my leave of you.

ISABELLA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Good sir, adieu.

ANGELO:
We must not make a sca[SEQ_SPLITTER]recrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds[SEQ_SPLITTER] of prey,
And let it keep one shape, till custom m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake it
Their perch and not their terror.

ESCALUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a litt[SEQ_SPLITTER]le,
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gen[SEQ_SPLITTER]tleman
Whom I would save, had a most noble father![SEQ_SPLITTER]
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]st strait in virtue,
That, in the working of your [SEQ_SPLITTER]own affections,
Had time cohered with place or pla[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur blood
Could have attain'd the effect of your ow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n purpose,
Whether you had not sometime in your li[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And pull'd the law upon you.

ANGELO:
'Tis one thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. [SEQ_SPLITTER]I not deny,
The jury, passing on the prisoner's li[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe,
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Gu[SEQ_SPLITTER]iltier than him they try. What's open made to just[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice,
That justice seizes: what know the laws
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
Because [SEQ_SPLITTER]we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his[SEQ_SPLITTER] offence
For I have had such faults; but rather te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let[SEQ_SPLITTER] mine own judgment pattern out my death,
And nothi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng come in partial. Sir, he must die.

ESCALUS:
Be[SEQ_SPLITTER] it as your wisdom will.

ANGELO:
Where is the pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]vost?

Provost:
Here, if it like your honour.

ANG[SEQ_SPLITTER]ELO:
See that Claudio
Be executed by nine to-morro[SEQ_SPLITTER]w morning:
Bring him his confessor, let him be pre[SEQ_SPLITTER]pared;
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

E[SEQ_SPLITTER]SCALUS:

ELBOW:
Come, bring them away: if these be[SEQ_SPLITTER] good people in
a commonweal that do nothing but u[SEQ_SPLITTER]se their abuses in
common houses, I know no law: b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ring them away.

ANGELO:
How now, sir! What's your[SEQ_SPLITTER] name? and what's the matter?

ELBOW:
If it Please[SEQ_SPLITTER] your honour, I am the poor duke's
constable, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
justice, sir, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] do bring in here before your good
honour two noto[SEQ_SPLITTER]rious benefactors.

ANGELO:
Benefactors? Well; wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t benefactors are they? are
they not malefactors?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ELBOW:
If it? please your honour, I know not well[SEQ_SPLITTER] what they
are: but precise villains they are, tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t I am sure
of; and void of all profanation in the[SEQ_SPLITTER] world that
good Christians ought to have.

ESCALU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

AN[SEQ_SPLITTER]GELO:
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur
name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?

POMPEY:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.

ANGELO:
What a[SEQ_SPLITTER]re you, sir?

ELBOW:
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parc[SEQ_SPLITTER]el-bawd; one that
serves a bad woman; whose house,[SEQ_SPLITTER] sir, was, as they
say, plucked down in the suburb[SEQ_SPLITTER]s; and now she
professes a hot-house, which, I thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nk, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS:
How know yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u that?

ELBOW:
My wife, sir, whom I detest before[SEQ_SPLITTER] heaven and your honour,--

ESCALUS:
How? thy wife[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

ELBOW:
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an hon[SEQ_SPLITTER]est woman,--

ESCALUS:
Dost thou detest her theref[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore?

ELBOW:
I say, sir, I will detest myself also[SEQ_SPLITTER], as well as
she, that this house, if it be not a [SEQ_SPLITTER]bawd's house,
it is pity of her life, for it is a [SEQ_SPLITTER]naughty house.

ESCALUS:
How dost thou know that, [SEQ_SPLITTER]constable?

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if[SEQ_SPLITTER] she had been a woman
cardinally given, might have[SEQ_SPLITTER] been accused in
fornication, adultery, and all un[SEQ_SPLITTER]cleanliness there.

ESCALUS:
By the woman's means?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ELBOW:
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t as she
spit in his face, so she defied him.

POM[SEQ_SPLITTER]PEY:
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so[SEQ_SPLITTER].

ELBOW:
Prove it before these varlets here, thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] honourable
man; prove it.

ESCALUS:
Do you hear h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow he misplaces?

POMPEY:
Sir, she came in great w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith child; and longing,
saving your honour's rever[SEQ_SPLITTER]ence, for stewed prunes;
sir, we had but two in th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e house, which at that very
distant time stood, as[SEQ_SPLITTER] it were, in a fruit-dish, a
dish of some three-pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce; your honours have seen
such dishes; they are [SEQ_SPLITTER]not China dishes, but very
good dishes,--

ESCALUS[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.

POMP[SEQ_SPLITTER]EY:
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein[SEQ_SPLITTER] in
the right: but to the point. As I say, this
Mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]stress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
bei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
prun[SEQ_SPLITTER]es; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
Mas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
re[SEQ_SPLITTER]st, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very[SEQ_SPLITTER]
honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could[SEQ_SPLITTER]
not give you three-pence again.

FROTH:
No, indee[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.

POMPEY:
Very well: you being then, if you be r[SEQ_SPLITTER]emembered,
cracking the stones of the foresaid pru[SEQ_SPLITTER]nes,--

FROTH:
Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY:
Why, [SEQ_SPLITTER]very well; I telling you then, if you be
remembere[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, that such a one and such a one were past
cure o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
good[SEQ_SPLITTER] diet, as I told you,--

FROTH:
All this is true.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
POMPEY:
Why, very well, then,--

ESCALUS:
Come, y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
was do[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
complain[SEQ_SPLITTER] of? Come me to what was done to her.

POMPEY:
Sir[SEQ_SPLITTER], your honour cannot come to that yet.

ESCALUS:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, sir, nor I mean it not.

POMPEY:
Sir, but you s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall come to it, by your honour's
leave. And, I be[SEQ_SPLITTER]seech you, look into Master Froth
here, sir; a man[SEQ_SPLITTER] of four-score pound a year; whose
father died at [SEQ_SPLITTER]Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
Master Froth?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]FROTH:
All-hallond eve.

POMPEY:
Why, very well; I[SEQ_SPLITTER] hope here be truths. He, sir,
sitting, as I say, [SEQ_SPLITTER]in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
the Bunch of Grape[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, where indeed you have a delight
to sit, have yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u not?

FROTH:
I have so; because it is an open ro[SEQ_SPLITTER]om and good for winter.

POMPEY:
Why, very well, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO:
This will las[SEQ_SPLITTER]t out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest t[SEQ_SPLITTER]here: I'll take my leave.
And leave you to the hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ring of the cause;
Hoping you'll find good cause t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o whip them all.

ESCALUS:
I think no less. Good m[SEQ_SPLITTER]orrow to your lordship.
Now, sir, come on: what wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s done to Elbow's wife, once more?

POMPEY:
Once, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir? there was nothing done to her once.

ELBOW:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my[SEQ_SPLITTER] wife.

POMPEY:
I beseech your honour, ask me.

ES[SEQ_SPLITTER]CALUS:
Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
POMPEY:
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentlema[SEQ_SPLITTER]n's face.
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour;[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'tis for a
good purpose. Doth your honour mark hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s face?

ESCALUS:
Ay, sir, very well.

POMPEY:
Nay[SEQ_SPLITTER]; I beseech you, mark it well.

ESCALUS:
Well, I d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o so.

POMPEY:
Doth your honour see any harm in hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s face?

ESCALUS:
Why, no.

POMPEY:
I'll be suppos[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed upon a book, his face is the worst
thing about [SEQ_SPLITTER]him. Good, then; if his face be the
worst thing ab[SEQ_SPLITTER]out him, how could Master Froth do the
constable's[SEQ_SPLITTER] wife any harm? I would know that of
your honour.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ESCALUS:
He's in the right. Constable, what say y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou to it?

ELBOW:
First, an it like you, the house[SEQ_SPLITTER] is a respected
house; next, this is a respected f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ellow; and his
mistress is a respected woman.

POM[SEQ_SPLITTER]PEY:
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respect[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed
person than any of us all.

ELBOW:
Varlet, thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
time has ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]t to come that she was ever respected
with man, wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]man, or child.

POMPEY:
Sir, she was respected wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h him before he married with her.

ESCALUS:
Which [SEQ_SPLITTER]is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
this tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue?

ELBOW:
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]wicked
Hannibal! I respected with her before I was[SEQ_SPLITTER] married
to her! If ever I was respected with her,[SEQ_SPLITTER] or she
with me, let not your worship think me the[SEQ_SPLITTER] poor
duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hann[SEQ_SPLITTER]ibal, or
I'll have mine action of battery on thee.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ESCALUS:
If he took you a box o' the ear, you mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght have your
action of slander too.

ELBOW:
Marry[SEQ_SPLITTER], I thank your good worship for it. What is't
your[SEQ_SPLITTER] worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]itiff?

ESCALUS:
Truly, officer, because he hath s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome offences in him
that thou wouldst discover if [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou couldst, let him
continue in his courses till[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou knowest what they
are.

ELBOW:
Marry, I than[SEQ_SPLITTER]k your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
wicked var[SEQ_SPLITTER]let, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
to conti[SEQ_SPLITTER]nue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.

ESCAL[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
Where were you born, friend?

FROTH:
Here in V[SEQ_SPLITTER]ienna, sir.

ESCALUS:
Are you of fourscore pounds [SEQ_SPLITTER]a year?

FROTH:
Yes, an't please you, sir.

ESCALU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPHEY:
Tapst[SEQ_SPLITTER]er; a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS:
Your mistres[SEQ_SPLITTER]s' name?

POMPHEY:
Mistress Overdone.

ESCALUS:
Ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th she had any more than one husband?

POMPEY:
Nin[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS:
Nine! Come[SEQ_SPLITTER] hither to me, Master Froth. Master
Froth, I would[SEQ_SPLITTER] not have you acquainted with
tapsters: they will [SEQ_SPLITTER]draw you, Master Froth, and you
will hang them. Ge[SEQ_SPLITTER]t you gone, and let me hear no
more of you.

FROTH[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never[SEQ_SPLITTER]
come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn[SEQ_SPLITTER]
in.

ESCALUS:
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: [SEQ_SPLITTER]farewell.
Come you hither to me, Master tapster. W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat's your
name, Master tapster?

POMPEY:
Pompey.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ESCALUS:
What else?

POMPEY:
Bum, sir.

ESCALUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u;
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey [SEQ_SPLITTER]the
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u
not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better [SEQ_SPLITTER]for you.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat would live.

ESCALUS:
How would you live, Pomp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey? by being a bawd? What
do you think of the trad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?

POMPEY:
If the l[SEQ_SPLITTER]aw would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS:
But the law will[SEQ_SPLITTER] not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
not be allowed[SEQ_SPLITTER] in Vienna.

POMPEY:
Does your worship mean to gel[SEQ_SPLITTER]d and splay all the
youth of the city?

ESCALUS:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, Pompey.

POMPEY:
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion[SEQ_SPLITTER], they will to't then.
If your worship will take o[SEQ_SPLITTER]rder for the drabs and
the knaves, you need not to[SEQ_SPLITTER] fear the bawds.

ESCALUS:
There are pretty orders[SEQ_SPLITTER] beginning, I can tell you:
it is but heading and [SEQ_SPLITTER]hanging.

POMPEY:
If you head and hang all that of[SEQ_SPLITTER]fend that way but
for ten year together, you'll be[SEQ_SPLITTER] glad to give out a
commission for more heads: if [SEQ_SPLITTER]this law hold in
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]irest house in it
after three-pence a bay: if you [SEQ_SPLITTER]live to see this
come to pass, say Pompey told you[SEQ_SPLITTER] so.

ESCALUS:
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in req[SEQ_SPLITTER]uital of your
prophecy, hark you: I advise you, le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t me not find
you before me again upon any complai[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt whatsoever;
no, not for dwelling where you do: [SEQ_SPLITTER]if I do, Pompey,
I shall beat you to your tent, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, [SEQ_SPLITTER]Pompey, I shall
have you whipt: so, for this time,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Pompey, fare you well.

POMPEY:
I thank your wors[SEQ_SPLITTER]hip for your good counsel:
but I shall follow it a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the flesh and fortune shall
better determine.
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
The valia[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt heart is not whipt out of his trade.

ESCALUS:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Mast[SEQ_SPLITTER]er
constable. How long have you been in this place[SEQ_SPLITTER] of constable?

ELBOW:
Seven year and a half, sir.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ESCALUS:
I thought, by your readiness in the off[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice, you had
continued in it some time. You say, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]even years together?

ELBOW:
And a half, sir.

ESC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ALUS:
Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They [SEQ_SPLITTER]do you
wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there [SEQ_SPLITTER]not men
in your ward sufficient to serve it?

ELBO[SEQ_SPLITTER]W:
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as [SEQ_SPLITTER]they
are chosen, they are glad to choose me for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]em; I
do it for some piece of money, and go throug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h with
all.

ESCALUS:
Look you bring me in the nam[SEQ_SPLITTER]es of some six or seven,
the most sufficient of yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur parish.

ELBOW:
To your worship's house, sir?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]ESCALUS:
To my house. Fare you well.
What's o'cloc[SEQ_SPLITTER]k, think you?

Justice:
Eleven, sir.

ESCALUS:
I p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ray you home to dinner with me.

Justice:
I humbly[SEQ_SPLITTER] thank you.

ESCALUS:
It grieves me for the death [SEQ_SPLITTER]of Claudio;
But there's no remedy.

Justice:
Lord [SEQ_SPLITTER]Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS:
It is but needful:
Mer[SEQ_SPLITTER]cy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Pardon is sti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio[SEQ_SPLITTER]! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.

Servant:
He's he[SEQ_SPLITTER]aring of a cause; he will come straight
I'll tell [SEQ_SPLITTER]him of you.

Provost:
Pray you, do.
I'll know
His [SEQ_SPLITTER]pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but[SEQ_SPLITTER] as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack[SEQ_SPLITTER] of this vice; and he
To die for't!

ANGELO:
Now, [SEQ_SPLITTER]what's the matter. Provost?

Provost:
Is it your w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill Claudio shall die tomorrow?

ANGELO:
Did not I[SEQ_SPLITTER] tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
Why dost tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u ask again?

Provost:
Lest I might be too rash:
U[SEQ_SPLITTER]nder your good correction, I have seen,
When, afte[SEQ_SPLITTER]r execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er his doom.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ANGELO:
Go to; let that be mine:
Do you your off[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice, or give up your place,
And you shall well be [SEQ_SPLITTER]spared.

Provost:
I crave your honour's pardon.
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]he's very near her hour.

ANGELO:
Dispose of her
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o some more fitter place, and that with speed.

Se[SEQ_SPLITTER]rvant:
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
Des[SEQ_SPLITTER]ires access to you.

ANGELO:
Hath he a sister?

Pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ovost:
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] to be shortly of a sisterhood,
If not already.

A[SEQ_SPLITTER]NGELO:
Well, let her be admitted.
See you the forn[SEQ_SPLITTER]icatress be removed:
Let have needful, but not lav[SEQ_SPLITTER]ish, means;
There shall be order for't.

Provost:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]God save your honour!

ANGELO:
Stay a little while[SEQ_SPLITTER].
You're welcome: what's your will?

ISABELLA:
I a[SEQ_SPLITTER]m a woeful suitor to your honour,
Please but your [SEQ_SPLITTER]honour hear me.

ANGELO:
Well; what's your suit?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]ISABELLA:
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d most desire should meet the blow of justice;
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] which I would not plead, but that I must;
For whi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch I must not plead, but that I am
At war 'twixt w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill and will not.

ANGELO:
Well; the matter?

ISAB[SEQ_SPLITTER]ELLA:
I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
I do b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eseech you, let it be his fault,
And not my brothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r.

Provost:

ANGELO:
Condemn the fault and not th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e actor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it[SEQ_SPLITTER] be done:
Mine were the very cipher of a function,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd let go by the actor.

ISABELLA:
O just but seve[SEQ_SPLITTER]re law!
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]nour!

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Must he needs die?

ANGEL[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
Maiden, no remedy.

ISABELLA:
Yes; I do think t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat you might pardon him,
And neither heaven nor m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an grieve at the mercy.

ANGELO:
I will not do't.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ISABELLA:
But can you, if you would?

ANGELO:
Loo[SEQ_SPLITTER]k, what I will not, that I cannot do.

ISABELLA:
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
If s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o your heart were touch'd with that remorse
As min[SEQ_SPLITTER]e is to him?

ANGELO:
He's sentenced; 'tis too lat[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Too late? why, no; I, that d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o speak a word.
May call it back again. Well, beli[SEQ_SPLITTER]eve this,
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
The ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]rshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
Become th[SEQ_SPLITTER]em with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If[SEQ_SPLITTER] he had been as you and you as he,
You would have [SEQ_SPLITTER]slipt like him; but he, like you,
Would not have b[SEQ_SPLITTER]een so stern.

ANGELO:
Pray you, be gone.

ISABELL[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere Isabel! should it then be thus?
No; I would te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll what 'twere to be a judge,
And what a prisoner.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Your brother is a forfeit of the[SEQ_SPLITTER] law,
And you but waste your words.

ISABELLA:
Ala[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, alas!
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit[SEQ_SPLITTER] once;
And He that might the vantage best have too[SEQ_SPLITTER]k
Found out the remedy. How would you be,
If He, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hich is the top of judgment, should
But judge you [SEQ_SPLITTER]as you are? O, think on that;
And mercy then will [SEQ_SPLITTER]breathe within your lips,
Like man new made.

ANGE[SEQ_SPLITTER]LO:
Be you content, fair maid;
It is the law, not [SEQ_SPLITTER]I condemn your brother:
Were he my kinsman, brothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, or my son,
It should be thus with him: he must [SEQ_SPLITTER]die tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
To-morrow! O, that's sudd[SEQ_SPLITTER]en! Spare him, spare him!
He's not prepared for de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of sea[SEQ_SPLITTER]son: shall we serve heaven
With less respect than [SEQ_SPLITTER]we do minister
To our gross selves? Good, good my [SEQ_SPLITTER]lord, bethink you;
Who is it that hath died for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is offence?
There's many have committed it.

LUCIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:

ANGELO:
The law hath not been dead, though it h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath slept:
Those many had not dared to do that evi[SEQ_SPLITTER]l,
If the first that did the edict infringe
Had an[SEQ_SPLITTER]swer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
Takes note of [SEQ_SPLITTER]what is done; and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glas[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, that shows what future evils,
Either new, or by[SEQ_SPLITTER] remissness new-conceived,
And so in progress to b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hatch'd and born,
Are now to have no successive [SEQ_SPLITTER]degrees,
But, ere they live, to end.

ISABELLA:
Ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]t show some pity.

ANGELO:
I show it most of all w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not[SEQ_SPLITTER] know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Your broth[SEQ_SPLITTER]er dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA:
So you m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust be the first that gives this sentence,
And he,[SEQ_SPLITTER] that suffer's. O, it is excellent
To have a giant[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s strength; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a [SEQ_SPLITTER]giant.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Could great men thunder
[SEQ_SPLITTER]As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]or every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heav[SEQ_SPLITTER]en for thunder;
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heav[SEQ_SPLITTER]en,
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the[SEQ_SPLITTER] soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Drest in a littl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e brief authority,
Most ignorant of what he's most[SEQ_SPLITTER] assured,
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
P[SEQ_SPLITTER]lays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
Would [SEQ_SPLITTER]all themselves laugh mortal.

LUCIO:

Provost:

IS[SEQ_SPLITTER]ABELLA:
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]But in the less foul profanation.

LUCIO:
Thou'rt [SEQ_SPLITTER]i' the right, girl; more o, that.

ISABELLA:
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]in the captain's but a choleric word,
Which in the[SEQ_SPLITTER] soldier is flat blasphemy.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Why d[SEQ_SPLITTER]o you put these sayings upon me?

ISABELLA:
Becaus[SEQ_SPLITTER]e authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a[SEQ_SPLITTER] kind of medicine in itself,
That skins the vice o[SEQ_SPLITTER]' the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask [SEQ_SPLITTER]your heart what it doth know
That's like my brothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such[SEQ_SPLITTER] as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your t[SEQ_SPLITTER]ongue
Against my brother's life.

ANGELO:

ISABELL[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO:
I will beth[SEQ_SPLITTER]ink me: come again tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
Hark how I[SEQ_SPLITTER]'ll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.

ANGELO:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow! bribe me?

ISABELLA:
Ay, with such gifts that [SEQ_SPLITTER]heaven shall share with you.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
No[SEQ_SPLITTER]t with fond shekels of the tested gold,
Or stones [SEQ_SPLITTER]whose rates are either rich or poor
As fancy value[SEQ_SPLITTER]s them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at [SEQ_SPLITTER]heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from [SEQ_SPLITTER]preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e dedicate
To nothing temporal.

ANGELO:
Well; com[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to me to-morrow.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Heaven keep [SEQ_SPLITTER]your honour safe!

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
At what hour[SEQ_SPLITTER] to-morrow
Shall I attend your lordship?

ANGELO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]At any time 'fore noon.

ISABELLA:
'Save your hono[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur!

ANGELO:
From thee, even from thy virtue!
What[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not [SEQ_SPLITTER]she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
That, lying b[SEQ_SPLITTER]y the violet in the sun,
Do as the carrion does, n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot as the flower,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]n it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall we desire to raze the sanctuary
And pitch our[SEQ_SPLITTER] evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or[SEQ_SPLITTER] what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her foull[SEQ_SPLITTER]y for those things
That make her good? O, let her [SEQ_SPLITTER]brother live!
Thieves for their robbery have autho[SEQ_SPLITTER]rity
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love[SEQ_SPLITTER] her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And f[SEQ_SPLITTER]east upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
O cunnin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost [SEQ_SPLITTER]bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Is that temptation t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never[SEQ_SPLITTER] could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt and nature,
Once stir my temper; but this virtu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous maid
Subdues me quite. Even till now,
When men[SEQ_SPLITTER] were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.

DUKE VINCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NTIO:
Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]rovost:
I am the provost. What's your will, good f[SEQ_SPLITTER]riar?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bound by my charity and my [SEQ_SPLITTER]blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let[SEQ_SPLITTER] me see them and to make me know
The nature of the[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly[SEQ_SPLITTER].

Provost:
I would do more than that, if more wer[SEQ_SPLITTER]e needful.
Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of [SEQ_SPLITTER]mine,
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]he that got it, sentenced; a young man
More fit to[SEQ_SPLITTER] do another such offence
Than die for this.

DUKE [SEQ_SPLITTER]VINCENTIO:
When must he die?

Provost:
As I do thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nk, to-morrow.
I have provided for you: stay awhil[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
And you shall be conducted.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Re[SEQ_SPLITTER]pent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

JULIET:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

DUKE VI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NCENTIO:
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your[SEQ_SPLITTER] conscience,
And try your penitence, if it be soun[SEQ_SPLITTER]d,
Or hollowly put on.

JULIET:
I'll gladly learn.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love you the man that wrong'd yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u?

JULIET:
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So then it seems your most o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ffenceful act
Was mutually committed?

JULIET:
Mut[SEQ_SPLITTER]ually.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Then was your sin of heavi[SEQ_SPLITTER]er kind than his.

JULIET:
I do confess it, and re[SEQ_SPLITTER]pent it, father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis meet so, da[SEQ_SPLITTER]ughter: but lest you do repent,
As that the sin ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th brought you to this shame,
Which sorrow is alwa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ys towards ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would[SEQ_SPLITTER] not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n fear,--

JULIET:
I do repent me, as it is an evi[SEQ_SPLITTER]l,
And take the shame with joy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]here rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grac[SEQ_SPLITTER]e go with you, Benedicite!

JULIET:
Must die to-mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrow! O injurious love,
That respites me a life, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!

Provos[SEQ_SPLITTER]t:
'Tis pity of him.

ANGELO:
When I would pray an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d think, I think and pray
To several subjects. Hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ven hath my empty words;
Whilst my invention, hear[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my[SEQ_SPLITTER] mouth,
As if I did but only chew his name;
And in[SEQ_SPLITTER] my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conce[SEQ_SPLITTER]ption. The state, whereon I studied
Is like a good[SEQ_SPLITTER] thing, being often read,
Grown fear'd and tedious[SEQ_SPLITTER]; yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man hear me--I [SEQ_SPLITTER]take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle p[SEQ_SPLITTER]lume,
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O for[SEQ_SPLITTER]m,
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]rench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
Let's writ[SEQ_SPLITTER]e good angel on the devil's horn:
'Tis not the dev[SEQ_SPLITTER]il's crest.
How now! who's there?

Servant:
One Is[SEQ_SPLITTER]abel, a sister, desires access to you.

ANGELO:
Te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ach her the way.
O heavens!
Why does my blood thus[SEQ_SPLITTER] muster to my heart,
Making both it unable for its[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf,
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of neces[SEQ_SPLITTER]sary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one[SEQ_SPLITTER] that swoons;
Come all to help him, and so stop th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e air
By which he should revive: and even so
The g[SEQ_SPLITTER]eneral, subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their [SEQ_SPLITTER]own part, and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his [SEQ_SPLITTER]presence, where their untaught love
Must needs app[SEQ_SPLITTER]ear offence.
How now, fair maid?

ISABELLA:
I am c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome to know your pleasure.

ANGELO:
That you might[SEQ_SPLITTER] know it, would much better please me
Than to dema[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.

ISABELLA:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Even so. Heaven keep your honour!

ANGELO:
Yet ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you o[SEQ_SPLITTER]r I yet he must die.

ISABELLA:
Under your sentenc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e?

ANGELO:
Yea.

ISABELLA:
When, I beseech you? t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be [SEQ_SPLITTER]so fitted
That his soul sicken not.

ANGELO:
Ha! f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon [SEQ_SPLITTER]him that hath from nature stolen
A man already mad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin [SEQ_SPLITTER]heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all[SEQ_SPLITTER] as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As [SEQ_SPLITTER]to put metal in restrained means
To make a false o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne.

ISABELLA:
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not[SEQ_SPLITTER] in earth.

ANGELO:
Say you so? then I shall pose [SEQ_SPLITTER]you quickly.
Which had you rather, that the most j[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust law
Now took your brother's life; or, to redee[SEQ_SPLITTER]m him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness[SEQ_SPLITTER]
As she that he hath stain'd?

ISABELLA:
Sir, beli[SEQ_SPLITTER]eve this,
I had rather give my body than my soul.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ANGELO:
I talk not of your soul: our compell'd si[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns
Stand more for number than for accompt.

ISABEL[SEQ_SPLITTER]LA:
How say you?

ANGELO:
Nay, I'll not warrant th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at; for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r to this:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
Might [SEQ_SPLITTER]there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s life?

ISABELLA:
Please you to do't,
I'll take [SEQ_SPLITTER]it as a peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but[SEQ_SPLITTER] charity.

ANGELO:
Pleased you to do't at peril of[SEQ_SPLITTER] your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]ISABELLA:
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
He[SEQ_SPLITTER]aven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
If t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it[SEQ_SPLITTER] added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your [SEQ_SPLITTER]answer.

ANGELO:
Nay, but hear me.
Your sense purs[SEQ_SPLITTER]ues not mine: either you are ignorant,
Or seem so [SEQ_SPLITTER]craftily; and that's not good.

ISABELLA:
Let me b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e ignorant, and in nothing good,
But graciously to[SEQ_SPLITTER] know I am no better.

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom wishes [SEQ_SPLITTER]to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as [SEQ_SPLITTER]these black masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten [SEQ_SPLITTER]times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. But mar[SEQ_SPLITTER]k me;
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Your brother is to die.

ISABELLA:
So.

ANGELO:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to[SEQ_SPLITTER] the law upon that pain.

ISABELLA:
True.

ANGELO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Admit no other way to save his life,--
As I subsc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ribe not that, nor any other,
But in the loss of q[SEQ_SPLITTER]uestion,--that you, his sister,
Finding yourself d[SEQ_SPLITTER]esired of such a person,
Whose credit with the jud[SEQ_SPLITTER]ge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rom the manacles
Of the all-building law; and that[SEQ_SPLITTER] there were
No earthly mean to save him, but that [SEQ_SPLITTER]either
You must lay down the treasures of your bod[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
Wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t would you do?

ISABELLA:
As much for my poor bro[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther as myself:
That is, were I under the terms of[SEQ_SPLITTER] death,
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as [SEQ_SPLITTER]rubies,
And strip myself to death, as to a bed
Tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
My bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]dy up to shame.

ANGELO:
Then must your brother di[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

ISABELLA:
And 'twere the cheaper way:
Better i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t were a brother died at once,
Than that a sister,[SEQ_SPLITTER] by redeeming him,
Should die for ever.

ANGELO:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you[SEQ_SPLITTER] have slander'd so?

ISABELLA:
Ignomy in ransom an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is n[SEQ_SPLITTER]othing kin to foul redemption.

ANGELO:
You seem'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather prov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a [SEQ_SPLITTER]vice.

ISABELLA:
O, pardon me, my lord; it oft fal[SEQ_SPLITTER]ls out,
To have what we would have, we speak not w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat we mean:
I something do excuse the thing I hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
For his advantage that I dearly love.

ANGELO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]We are all frail.

ISABELLA:
Else let my brother d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ie,
If not a feodary, but only he
Owe and succeed [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy weakness.

ANGELO:
Nay, women are frail too.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]ISABELLA:
Ay, as the glasses where they view thems[SEQ_SPLITTER]elves;
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]fiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
For [SEQ_SPLITTER]we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous [SEQ_SPLITTER]to false prints.

ANGELO:
I think it well:
And fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m this testimony of your own sex,--
Since I suppos[SEQ_SPLITTER]e we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake our frames,--let me be bold;
I do arrest your [SEQ_SPLITTER]words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e more, you're none;
If you be one, as you are wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l express'd
By all external warrants, show it now,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
By putting on the destined livery.

ISABELLA:
I h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
Let me entr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eat you speak the former language.

ANGELO:
Plainl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y conceive, I love you.

ISABELLA:
My brother did [SEQ_SPLITTER]love Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall die for[SEQ_SPLITTER] it.

ANGELO:
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me[SEQ_SPLITTER] love.

ISABELLA:
I know your virtue hath a licenc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e in't,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
To[SEQ_SPLITTER] pluck on others.

ANGELO:
Believe me, on mine hon[SEQ_SPLITTER]our,
My words express my purpose.

ISABELLA:
Ha! l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ittle honour to be much believed,
And most pernici[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, Angelo; look for't:
Sign me a present pardon fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r my brother,
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll [SEQ_SPLITTER]tell the world aloud
What man thou art.

ANGELO:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ho will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e austereness of my life,
My vouch against you, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d my place i' the state,
Will so your accusation o[SEQ_SPLITTER]verweigh,
That you shall stifle in your own report[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my [SEQ_SPLITTER]sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious b[SEQ_SPLITTER]lushes,
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy [SEQ_SPLITTER]brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or els[SEQ_SPLITTER]e he must not only die the death,
But thy unkindne[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss shall his death draw out
To lingering sufferanc[SEQ_SPLITTER]e. Answer me to-morrow,
Or, by the affection that [SEQ_SPLITTER]now guides me most,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As[SEQ_SPLITTER] for you,
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur true.

ISABELLA:
To whom should I complain? Did[SEQ_SPLITTER] I tell this,
Who would believe me? O perilous mou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ths,
That bear in them one and the self-same tongu[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
Either of condemnation or approof;
Bidding the [SEQ_SPLITTER]law make court'sy to their will:
Hooking both righ[SEQ_SPLITTER]t and wrong to the appetite,
To follow as it draws[SEQ_SPLITTER]! I'll to my brother:
Though he hath fallen by pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]mpture of the blood,
Yet hath he in him such a min[SEQ_SPLITTER]d of honour.
That, had he twenty heads to tender d[SEQ_SPLITTER]own
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Before his sister should her body stoop
To such ab[SEQ_SPLITTER]horr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, [SEQ_SPLITTER]brother, die:
More than our brother is our chastit[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
And fit [SEQ_SPLITTER]his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

DUKE VINC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENTIO:
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

CLAUDIO:
The miserable have no other medicine
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut only hope:
I've hope to live, and am prepared t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o die.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be absolute for death; eit[SEQ_SPLITTER]her death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Re[SEQ_SPLITTER]ason thus with life:
If I do lose thee, I do lose [SEQ_SPLITTER]a thing
That none but fools would keep: a breath t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That[SEQ_SPLITTER] dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
Hourly [SEQ_SPLITTER]afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
For him th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet runn'st[SEQ_SPLITTER] toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For all the[SEQ_SPLITTER] accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nursed by ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]seness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost[SEQ_SPLITTER] fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provokes[SEQ_SPLITTER]t; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more[SEQ_SPLITTER]. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many [SEQ_SPLITTER]a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou str[SEQ_SPLITTER]ivest to get,
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to stra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nge effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingots[SEQ_SPLITTER] bows,
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
Fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
The m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no soon[SEQ_SPLITTER]er. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, [SEQ_SPLITTER]an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for all[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and [SEQ_SPLITTER]rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor[SEQ_SPLITTER] beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this li[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That makes these odds all even.

CLAUDIO:
I humbl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y thank you.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

I[SEQ_SPLITTER]SABELLA:

Provost:
Who's there? come in: the wish [SEQ_SPLITTER]deserves a welcome.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dear sir, ere[SEQ_SPLITTER] long I'll visit you again.

CLAUDIO:
Most holy si[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, I thank you.

ISABELLA:
My business is a word o[SEQ_SPLITTER]r two with Claudio.

Provost:
And very welcome. Lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ok, signior, here's your sister.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Provost, a word with you.

Provost:
As many as you[SEQ_SPLITTER] please.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bring me to hear them sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]eak, where I may be concealed.

CLAUDIO:
Now, sist[SEQ_SPLITTER]er, what's the comfort?

ISABELLA:
Why,
As all com[SEQ_SPLITTER]forts are; most good, most good indeed.
Lord Angel[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his s[SEQ_SPLITTER]wift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting[SEQ_SPLITTER] leiger:
Therefore your best appointment make with[SEQ_SPLITTER] speed;
To-morrow you set on.

CLAUDIO:
Is there n[SEQ_SPLITTER]o remedy?

ISABELLA:
None, but such remedy as, to [SEQ_SPLITTER]save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain.

CLAUDIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
But is there any?

ISABELLA:
Yes, brother, you ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y live:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If[SEQ_SPLITTER] you'll implore it, that will free your life,
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]fetter you till death.

CLAUDIO:
Perpetual durance[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

ISABELLA:
Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restra[SEQ_SPLITTER]int,
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]a determined scope.

CLAUDIO:
But in what nature?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ISABELLA:
In such a one as, you consenting to't,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd leave you naked.

CLAUDIO:
Let me know the poin[SEQ_SPLITTER]t.

ISABELLA:
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I qu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perp[SEQ_SPLITTER]etual honour. Darest thou die?
The sense of death [SEQ_SPLITTER]is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle, that[SEQ_SPLITTER] we tread upon,
In corporal sufferance finds a pan[SEQ_SPLITTER]g as great
As when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO:
Why giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution [SEQ_SPLITTER]fetch
From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
I wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll encounter darkness as a bride,
And hug it in mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne arms.

ISABELLA:
There spake my brother; there [SEQ_SPLITTER]my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou must die:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life[SEQ_SPLITTER]
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips yout[SEQ_SPLITTER]h i' the head and follies doth emmew
As falcon dot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h the fowl, is yet a devil
His filth within being [SEQ_SPLITTER]cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.

CLA[SEQ_SPLITTER]UDIO:
The prenzie Angelo!

ISABELLA:
O, 'tis the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]unning livery of hell,
The damned'st body to inves[SEQ_SPLITTER]t and cover
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Cl[SEQ_SPLITTER]audio?
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou mig[SEQ_SPLITTER]htst be freed.

CLAUDIO:
O heavens! it cannot be.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ISABELLA:
Yes, he would give't thee, from this ra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nk offence,
So to offend him still. This night's t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or [SEQ_SPLITTER]else thou diest to-morrow.

CLAUDIO:
Thou shalt no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t do't.

ISABELLA:
O, were it but my life,
I'ld th[SEQ_SPLITTER]row it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a p[SEQ_SPLITTER]in.

CLAUDIO:
Thanks, dear Isabel.

ISABELLA:
Be r[SEQ_SPLITTER]eady, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

CLAUDIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Yes. Has he affections in him,
That thus can make [SEQ_SPLITTER]him bite the law by the nose,
When he would force [SEQ_SPLITTER]it? Sure, it is no sin,
Or of the deadly seven, it[SEQ_SPLITTER] is the least.

ISABELLA:
Which is the least?

CLA[SEQ_SPLITTER]UDIO:
If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Why w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fine[SEQ_SPLITTER]d? O Isabel!

ISABELLA:
What says my brother?

CLA[SEQ_SPLITTER]UDIO:
Death is a fearful thing.

ISABELLA:
And sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]med life a hateful.

CLAUDIO:
Ay, but to die, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]go we know not where;
To lie in cold obstruction a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A k[SEQ_SPLITTER]neaded clod; and the delighted spirit
To bathe in [SEQ_SPLITTER]fiery floods, or to reside
In thrilling region of [SEQ_SPLITTER]thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd in the viewless[SEQ_SPLITTER] winds,
And blown with restless violence round abo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Of[SEQ_SPLITTER] those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine [SEQ_SPLITTER]howling: 'tis too horrible!
The weariest and most [SEQ_SPLITTER]loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury and im[SEQ_SPLITTER]prisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what[SEQ_SPLITTER] we fear of death.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Sweet sister, let me live:
What sin you do to sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve a brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the dee[SEQ_SPLITTER]d so far
That it becomes a virtue.

ISABELLA:
O yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]ilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a [SEQ_SPLITTER]kind of incest, to take life
From thine own sister[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip[SEQ_SPLITTER] of wilderness
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y defiance!
Die, perish! Might but my bending down[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]'ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word[SEQ_SPLITTER] to save thee.

CLAUDIO:
Nay, hear me, Isabel.

IS[SEQ_SPLITTER]ABELLA:
O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental[SEQ_SPLITTER], but a trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself a [SEQ_SPLITTER]bawd:
'Tis best thou diest quickly.

CLAUDIO:
O he[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar me, Isabella!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Vouchsafe a word[SEQ_SPLITTER], young sister, but one word.

ISABELLA:
What is y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our will?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Might you dispense with[SEQ_SPLITTER] your leisure, I would by and
by have some speech [SEQ_SPLITTER]with you: the satisfaction I
would require is like[SEQ_SPLITTER]wise your own benefit.

ISABELLA:
I have no superf[SEQ_SPLITTER]luous leisure; my stay must be
stolen out of other[SEQ_SPLITTER] affairs; but I will attend you awhile.

DUKE VINC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENTIO:
Son, I have overheard what hath passed betw[SEQ_SPLITTER]een you
and your sister. Angelo had never the purp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ose to
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of [SEQ_SPLITTER]her
virtue to practise his judgment with the dispo[SEQ_SPLITTER]sition
of natures: she, having the truth of honour[SEQ_SPLITTER] in her,
hath made him that gracious denial which [SEQ_SPLITTER]he is most
glad to receive. I am confessor to Ange[SEQ_SPLITTER]lo, and I
know this to be true; therefore prepare [SEQ_SPLITTER]yourself to
death: do not satisfy your resolution [SEQ_SPLITTER]with hopes
that are fallible: tomorrow you must di[SEQ_SPLITTER]e; go to
your knees and make ready.

CLAUDIO:
Let [SEQ_SPLITTER]me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
with [SEQ_SPLITTER]life that I will sue to be rid of it.

DUKE VINCEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]TIO:
Hold you there: farewell.
Provost, a word wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h you!

Provost:
What's your will, father

DUKE VI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NCENTIO:
That now you are come, you will be gone. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Leave me
awhile with the maid: my mind promises wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Provost:
In good time.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The hand[SEQ_SPLITTER] that hath made you fair hath made you good:
the g[SEQ_SPLITTER]oodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief[SEQ_SPLITTER] in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
your co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mplexion, shall keep the body of it ever
fair. The[SEQ_SPLITTER] assault that Angelo hath made to you,
fortune hat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h conveyed to my understanding; and, but
that frai[SEQ_SPLITTER]lty hath examples for his falling, I should
wonder[SEQ_SPLITTER] at Angelo. How will you do to content this
substi[SEQ_SPLITTER]tute, and to save your brother?

ISABELLA:
I am no[SEQ_SPLITTER]w going to resolve him: I had rather my
brother di[SEQ_SPLITTER]e by the law than my son should be
unlawfully born[SEQ_SPLITTER]. But, O, how much is the good duke
deceived in An[SEQ_SPLITTER]gelo! If ever he return and I can
speak to him, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]will open my lips in vain, or
discover his governm[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That shall not be much amiss[SEQ_SPLITTER]: Yet, as the matter
now stands, he will avoid you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore[SEQ_SPLITTER] fasten your ear on my
advisings: to the love I ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve in doing good a
remedy presents itself. I do ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke myself believe
that you may most uprighteously [SEQ_SPLITTER]do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit; redeem y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our brother from
the angry law; do no stain to you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r own gracious
person; and much please the absent [SEQ_SPLITTER]duke, if
peradventure he shall ever return to have[SEQ_SPLITTER] hearing of
this business.

ISABELLA:
Let me hear [SEQ_SPLITTER]you speak farther. I have spirit to do
anything th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

DU[SEQ_SPLITTER]KE VINCENTIO:
Virtue is bold, and goodness never f[SEQ_SPLITTER]earful. Have
you not heard speak of Mariana, the s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ister of
Frederick the great soldier who miscarrie[SEQ_SPLITTER]d at sea?

ISABELLA:
I have heard of the lady, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] good words went with her name.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]he should this Angelo have married; was affianced
[SEQ_SPLITTER]to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between[SEQ_SPLITTER]
which time of the contract and limit of the
solem[SEQ_SPLITTER]nity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ving in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sist[SEQ_SPLITTER]er. But mark how heavily this befell to the
poor g[SEQ_SPLITTER]entlewoman: there she lost a noble and
renowned br[SEQ_SPLITTER]other, in his love toward her ever most
kind and n[SEQ_SPLITTER]atural; with him, the portion and sinew of
her for[SEQ_SPLITTER]tune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate[SEQ_SPLITTER] husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

ISABELLA:
Can[SEQ_SPLITTER] this be so? did Angelo so leave her?

DUKE VINCEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]TIO:
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hem
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]etending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet[SEQ_SPLITTER]
wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears[SEQ_SPLITTER],
is washed with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
What a merit were it in death to take this poor m[SEQ_SPLITTER]aid
from the world! What corruption in this life, [SEQ_SPLITTER]that
it will let this man live! But how out of thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s can she avail?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is a rupture [SEQ_SPLITTER]that you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not o[SEQ_SPLITTER]nly saves your brother, but keeps
you from dishono[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur in doing it.

ISABELLA:
Show me how, good fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This forenamed maid hath yet i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n her the continuance
of her first affection: his [SEQ_SPLITTER]unjust unkindness, that
in all reason should have [SEQ_SPLITTER]quenched her love, hath,
like an impediment in the[SEQ_SPLITTER] current, made it more
violent and unruly. Go you [SEQ_SPLITTER]to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a plausible o[SEQ_SPLITTER]bedience; agree with
his demands to the point; onl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y refer yourself to
this advantage, first, that yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur stay with him may
not be long; that the time ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]y have all shadow and
silence in it; and the place[SEQ_SPLITTER] answer to convenience.
This being granted in cour[SEQ_SPLITTER]se,--and now follows
all,--we shall advise this wr[SEQ_SPLITTER]onged maid to stead up
your appointment, go in you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r place; if the encounter
acknowledge itself herea[SEQ_SPLITTER]fter, it may compel him to
her recompense: and her[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, by this, is your brother
saved, your honour unt[SEQ_SPLITTER]ainted, the poor Mariana
advantaged, and the corru[SEQ_SPLITTER]pt deputy scaled. The maid
will I frame and make f[SEQ_SPLITTER]it for his attempt. If you
think well to carry thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s as you may, the doubleness
of the benefit defend[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the deceit from reproof.
What think you of it?

[SEQ_SPLITTER]ISABELLA:
The image of it gives me content already[SEQ_SPLITTER]; and I
trust it will grow to a most prosperous pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]rfection.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It lies much in your ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]lding up. Haste you speedily
to Angelo: if for thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s night he entreat you to his
bed, give him promis[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of satisfaction. I will
presently to Saint Luke'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s: there, at the moated
grange, resides this dejec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ted Mariana. At that
place call upon me; and dispa[SEQ_SPLITTER]tch with Angelo, that
it may be quickly.

ISABELLA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d father.

ELBOW:
Nay, if there be no remedy for i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, but that you will
needs buy and sell men and wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]men like beasts, we
shall have all the world drink[SEQ_SPLITTER] brown and white bastard.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O heave[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns! what stuff is here

POMPEY:
'Twas never merry [SEQ_SPLITTER]world since, of two usuries, the
merriest was put [SEQ_SPLITTER]down, and the worser allowed by
order of law a fur[SEQ_SPLITTER]red gown to keep him warm; and
furred with fox and[SEQ_SPLITTER] lamb-skins too, to signify, that
craft, being ric[SEQ_SPLITTER]her than innocency, stands for the facing.

ELBOW:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar[SEQ_SPLITTER].

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you, good brother father. W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat offence hath
this man made you, sir?

ELBOW:
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]arry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
[SEQ_SPLITTER]take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found[SEQ_SPLITTER]
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
[SEQ_SPLITTER]sent to the deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Fie, sirrah! [SEQ_SPLITTER]a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest [SEQ_SPLITTER]to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but[SEQ_SPLITTER] think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
Fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]om such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
From their [SEQ_SPLITTER]abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, arr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay myself, and live.
Canst thou believe thy living[SEQ_SPLITTER] is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go m[SEQ_SPLITTER]end.

POMPEY:
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir; but yet,
sir, I would prove--

DUKE VINCENTIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is rude beast will profit.

ELBOW:
He must before [SEQ_SPLITTER]the deputy, sir; he has given him
warning: the dep[SEQ_SPLITTER]uty cannot abide a whoremaster: if
he be a whoremo[SEQ_SPLITTER]nger, and comes before him, he were
as good go a m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ile on his errand.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That we were a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll, as some would seem to be,
From our faults, as [SEQ_SPLITTER]faults from seeming, free!

ELBOW:
His neck will c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome to your waist,--a cord, sir.

POMPEY:
I spy co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
friend[SEQ_SPLITTER] of mine.

LUCIO:
How now, noble Pompey! What, at [SEQ_SPLITTER]the wheels of
Caesar? art thou led in triumph? Wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, is there
none of Pygmalion's images, newly made[SEQ_SPLITTER] woman, to be
had now, for putting the hand in the[SEQ_SPLITTER] pocket and
extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]? What
sayest thou to this tune, matter and method[SEQ_SPLITTER]? Is't
not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What saye[SEQ_SPLITTER]st
thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which [SEQ_SPLITTER]is
the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
[SEQ_SPLITTER]trick of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Still thus, and thus[SEQ_SPLITTER]; still worse!

LUCIO:
How doth my dear morsel, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y mistress? Procures she
still, ha?

POMPEY:
Troth[SEQ_SPLITTER], sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
is [SEQ_SPLITTER]herself in the tub.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis good; it is [SEQ_SPLITTER]the right of it; it must be
so: ever your fresh wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore and your powdered bawd:
an unshunned consequen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce; it must be so. Art going
to prison, Pompey?

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]OMPEY:
Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis not amis[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
sent thee thither. [SEQ_SPLITTER]For debt, Pompey? or how?

ELBOW:
For being a bawd[SEQ_SPLITTER], for being a bawd.

LUCIO:
Well, then, imprison h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im: if imprisonment be the
due of a bawd, why, 'ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]s his right: bawd is he
doubtless, and of antiquit[SEQ_SPLITTER]y too; bawd-born.
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to the prison,
Pompey: you will turn good husban[SEQ_SPLITTER]d now, Pompey; you
will keep the house.

POMPEY:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

LU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CIO:
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the[SEQ_SPLITTER] wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bonda[SEQ_SPLITTER]ge: If
you take it not patiently, why, your mettle[SEQ_SPLITTER] is the
more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you.

LUCIO:
Does Bridge[SEQ_SPLITTER]t paint still, Pompey, ha?

ELBOW:
Come your ways,[SEQ_SPLITTER] sir; come.

POMPEY:
You will not bail me, then, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir?

LUCIO:
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroa[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, friar?
what news?

ELBOW:
Come your ways, sir; [SEQ_SPLITTER]come.

LUCIO:
Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
What news,[SEQ_SPLITTER] friar, of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know none.[SEQ_SPLITTER] Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO:
Some say he is wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th the Emperor of Russia; other
some, he is in Rom[SEQ_SPLITTER]e: but where is he, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
LUCIO:
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to s[SEQ_SPLITTER]teal from
the state, and usurp the beggary he was [SEQ_SPLITTER]never born
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his ab[SEQ_SPLITTER]sence; he
puts transgression to 't.

DUKE VINCENTI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
He does well in 't.

LUCIO:
A little more lenit[SEQ_SPLITTER]y to lechery would do no harm in
him: something to[SEQ_SPLITTER]o crabbed that way, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is [SEQ_SPLITTER]too general a vice, and severity must cure it.

LU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CIO:
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great ki[SEQ_SPLITTER]ndred;
it is well allied: but it is impossible to [SEQ_SPLITTER]extirp
it quite, friar, till eating and drinking b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e put
down. They say this Angelo was not made by m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an and
woman after this downright way of creation:[SEQ_SPLITTER] is it
true, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How shoul[SEQ_SPLITTER]d he be made, then?

LUCIO:
Some report a sea-maid[SEQ_SPLITTER] spawned him; some, that he
was begot between two [SEQ_SPLITTER]stock-fishes. But it is
certain that when he makes[SEQ_SPLITTER] water his urine is
congealed ice; that I know to [SEQ_SPLITTER]be true: and he is a
motion generative; that's inf[SEQ_SPLITTER]allible.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pleasant, sir, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd speak apace.

LUCIO:
Why, what a ruthless thing[SEQ_SPLITTER] is this in him, for the
rebellion of a codpiece t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o take away the life of a
man! Would the duke that[SEQ_SPLITTER] is absent have done this?
Ere he would have hange[SEQ_SPLITTER]d a man for the getting a
hundred bastards, he wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld have paid for the nursing
a thousand: he had so[SEQ_SPLITTER]me feeling of the sport: he
knew the service, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]that instructed him to mercy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ever heard the absent duke much detected for
women[SEQ_SPLITTER]; he was not inclined that way.

LUCIO:
O, sir, yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u are deceived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis not possible[SEQ_SPLITTER].

LUCIO:
Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ifty; and
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-[SEQ_SPLITTER]dish: the
duke had crotchets in him. He would be d[SEQ_SPLITTER]runk too;
that let me inform you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO:
Sir, I was an i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nward of his. A shy fellow was the
duke: and I bel[SEQ_SPLITTER]ieve I know the cause of his
withdrawing.

DUKE VI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NCENTIO:
What, I prithee, might be the cause?

LUC[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked withi[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nderstand, the greater file of the subject held th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
duke to be wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! why, no [SEQ_SPLITTER]question but he was.

LUCIO:
A very superficial, i[SEQ_SPLITTER]gnorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Eithe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e very stream of his life and the business he hath[SEQ_SPLITTER]
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a bett[SEQ_SPLITTER]er
proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his[SEQ_SPLITTER] own
bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
e[SEQ_SPLITTER]nvious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
There[SEQ_SPLITTER]fore you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e more it is much darkened in your malice.

LUCIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Sir, I know him, and I love him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith
dearer love.

LUCIO:
Come, sir, I know what I [SEQ_SPLITTER]know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I can hardly believe that, [SEQ_SPLITTER]since you know not what
you speak. But, if ever th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e duke return, as our
prayers are he may, let me d[SEQ_SPLITTER]esire you to make your
answer before him. If it be[SEQ_SPLITTER] honest you have spoke,
you have courage to mainta[SEQ_SPLITTER]in it: I am bound to call
upon you; and, I pray yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u, your name?

LUCIO:
Sir, my name is Lucio; well [SEQ_SPLITTER]known to the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He shall know [SEQ_SPLITTER]you better, sir, if I may live to
report you.

LUC[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
I fear you not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, you hope t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he duke will return no more; or you
imagine me too[SEQ_SPLITTER] unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
can do you li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ttle harm; you'll forswear this again.

LUCIO:
I'l[SEQ_SPLITTER]l be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
friar.[SEQ_SPLITTER] But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
Claudio d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ie to-morrow or no?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why should he[SEQ_SPLITTER] die, sir?

LUCIO:
Why? For filling a bottle with [SEQ_SPLITTER]a tundish. I would
the duke we talk of were return[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed again: the
ungenitured agent will unpeople the [SEQ_SPLITTER]province with
continency; sparrows must not build [SEQ_SPLITTER]in his
house-eaves, because they are lecherous. Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e duke
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; [SEQ_SPLITTER]he would
never bring them to light: would he were [SEQ_SPLITTER]returned!
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for unt[SEQ_SPLITTER]russing.
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for[SEQ_SPLITTER] me. The
duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutt[SEQ_SPLITTER]on on
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee,
he would mouth with a beggar, though she sme[SEQ_SPLITTER]lt brown
bread and garlic: say that I said so. Far[SEQ_SPLITTER]ewell.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No might nor greatness in [SEQ_SPLITTER]mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumn[SEQ_SPLITTER]y
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]who comes here?

ESCALUS:
Go; away with her to pri[SEQ_SPLITTER]son!

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Good my lord, be good to [SEQ_SPLITTER]me; your honour is accounted
a merciful man; good [SEQ_SPLITTER]my lord.

ESCALUS:
Double and treble admonition, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd still forfeit in
the same kind! This would make[SEQ_SPLITTER] mercy swear and play
the tyrant.

Provost:
A bawd[SEQ_SPLITTER] of eleven years' continuance, may it please
your [SEQ_SPLITTER]honour.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
My lord, this is one L[SEQ_SPLITTER]ucio's information against me.
Mistress Kate Keepd[SEQ_SPLITTER]own was with child by him in the
duke's time; he p[SEQ_SPLITTER]romised her marriage: his child
is a year and a qu[SEQ_SPLITTER]arter old, come Philip and Jacob:
I have kept it m[SEQ_SPLITTER]yself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!

ESC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ALUS:
That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let[SEQ_SPLITTER] him be
called before us. Away with her to prison![SEQ_SPLITTER] Go to;
no more words.
Provost, my brother Angelo [SEQ_SPLITTER]will not be altered;
Claudio must die to-morrow: l[SEQ_SPLITTER]et him be furnished
with divines, and have all cha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ritable preparation.
if my brother wrought by my p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ity, it should not be
so with him.

Provost:
So pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ease you, this friar hath been with him, and
advis[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed him for the entertainment of death.

ESCALUS:
G[SEQ_SPLITTER]ood even, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bliss and [SEQ_SPLITTER]goodness on you!

ESCALUS:
Of whence are you?

DUK[SEQ_SPLITTER]E VINCENTIO:
Not of this country, though my chance[SEQ_SPLITTER] is now
To use it for my time: I am a brother
Of g[SEQ_SPLITTER]racious order, late come from the See
In special b[SEQ_SPLITTER]usiness from his holiness.

ESCALUS:
What news abr[SEQ_SPLITTER]oad i' the world?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
None, but that [SEQ_SPLITTER]there is so great a fever on
goodness, that the di[SEQ_SPLITTER]ssolution of it must cure it:
novelty is only in r[SEQ_SPLITTER]equest; and it is as dangerous
to be aged in any k[SEQ_SPLITTER]ind of course, as it is virtuous
to be constant in[SEQ_SPLITTER] any undertaking. There is scarce
truth enough ali[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve to make societies secure; but
security enough t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o make fellowships accurst: much
upon this riddle [SEQ_SPLITTER]runs the wisdom of the world. This
news is old eno[SEQ_SPLITTER]ugh, yet it is every day's news. I
pray you, sir, [SEQ_SPLITTER]of what disposition was the duke?

ESCALUS:
One th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at, above all other strifes, contended
especially [SEQ_SPLITTER]to know himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What pleasure wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s he given to?

ESCALUS:
Rather rejoicing to see a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nother merry, than merry at
any thing which profes[SEQ_SPLITTER]sed to make him rejoice: a
gentleman of all temper[SEQ_SPLITTER]ance. But leave we him to
his events, with a praye[SEQ_SPLITTER]r they may prove prosperous;
and let me desire to [SEQ_SPLITTER]know how you find Claudio
prepared. I am made to u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nderstand that you have
lent him visitation.

DUKE[SEQ_SPLITTER] VINCENTIO:
He professes to have received no sinis[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter measure
from his judge, but most willingly hum[SEQ_SPLITTER]bles himself
to the determination of justice: yet [SEQ_SPLITTER]had he framed
to himself, by the instruction of hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s frailty, many
deceiving promises of life; which [SEQ_SPLITTER]I by my good
leisure have discredited to him, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]now is he
resolved to die.

ESCALUS:
You have paid[SEQ_SPLITTER] the heavens your function, and the
prisoner the v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ery debt of your calling. I have
laboured for the [SEQ_SPLITTER]poor gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modest[SEQ_SPLITTER]y: but my brother justice have I
found so severe, [SEQ_SPLITTER]that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed Ju[SEQ_SPLITTER]stice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
If his own life answer the[SEQ_SPLITTER] straitness of his
proceeding, it shall become him[SEQ_SPLITTER] well; wherein if he
chance to fail, he hath sente[SEQ_SPLITTER]nced himself.

ESCALUS:
I am going to visit the pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]isoner. Fare you well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Peace be w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith you!
He who the sword of heaven will bear
Shou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself to kno[SEQ_SPLITTER]w,
Grace to stand, and virtue go;
More nor less to[SEQ_SPLITTER] others paying
Than by self-offences weighing.
Sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]me to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of[SEQ_SPLITTER] his own liking!
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what may man wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hin him hide,
Though angel on the outward side!
Ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w may likeness made in crimes,
Making practise on [SEQ_SPLITTER]the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most[SEQ_SPLITTER] ponderous and substantial things!
Craft against v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice I must apply:
With Angelo to-night shall lie
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]is old betrothed but despised;
So disguise shall, [SEQ_SPLITTER]by the disguised,
Pay with falsehood false exactin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g,
And perform an old contracting.


MARIANA:
Brea[SEQ_SPLITTER]k off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
Here co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mes a man of comfort, whose advice
Hath often stil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l'd my brawling discontent.
I cry you mercy, sir; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and well could wish
You had not found me here so m[SEQ_SPLITTER]usical:
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
My mi[SEQ_SPLITTER]rth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.

DUKE [SEQ_SPLITTER]VINCENTIO:
'Tis good; though music oft hath such a[SEQ_SPLITTER] charm
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
for [SEQ_SPLITTER]me here to-day? much upon this time have
I promise[SEQ_SPLITTER]d here to meet.

MARIANA:
You have not been inquir[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed after:
I have sat here all day.

DUKE VINCENTIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I do constantly believe you. The time is come ev[SEQ_SPLITTER]en
now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay
be I will call upon you anon, for some advantag[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to yourself.

MARIANA:
I am always bound to you.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Very well met, and well come.
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at is the news from this good deputy?

ISABELLA:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hath a garden circummured with brick,
Whose west[SEQ_SPLITTER]ern side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vi[SEQ_SPLITTER]neyard is a planched gate,
That makes his opening [SEQ_SPLITTER]with this bigger key:
This other doth command a li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ttle door
Which from the vineyard to the garden le[SEQ_SPLITTER]ads;
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy m[SEQ_SPLITTER]iddle of the night
To call upon him.

DUKE VINCENT[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ISABELLA:
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon'[SEQ_SPLITTER]t:
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
In a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ction all of precept, he did show me
The way twice[SEQ_SPLITTER] o'er.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are there no other tokens
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISA[SEQ_SPLITTER]BELLA:
No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant[SEQ_SPLITTER] comes with me along,
That stays upon me, whose pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]rsuasion is
I come about my brother.

DUKE VINCENT[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
'Tis well borne up.
I have not yet made known [SEQ_SPLITTER]to Mariana
A word of this. What, ho! within! come [SEQ_SPLITTER]forth!
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]he comes to do you good.

ISABELLA:
I do desire th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e like.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Do you persuade yourself [SEQ_SPLITTER]that I respect you?

MARIANA:
Good friar, I know y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou do, and have found it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Take, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen, this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tory ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisu[SEQ_SPLITTER]re: but make haste;
The vaporous night approaches.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

MARIANA:
Will't please you walk aside?

DUKE VIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]CENTIO:
O place and greatness! millions of false e[SEQ_SPLITTER]yes
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
Run wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h these false and most contrarious quests
Upon thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] doings: thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the fat[SEQ_SPLITTER]her of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ncies.
Welcome, how agreed?

ISABELLA:
She'll take[SEQ_SPLITTER] the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it[SEQ_SPLITTER].

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not my consent,
But my en[SEQ_SPLITTER]treaty too.

ISABELLA:
Little have you to say
When[SEQ_SPLITTER] you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember[SEQ_SPLITTER] now my brother.'

MARIANA:
Fear me not.

DUKE VIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]CENTIO:
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
He is your husband on a pre-contract:
To bring yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u thus together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justic[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit. C[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]the's to sow.

Provost:
Come hither, sirrah. Can y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou cut off a man's head?

POMPEY:
If the man be a [SEQ_SPLITTER]bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
married man, [SEQ_SPLITTER]he's his wife's head, and I can never
cut off a wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]man's head.

Provost:
Come, sir, leave me your sna[SEQ_SPLITTER]tches, and yield me a
direct answer. To-morrow mor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ning are to die Claudio
and Barnardine. Here is in[SEQ_SPLITTER] our prison a common
executioner, who in his offic[SEQ_SPLITTER]e lacks a helper: if
you will take it on you to as[SEQ_SPLITTER]sist him, it shall
redeem you from your gyves; if [SEQ_SPLITTER]not, you shall have
your full time of imprisonment[SEQ_SPLITTER] and your deliverance
with an unpitied whipping, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or you have been a
notorious bawd.

POMPEY:
Sir, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
but [SEQ_SPLITTER]yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld be glad to receive some instruction from my
fe[SEQ_SPLITTER]llow partner.

Provost:
What, ho! Abhorson! Where'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s Abhorson, there?

ABHORSON:
Do you call, sir?

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]rovost:
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-m[SEQ_SPLITTER]orrow in
your execution. If you think it meet, com[SEQ_SPLITTER]pound with
him by the year, and let him abide here[SEQ_SPLITTER] with you; if
not, use him for the present and dis[SEQ_SPLITTER]miss him. He
cannot plead his estimation with you;[SEQ_SPLITTER] he hath been a bawd.

ABHORSON:
A bawd, sir? fie [SEQ_SPLITTER]upon him! he will discredit our mystery.

Provost:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will tur[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
the scale.

POMPEY:
Pray, sir, by your good favo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur,--for surely, sir, a
good favour you have, but [SEQ_SPLITTER]that you have a hanging
look,--do you call, sir, y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our occupation a mystery?

ABHORSON:
Ay, sir; a my[SEQ_SPLITTER]stery

POMPEY:
Painting, sir, I have heard say, is[SEQ_SPLITTER] a mystery; and
your whores, sir, being members of[SEQ_SPLITTER] my occupation,
using painting, do prove my occupa[SEQ_SPLITTER]tion a mystery:
but what mystery there should be i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n hanging, if I
should be hanged, I cannot imagine[SEQ_SPLITTER].

ABHORSON:
Sir, it is a mystery.

POMPEY:
Proof?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ABHORSON:
Every true man's apparel fits your thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ef: if it be
too little for your thief, your true [SEQ_SPLITTER]man thinks it
big enough; if it be too big for you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r thief, your
thief thinks it little enough: so ev[SEQ_SPLITTER]ery true man's
apparel fits your thief.

Provost:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Are you agreed?

POMPEY:
Sir, I will serve him; fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r I do find your hangman is
a more penitent trade [SEQ_SPLITTER]than your bawd; he doth
oftener ask forgiveness.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]Provost:
You, sirrah, provide your block and your [SEQ_SPLITTER]axe
to-morrow four o'clock.

ABHORSON:
Come on, ba[SEQ_SPLITTER]wd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.

POM[SEQ_SPLITTER]PEY:
I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you[SEQ_SPLITTER] have
occasion to use me for your own turn, you sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all find
me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindnes[SEQ_SPLITTER]s I owe you
a good turn.

Provost:
Call hither Bar[SEQ_SPLITTER]nardine and Claudio:
The one has my pity; not a jo[SEQ_SPLITTER]t the other,
Being a murderer, though he were my b[SEQ_SPLITTER]rother.
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] death:
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rrow
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardin[SEQ_SPLITTER]e?

CLAUDIO:
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltle[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller's [SEQ_SPLITTER]bones:
He will not wake.

Provost:
Who can do good[SEQ_SPLITTER] on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself.
But, hark, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at noise?
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
By and[SEQ_SPLITTER] by.
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the [SEQ_SPLITTER]most gentle Claudio.
Welcome father.

DUKE VINCENT[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
E[SEQ_SPLITTER]nvelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

Provost:
None, since the curfew rung.

DUKE VIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]CENTIO:
Not Isabel?

Provost:
No.

DUKE VINCENTIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
They will, then, ere't be long.

Provost:
What co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mfort is for Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There's som[SEQ_SPLITTER]e in hope.

Provost:
It is a bitter deputy.

DUKE [SEQ_SPLITTER]VINCENTIO:
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Even with the stroke and line of his great justice[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in hims[SEQ_SPLITTER]elf which he spurs on his power
To qualify in othe[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs: were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]en were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Now are they come.
This is a gentle provost: sel[SEQ_SPLITTER]dom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with [SEQ_SPLITTER]haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these[SEQ_SPLITTER] strokes.

Provost:
There he must stay until the o[SEQ_SPLITTER]fficer
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.

DUKE[SEQ_SPLITTER] VINCENTIO:
Have you no countermand for Claudio ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]t,
But he must die to-morrow?

Provost:
None, sir,[SEQ_SPLITTER] none.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As near the dawning, provo[SEQ_SPLITTER]st, as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.

Pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ovost:
Happily
You something know; yet I believe t[SEQ_SPLITTER]here comes
No countermand; no such example have we[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Lord Ang[SEQ_SPLITTER]elo hath to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
This is his lordship's man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]here comes Claudio's pardon.

Messenger:

Provost:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I shall obey him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost:
I to[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
in [SEQ_SPLITTER]mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
putting[SEQ_SPLITTER]-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it b[SEQ_SPLITTER]efore.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Pray you, let's hear.

Pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]vost:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is that Barnardine who[SEQ_SPLITTER] is to be executed in the
afternoon?

Provost:
A B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t is a prisoner nine years old.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow came it that the absent duke had not either
del[SEQ_SPLITTER]ivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
have [SEQ_SPLITTER]heard it was ever his manner to do so.

Provost:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]is friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
i[SEQ_SPLITTER]ndeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d
Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.

DUKE V[SEQ_SPLITTER]INCENTIO:
It is now apparent?

Provost:
Most manif[SEQ_SPLITTER]est, and not denied by himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath he born himself penitently in prison? how
seem[SEQ_SPLITTER]s he to be touched?

Provost:
A man that apprehend[SEQ_SPLITTER]s death no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sleep;[SEQ_SPLITTER] careless, reckless, and fearless
of what's past, [SEQ_SPLITTER]present, or to come; insensible of
mortality, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]desperately mortal.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He wants advi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce.

Provost:
He will hear none: he hath evermore [SEQ_SPLITTER]had the liberty
of the prison; give him leave to e[SEQ_SPLITTER]scape hence, he
would not: drunk many times a day,[SEQ_SPLITTER] if not many days
entirely drunk. We have very oft[SEQ_SPLITTER] awaked him, as if
to carry him to execution, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]showed him a seeming
warrant for it: it hath not m[SEQ_SPLITTER]oved him at all.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
More of him anon[SEQ_SPLITTER]. There is written in your brow,
provost, honesty [SEQ_SPLITTER]and constancy: if I read it not
truly, my ancient [SEQ_SPLITTER]skill beguiles me; but, in the
boldness of my cunn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing, I will lay myself in hazard.
Claudio, whom he[SEQ_SPLITTER]re you have warrant to execute, is
no greater forf[SEQ_SPLITTER]eit to the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced him.[SEQ_SPLITTER] To make you understand this in a
manifested effec[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, I crave but four days' respite;
for the which y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou are to do me both a present and a
dangerous cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtesy.

Provost:
Pray, sir, in what?

DUKE VINCENT[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
In the delaying death.

Provost:
A lack, how m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay I do it, having the hour limited,
and an expres[SEQ_SPLITTER]s command, under penalty, to deliver
his head in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he view of Angelo? I may make my case
as Claudio's[SEQ_SPLITTER], to cross this in the smallest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
inst[SEQ_SPLITTER]ructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
be[SEQ_SPLITTER] this morning executed, and his head born to Angel[SEQ_SPLITTER]o.

Provost:
Angelo hath seen them both, and will [SEQ_SPLITTER]discover the favour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, death's a[SEQ_SPLITTER] great disguiser; and you may add to it.
Shave the[SEQ_SPLITTER] head, and tie the beard; and say it was
the desir[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of the penitent to be so bared before his
death:[SEQ_SPLITTER] you know the course is common. If any thing
fall [SEQ_SPLITTER]to you upon this, more than thanks and good
fortun[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
again[SEQ_SPLITTER]st it with my life.

Provost:
Pardon me, good fath[SEQ_SPLITTER]er; it is against my oath.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?

Provost:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To him, and to his substitutes.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou will think you have made no offence, if the duk[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
avouch the justice of your dealing?

Provost:
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t what likelihood is in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not[SEQ_SPLITTER] a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ersuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
fur[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
du[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ignet is not strange to you.

Provost:
I know them[SEQ_SPLITTER] both.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The contents of this is th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e return of the duke: you
shall anon over-read it [SEQ_SPLITTER]at your pleasure; where you
shall find, within the[SEQ_SPLITTER]se two days he will be here.
This is a thing that [SEQ_SPLITTER]Angelo knows not; for he this
very day receives le[SEQ_SPLITTER]tters of strange tenor;
perchance of the duke's de[SEQ_SPLITTER]ath; perchance entering
into some monastery; but, [SEQ_SPLITTER]by chance, nothing of what
is writ. Look, the unfo[SEQ_SPLITTER]lding star calls up the
shepherd. Put not yourself[SEQ_SPLITTER] into amazement how these
things should be: all di[SEQ_SPLITTER]fficulties are but easy
when they are known. Call [SEQ_SPLITTER]your executioner, and off
with Barnardine's head: [SEQ_SPLITTER]I will give him a present
shrift and advise him fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r a better place. Yet you
are amazed; but this sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll absolutely resolve you.
Come away; it is almost[SEQ_SPLITTER] clear dawn.

POMPEY:
I am as well acquainted here[SEQ_SPLITTER] as I was in our house
of profession: one would th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ink it were Mistress
Overdone's own house, for her[SEQ_SPLITTER]e be many of her old
customers. First, here's youn[SEQ_SPLITTER]g Master Rash; he's in
for a commodity of brown pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]per and old ginger,
ninescore and seventeen pounds[SEQ_SPLITTER]; of which he made
five marks, ready money: marry,[SEQ_SPLITTER] then ginger was not
much in request, for the old [SEQ_SPLITTER]women were all dead.
Then is there here one Master[SEQ_SPLITTER] Caper, at the suit of
Master Three-pile the merce[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, for some four suits of
peach-coloured satin, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich now peaches him a
beggar. Then have we here yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ung Dizy, and young
Master Deep-vow, and Master Co[SEQ_SPLITTER]pperspur, and Master
Starve-lackey the rapier and [SEQ_SPLITTER]dagger man, and young
Drop-heir that killed lusty [SEQ_SPLITTER]Pudding, and Master
Forthlight the tilter, and bra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve Master Shooty the
great traveller, and wild Hal[SEQ_SPLITTER]f-can that stabbed
Pots, and, I think, forty more;[SEQ_SPLITTER] all great doers in
our trade, and are now 'for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e Lord's sake.'

ABHORSON:
Sirrah, bring Barnardin[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hither.

POMPEY:
Master Barnardine! you must ris[SEQ_SPLITTER]e and be hanged.
Master Barnardine!

ABHORSON:
Wha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, ho, Barnardine!

BARNARDINE:

POMPEY:
Your frie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds, sir; the hangman. You must be so
good, sir, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o rise and be put to death.

BARNARDINE:

ABHORSON[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]OMPEY:
Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are[SEQ_SPLITTER]
executed, and sleep afterwards.

ABHORSON:
Go in [SEQ_SPLITTER]to him, and fetch him out.

POMPEY:
He is coming, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.

ABHOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]SON:
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

POMPEY:
V[SEQ_SPLITTER]ery ready, sir.

BARNARDINE:
How now, Abhorson? wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at's the news with you?

ABHORSON:
Truly, sir, I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould desire you to clap into your
prayers; for, lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ok you, the warrant's come.

BARNARDINE:
You rogue[SEQ_SPLITTER], I have been drinking all night; I am not
fitted [SEQ_SPLITTER]for 't.

POMPEY:
O, the better, sir; for he that d[SEQ_SPLITTER]rinks all night,
and is hanged betimes in the morn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing, may sleep the
sounder all the next day.

ABHO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RSON:
Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly fathe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r: do
we jest now, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir[SEQ_SPLITTER], induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort[SEQ_SPLITTER]
you and pray with you.

BARNARDINE:
Friar, not I [SEQ_SPLITTER]I have been drinking hard all night,
and I will ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve more time to prepare me, or they
shall beat out[SEQ_SPLITTER] my brains with billets: I will not
consent to die[SEQ_SPLITTER] this day, that's certain.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER], you must: and therefore I beseech you
Look forwa[SEQ_SPLITTER]rd on the journey you shall go.

BARNARDINE:
I swe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar I will not die to-day for any man's
persuasion.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But hear you.

BARNARDINE:
Not a[SEQ_SPLITTER] word: if you have any thing to say to me,
come to[SEQ_SPLITTER] my ward; for thence will not I to-day.

DUKE VINC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENTIO:
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After[SEQ_SPLITTER] him, fellows; bring him to the block.

Provost:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

DUKE VINCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NTIO:
A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Provost:
Here in the prison, father,
There died [SEQ_SPLITTER]this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most[SEQ_SPLITTER] notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do om[SEQ_SPLITTER]it
This reprobate till he were well inclined;
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re like to Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, 'tis an ac[SEQ_SPLITTER]cident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently[SEQ_SPLITTER]; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e done,
And sent according to command; whiles I
Pe[SEQ_SPLITTER]rsuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

Provost[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
This shall be done, good father, presently.
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]Barnardine must die this afternoon:
And how shall [SEQ_SPLITTER]we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at might come
If he were known alive?

DUKE VINCEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]TIO:
Let this be done.
Put them in secret holds, b[SEQ_SPLITTER]oth Barnardine and Claudio:
Ere twice the sun hath[SEQ_SPLITTER] made his journal greeting
To the under generation[SEQ_SPLITTER], you shall find
Your safety manifested.

Provost:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I am your free dependant.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick,[SEQ_SPLITTER] dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
Now will I[SEQ_SPLITTER] write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall [SEQ_SPLITTER]bear them, whose contents
Shall witness to him I a[SEQ_SPLITTER]m near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am bound
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To mee[SEQ_SPLITTER]t me at the consecrated fount
A league below the c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ity; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-b[SEQ_SPLITTER]alanced form,
We shall proceed with Angelo.

Provo[SEQ_SPLITTER]st:
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

DUKE [SEQ_SPLITTER]VINCENTIO:
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]For I would commune with you of such things
That w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ant no ear but yours.

Provost:
I'll make all spee[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.

ISABELLA:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The tongue of Isabe[SEQ_SPLITTER]l. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon [SEQ_SPLITTER]be come hither:
But I will keep her ignorant of he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]When it is least expected.

ISABELLA:
Ho, by your [SEQ_SPLITTER]leave!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good morning to you, fair [SEQ_SPLITTER]and gracious daughter.

ISABELLA:
The better, give[SEQ_SPLITTER]n me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my[SEQ_SPLITTER] brother's pardon?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He hath releas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed him, Isabel, from the world:
His head is off an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d sent to Angelo.

ISABELLA:
Nay, but it is not so[SEQ_SPLITTER].

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is no other: show your wisdo[SEQ_SPLITTER]m, daughter,
In your close patience.

ISABELLA:
O,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

DUKE VINCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NTIO:
You shall not be admitted to his sight.

ISA[SEQ_SPLITTER]BELLA:
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious[SEQ_SPLITTER] world! most damned Angelo!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This [SEQ_SPLITTER]nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it th[SEQ_SPLITTER]erefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithf[SEQ_SPLITTER]ul verity:
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry[SEQ_SPLITTER] your eyes;
One of our convent, and his confessor,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]otice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to mee[SEQ_SPLITTER]t him at the gates,
There to give up their power. [SEQ_SPLITTER]If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t I would wish it go,
And you shall have your boso[SEQ_SPLITTER]m on this wretch,
Grace of the duke, revenges to y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our heart,
And general honour.

ISABELLA:
I am dir[SEQ_SPLITTER]ected by you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This letter, then, [SEQ_SPLITTER]to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the d[SEQ_SPLITTER]uke's return:
Say, by this token, I desire his com[SEQ_SPLITTER]pany
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]urs
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
Accus[SEQ_SPLITTER]e him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed by a sacred vow
And shall be absent. Wend you w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith this letter:
Command these fretting waters fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy [SEQ_SPLITTER]order,
If I pervert your course. Who's here?

LUCI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
Good even. Friar, where's the provost?

DUKE VI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NCENTIO:
Not within, sir.

LUCIO:
O pretty Isabell[SEQ_SPLITTER]a, I am pale at mine heart to see
thine eyes so re[SEQ_SPLITTER]d: thou must be patient. I am fain
to dine and sup[SEQ_SPLITTER] with water and bran; I dare not for
my head fill [SEQ_SPLITTER]my belly; one fruitful meal would set
me to 't. Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t they say the duke will be here
to-morrow. By my [SEQ_SPLITTER]troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
if the old fan[SEQ_SPLITTER]tastical duke of dark corners had been
at home, he[SEQ_SPLITTER] had lived.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, the duke is marv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ellous little beholding to your
reports; but the b[SEQ_SPLITTER]est is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO:
Friar, thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]knowest not the duke so well as I do:
he's a bette[SEQ_SPLITTER]r woodman than thou takest him for.

DUKE VINCENTI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

LUCIO:
Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
I can[SEQ_SPLITTER] tell thee pretty tales of the duke.

DUKE VINCENT[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
You have told me too many of him already, sir,[SEQ_SPLITTER] if
they be true; if not true, none were enough.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]LUCIO:
I was once before him for getting a wench w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith child.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Did you such a thing?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
LUCIO:
Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar it;
they would else have married me to the rott[SEQ_SPLITTER]en medlar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, your company is f[SEQ_SPLITTER]airer than honest. Rest you well.

LUCIO:
By my tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]oth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
if bawdy[SEQ_SPLITTER] talk offend you, we'll have very little of
it. Na[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.

ESC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ALUS:
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched ot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her.

ANGELO:
In most uneven and distracted manner[SEQ_SPLITTER]. His actions
show much like to madness: pray heav[SEQ_SPLITTER]en his wisdom be
not tainted! And why meet him at [SEQ_SPLITTER]the gates, and
redeliver our authorities there

ES[SEQ_SPLITTER]CALUS:
I guess not.

ANGELO:
And why should we pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]claim it in an hour before his
entering, that if a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ny crave redress of injustice,
they should exhibit[SEQ_SPLITTER] their petitions in the street?

ESCALUS:
He shows[SEQ_SPLITTER] his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
compla[SEQ_SPLITTER]ints, and to deliver us from devices
hereafter, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ich shall then have no power to stand
against us.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ANGELO:
Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed[SEQ_SPLITTER] betimes
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house:[SEQ_SPLITTER] give
notice to such men of sort and suit as are t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o meet
him.

ESCALUS:
I shall, sir. Fare you well.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ANGELO:
Good night.
This deed unshapes me quite,[SEQ_SPLITTER] makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings. [SEQ_SPLITTER]A deflower'd maid!
And by an eminent body that enf[SEQ_SPLITTER]orced
The law against it! But that her tender sham[SEQ_SPLITTER]e
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
For m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y authority bears of a credent bulk,
That no parti[SEQ_SPLITTER]cular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the [SEQ_SPLITTER]breather. He should have lived,
Save that riotous [SEQ_SPLITTER]youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to[SEQ_SPLITTER] come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishon[SEQ_SPLITTER]our'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he[SEQ_SPLITTER] had lived!
A lack, when once our grace we have fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rgot,
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
These letters at fit time del[SEQ_SPLITTER]iver me
The provost knows our purpose and our plot[SEQ_SPLITTER].
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd hold you ever to our special drift;
Though some[SEQ_SPLITTER]times you do blench from this to that,
As cause do[SEQ_SPLITTER]th minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
And tell h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im where I stay: give the like notice
To Valentinu[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the[SEQ_SPLITTER] trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
FRIAR PETER:
It shall be speeded well.

DUKE VINC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENTIO:
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good [SEQ_SPLITTER]haste:
Come, we will walk. There's other of our fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iends
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ISABELLA:
To speak so indirectly I am loath:
I wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to v[SEQ_SPLITTER]eil full purpose.

MARIANA:
Be ruled by him.

ISAB[SEQ_SPLITTER]ELLA:
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]e speak against me on the adverse side,
I should n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitt[SEQ_SPLITTER]er to sweet end.

MARIANA:
I would Friar Peter--

[SEQ_SPLITTER]ISABELLA:
O, peace! the friar is come.

FRIAR PETE[SEQ_SPLITTER]R:
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere you may have such vantage on the duke,
He shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]he generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gat[SEQ_SPLITTER]es, and very near upon
The duke is entering: there[SEQ_SPLITTER]fore, hence, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My very worthy[SEQ_SPLITTER] cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, [SEQ_SPLITTER]we are glad to see you.

ANGELO:
Happy return be t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o your royal grace!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many and hear[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of [SEQ_SPLITTER]you; and we hear
Such goodness of your justice, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hanks,
Forerunning more requital.

ANGELO:
You mak[SEQ_SPLITTER]e my bonds still greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, your[SEQ_SPLITTER] desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
To loc[SEQ_SPLITTER]k it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserve[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'g[SEQ_SPLITTER]ainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Gi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve me your hand,
And let the subject see, to make [SEQ_SPLITTER]them know
That outward courtesies would fain procl[SEQ_SPLITTER]aim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ust walk by us on our other hand;
And good support[SEQ_SPLITTER]ers are you.

FRIAR PETER:
Now is your time: speak[SEQ_SPLITTER] loud and kneel before him.

ISABELLA:
Justice, O [SEQ_SPLITTER]royal duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd, I wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld fain have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishon[SEQ_SPLITTER]our not your eye
By throwing it on any other objec[SEQ_SPLITTER]t
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]given me justice, justice, justice, justice!

DUKE[SEQ_SPLITTER] VINCENTIO:
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? [SEQ_SPLITTER]be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce:
Reveal yourself to him.

ISABELLA:
O worthy du[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
Hear [SEQ_SPLITTER]me yourself; for that which I must speak
Must eith[SEQ_SPLITTER]er punish me, not being believed,
Or wring redress[SEQ_SPLITTER] from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!

ANGELO:
My l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
She hath b[SEQ_SPLITTER]een a suitor to me for her brother
Cut off by cour[SEQ_SPLITTER]se of justice,--

ISABELLA:
By course of justice!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ANGELO:
And she will speak most bitterly and stra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nge.

ISABELLA:
Most strange, but yet most truly, [SEQ_SPLITTER]will I speak:
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not st[SEQ_SPLITTER]range?
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite[SEQ_SPLITTER], a virgin-violator;
Is it not strange and strange[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, it is ten times strange.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]ISABELLA:
It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s all as true as it is strange:
Nay, it is ten tim[SEQ_SPLITTER]es true; for truth is truth
To the end of reckonin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with her! Poor soul,
She [SEQ_SPLITTER]speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

ISABELLA:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
There [SEQ_SPLITTER]is another comfort than this world,
That thou negl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ect me not, with that opinion
That I am touch'd wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th madness! Make not impossible
That which but see[SEQ_SPLITTER]ms unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked[SEQ_SPLITTER]'st caitiff on the ground,
May seem as shy, as gra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve, as just, as absolute
As Angelo; even so may An[SEQ_SPLITTER]gelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, form[SEQ_SPLITTER]s,
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]f he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Had I m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore name for badness.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By mine hon[SEQ_SPLITTER]esty,
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
Her[SEQ_SPLITTER] madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a de[SEQ_SPLITTER]pendency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in mad[SEQ_SPLITTER]ness.

ISABELLA:
O gracious duke,
Harp not on that[SEQ_SPLITTER], nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let[SEQ_SPLITTER] your reason serve
To make the truth appear where [SEQ_SPLITTER]it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true.

DUKE[SEQ_SPLITTER] VINCENTIO:
Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more[SEQ_SPLITTER] lack of reason. What would you say?

ISABELLA:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ct of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by A[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngelo:
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger,-[SEQ_SPLITTER]-

LUCIO:
That's I, an't like your grace:
I came t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o her from Claudio, and desired her
To try her gra[SEQ_SPLITTER]cious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's pardon.

ISABELLA:
That's he indeed.

DUKE VIN[SEQ_SPLITTER]CENTIO:
You were not bid to speak.

LUCIO:
No, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

DUKE VINC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENTIO:
I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f it: and when you have
A business for yourself, p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ray heaven you then
Be perfect.

LUCIO:
I warrant [SEQ_SPLITTER]your honour.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The warrants for you[SEQ_SPLITTER]rself; take heed to't.

ISABELLA:
This gentleman t[SEQ_SPLITTER]old somewhat of my tale,--

LUCIO:
Right.

DUKE VI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NCENTIO:
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To speak before your time. Proceed.

ISABELLA:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--

DUKE VI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NCENTIO:
That's somewhat madly spoken.

ISABELLA:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.

DUKE VINC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENTIO:
Mended again. The matter; proceed.

ISABELL[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
In brief, to set the needless process by,
How I[SEQ_SPLITTER] persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much[SEQ_SPLITTER] length,--the vile conclusion
I now begin with gri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ef and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate [SEQ_SPLITTER]lust,
Release my brother; and, after much debateme[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
His[SEQ_SPLITTER] purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r brother's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is most li[SEQ_SPLITTER]kely!

ISABELLA:
O, that it were as like as it is [SEQ_SPLITTER]true!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By heaven, fond wretch, tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u knowist not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art[SEQ_SPLITTER] suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practise. [SEQ_SPLITTER]First, his integrity
Stands without blemish. Next,[SEQ_SPLITTER] it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he [SEQ_SPLITTER]should pursue
Faults proper to himself: if he had [SEQ_SPLITTER]so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy brother by [SEQ_SPLITTER]himself
And not have cut him off. Some one hath se[SEQ_SPLITTER]t you on:
Confess the truth, and say by whose advi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce
Thou camest here to complain.

ISABELLA:
And is[SEQ_SPLITTER] this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Ke[SEQ_SPLITTER]ep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Unfold th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance! Heav[SEQ_SPLITTER]en shield your grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd,[SEQ_SPLITTER] hence unbelieved go!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I know you'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! S[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous br[SEQ_SPLITTER]eath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be[SEQ_SPLITTER] a practise.
Who knew of Your intent and coming hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther?

ISABELLA:
One that I would were here, Friar[SEQ_SPLITTER] Lodowick.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A ghostly father, beli[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke. Who knows that Lodowick?

LUCIO:
My lord, I kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like the m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an: had he been lay, my lord
For certain words he [SEQ_SPLITTER]spake against your grace
In your retirement, I had[SEQ_SPLITTER] swinged him soundly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Words again[SEQ_SPLITTER]st me? this is a good friar, belike!
And to set on[SEQ_SPLITTER] this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! [SEQ_SPLITTER]Let this friar be found.

LUCIO:
But yesternight, [SEQ_SPLITTER]my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the pri[SEQ_SPLITTER]son: a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow.

FRIAR P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ETER:
Blessed be your royal grace!
I have stood by[SEQ_SPLITTER], my lord, and I have heard
Your royal ear abused.[SEQ_SPLITTER] First, hath this woman
Most wrongfully accused yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur substitute,
Who is as free from touch or soil w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith her
As she from one ungot.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We[SEQ_SPLITTER] did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick[SEQ_SPLITTER] that she speaks of?

FRIAR PETER:
I know him for [SEQ_SPLITTER]a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary[SEQ_SPLITTER] meddler,
As he's reported by this gentleman;
And,[SEQ_SPLITTER] on my trust, a man that never yet
Did, as he vouc[SEQ_SPLITTER]hes, misreport your grace.

LUCIO:
My lord, most v[SEQ_SPLITTER]illanously; believe it.

FRIAR PETER:
Well, he in [SEQ_SPLITTER]time may come to clear himself;
But at this instan[SEQ_SPLITTER]t he is sick my lord,
Of a strange fever. Upon his[SEQ_SPLITTER] mere request,
Being come to knowledge that there [SEQ_SPLITTER]was complaint
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I[SEQ_SPLITTER] hither,
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth[SEQ_SPLITTER] know
Is true and false; and what he with his oath[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And all probation will make up full clear,
Whenso[SEQ_SPLITTER]ever he's convented. First, for this woman.
To jus[SEQ_SPLITTER]tify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and persona[SEQ_SPLITTER]lly accused,
Her shall you hear disproved to her e[SEQ_SPLITTER]yes,
Till she herself confess it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Good friar, let's hear it.
Do you not smile at th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is, Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched [SEQ_SPLITTER]fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In[SEQ_SPLITTER] this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own [SEQ_SPLITTER]cause. Is this the witness, friar?
First, let her [SEQ_SPLITTER]show her face, and after speak.

MARIANA:
Pardon, [SEQ_SPLITTER]my lord; I will not show my face
Until my husband [SEQ_SPLITTER]bid me.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What, are you married?

M[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARIANA:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are you a ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]id?

MARIANA:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A wido[SEQ_SPLITTER]w, then?

MARIANA:
Neither, my lord.

DUKE VINCENT[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow[SEQ_SPLITTER], nor wife?

LUCIO:
My lord, she may be a punk; fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r many of them are
neither maid, widow, nor wife.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
DUKE VINCENTIO:
Silence that fellow: I would he h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad some cause
To prattle for himself.

LUCIO:
Well[SEQ_SPLITTER], my lord.

MARIANA:
My lord; I do confess I ne'er[SEQ_SPLITTER] was married;
And I confess besides I am no maid:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not [SEQ_SPLITTER]that ever he knew me.

LUCIO:
He was drunk then, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y lord: it can be no better.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For [SEQ_SPLITTER]the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!

L[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCIO:
Well, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This is no w[SEQ_SPLITTER]itness for Lord Angelo.

MARIANA:
Now I come to't [SEQ_SPLITTER]my lord
She that accuses him of fornication,
In se[SEQ_SPLITTER]lf-same manner doth accuse my husband,
And charges[SEQ_SPLITTER] him my lord, with such a time
When I'll depose I [SEQ_SPLITTER]had him in mine arms
With all the effect of love.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
ANGELO:
Charges she more than me?

MARIANA:
Not t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you say your husb[SEQ_SPLITTER]and.

MARIANA:
Why, just, my lord, and that is Ang[SEQ_SPLITTER]elo,
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my bod[SEQ_SPLITTER]y,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

AN[SEQ_SPLITTER]GELO:
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

MARIANA:
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which once t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou sworest was worth the looking on;
This is the [SEQ_SPLITTER]hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d in thine; this is the body
That took away the m[SEQ_SPLITTER]atch from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garde[SEQ_SPLITTER]n-house
In her imagined person.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
K[SEQ_SPLITTER]now you this woman?

LUCIO:
Carnally, she says.

D[SEQ_SPLITTER]UKE VINCENTIO:
Sirrah, no more!

LUCIO:
Enough, my[SEQ_SPLITTER] lord.

ANGELO:
My lord, I must confess I know thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s woman:
And five years since there was some speec[SEQ_SPLITTER]h of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was br[SEQ_SPLITTER]oke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Came short of composition, but in chief
For that h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which[SEQ_SPLITTER] time of five years
I never spake with her, saw he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]MARIANA:
Noble prince,
As there comes light from h[SEQ_SPLITTER]eaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in [SEQ_SPLITTER]truth and truth in virtue,
I am affianced this man[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s wife as strongly
As words could make up vows: a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's[SEQ_SPLITTER] garden-house
He knew me as a wife. As this is tru[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees
Or else[SEQ_SPLITTER] for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!

AN[SEQ_SPLITTER]GELO:
I did but smile till now:
Now, good my lord,[SEQ_SPLITTER] give me the scope of justice
My patience here is [SEQ_SPLITTER]touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women a[SEQ_SPLITTER]re no more
But instruments of some more mightier m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ember
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To find this practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith my heart
And punish them to your height of ple[SEQ_SPLITTER]asure.
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious wom[SEQ_SPLITTER]an,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou th[SEQ_SPLITTER]y oaths,
Though they would swear down each particu[SEQ_SPLITTER]lar saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and [SEQ_SPLITTER]credit
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Esc[SEQ_SPLITTER]alus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
Ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e is another friar that set them on;
Let him be se[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt for.

FRIAR PETER:
Would he were here, my lord![SEQ_SPLITTER] for he indeed
Hath set the women on to this compl[SEQ_SPLITTER]aint:
Your provost knows the place where he abides[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And he may fetch him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go do it i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nstantly.
And you, my noble and well-warranted cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]sin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
D[SEQ_SPLITTER]o with your injuries as seems you best,
In any cha[SEQ_SPLITTER]stisement: I for a while will leave you;
But stir [SEQ_SPLITTER]not you till you have well determined
Upon these s[SEQ_SPLITTER]landerers.

ESCALUS:
My lord, we'll do it throughl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
Fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

LUCIO:
'Cu[SEQ_SPLITTER]cullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
but [SEQ_SPLITTER]in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
villa[SEQ_SPLITTER]nous speeches of the duke.

ESCALUS:
We shall entr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eat you to abide here till he come and
enforce the[SEQ_SPLITTER]m against him: we shall find this friar a
notable [SEQ_SPLITTER]fellow.

LUCIO:
As any in Vienna, on my word.

ESC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ALUS:
Call that same Isabel here once again; I wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld speak with her.
Pray you, my lord, give me leav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to question; you
shall see how I'll handle her.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
LUCIO:
Not better than he, by her own report.

ES[SEQ_SPLITTER]CALUS:
Say you?

LUCIO:
Marry, sir, I think, if yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u handled her privately,
she would sooner confess:[SEQ_SPLITTER] perchance, publicly,
she'll be ashamed.

ESCALUS:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I will go darkly to work with her.

LUCIO:
That's[SEQ_SPLITTER] the way; for women are light at midnight.

ESCALU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies [SEQ_SPLITTER]all
that you have said.

LUCIO:
My lord, here come[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the rascal I spoke of; here with
the provost.

E[SEQ_SPLITTER]SCALUS:
In very good time: speak not you to him ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll we
call upon you.

LUCIO:
Mum.

ESCALUS:
Come, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir: did you set these women on to slander
Lord An[SEQ_SPLITTER]gelo? they have confessed you did.

DUKE VINCENTIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
'Tis false.

ESCALUS:
How! know you where you ar[SEQ_SPLITTER]e?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Respect to your great place! a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing throne!
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear[SEQ_SPLITTER] me speak.

ESCALUS:
The duke's in us; and we will[SEQ_SPLITTER] hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.

DUKE VINC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENTIO:
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come [SEQ_SPLITTER]you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cau[SEQ_SPLITTER]se gone too. The duke's unjust,
Thus to retort you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villa[SEQ_SPLITTER]in's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.

LUCIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

ESCALU[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Is't[SEQ_SPLITTER] not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accu[SEQ_SPLITTER]se this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
And in the [SEQ_SPLITTER]witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain? an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d then to glance from him
To the duke himself, to [SEQ_SPLITTER]tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to the rac[SEQ_SPLITTER]k with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we[SEQ_SPLITTER] will know his purpose.
What 'unjust'!

DUKE VINCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NTIO:
Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch[SEQ_SPLITTER] this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My busine[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss in this state
Made me a looker on here in Vienn[SEQ_SPLITTER]a,
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Ti[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
But [SEQ_SPLITTER]faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]tand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much[SEQ_SPLITTER] in mock as mark.

ESCALUS:
Slander to the state! [SEQ_SPLITTER]Away with him to prison!

ANGELO:
What can you vou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t you did tell us of?

LUCIO:
'Tis he, my lord. Co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me hither, goodman baldpate:
do you know me?

DUKE[SEQ_SPLITTER] VINCENTIO:
I remember you, sir, by the sound of y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our voice: I
met you at the prison, in the absence[SEQ_SPLITTER] of the duke.

LUCIO:
O, did you so? And do you re[SEQ_SPLITTER]member what you said of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Most notedly, sir.

LUCIO:
Do you so, sir? And wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s the duke a fleshmonger, a
fool, and a coward, as[SEQ_SPLITTER] you then reported him to be?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You[SEQ_SPLITTER] must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
m[SEQ_SPLITTER]uch more, much worse.

LUCIO:
O thou damnable fell[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow! Did not I pluck thee by the
nose for thy speec[SEQ_SPLITTER]hes?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I protest I love the duke as[SEQ_SPLITTER] I love myself.

ANGELO:
Hark, how the villain wou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld close now, after his
treasonable abuses!

ESCAL[SEQ_SPLITTER]US:
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away[SEQ_SPLITTER] with
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th him
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let h[SEQ_SPLITTER]im
speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and[SEQ_SPLITTER]
with the other confederate companion!

DUKE VINCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NTIO:

ANGELO:
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
LUCIO:
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir![SEQ_SPLITTER] Why, you
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]oded, must
you? Show your knave's visage, with a p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ox to you!
show your sheep-biting face, and be han[SEQ_SPLITTER]ged an hour!
Will't not off?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
Firs[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
Sneak [SEQ_SPLITTER]not away, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord anon. Lay hold on him.

LUCIO:
This may prove [SEQ_SPLITTER]worse than hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
O my[SEQ_SPLITTER] dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltine[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I percei[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon[SEQ_SPLITTER] my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer session h[SEQ_SPLITTER]old upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own co[SEQ_SPLITTER]nfession:
Immediate sentence then and sequent deat[SEQ_SPLITTER]h
Is all the grace I beg.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to t[SEQ_SPLITTER]his woman?

ANGELO:
I was, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
Do [SEQ_SPLITTER]you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]m here again. Go with him, provost.

ESCALUS:
My l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the[SEQ_SPLITTER] strangeness of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, [SEQ_SPLITTER]Isabel.
Your friar is now your prince: as I was th[SEQ_SPLITTER]en
Advertising and holy to your business,
Not chan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ging heart with habit, I am still
Attorney'd at yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur service.

ISABELLA:
O, give me pardon,
That I, [SEQ_SPLITTER]your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown[SEQ_SPLITTER] sovereignty!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pardon'd, I[SEQ_SPLITTER]sabel:
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Labouring[SEQ_SPLITTER] to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash [SEQ_SPLITTER]remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be[SEQ_SPLITTER] lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity[SEQ_SPLITTER] of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot [SEQ_SPLITTER]came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th him!
That life is better life, past fearing dea[SEQ_SPLITTER]th,
Than that which lives to fear: make it your co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mfort,
So happy is your brother.

ISABELLA:
I do, [SEQ_SPLITTER]my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For this new-married man[SEQ_SPLITTER] approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath[SEQ_SPLITTER] wrong'd
Your well defended honour, you must pardo[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her,--
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon dependen[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, for your brother's life,--
The very mercy of th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper[SEQ_SPLITTER] tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisu[SEQ_SPLITTER]re;
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEA[SEQ_SPLITTER]SURE.
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hich, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantag[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Clau[SEQ_SPLITTER]dio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Away wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th him!

MARIANA:
O my most gracious lord,
I hope [SEQ_SPLITTER]you will not mock me with a husband.

DUKE VINCENT[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thou[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e knew you, might reproach your life
And choke you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r good to come; for his possessions,
Although by c[SEQ_SPLITTER]onfiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow[SEQ_SPLITTER] you withal,
To buy you a better husband.

MARIANA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
O my dear lord,
I crave no other, nor no better [SEQ_SPLITTER]man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Never crave him; we are defi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nitive.

MARIANA:
Gentle my liege,--

DUKE VINCENT[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to [SEQ_SPLITTER]death!
Now, sir, to you.

MARIANA:
O my good lord![SEQ_SPLITTER] Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knees, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o do you service.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Against all sen[SEQ_SPLITTER]se you do importune her:
Should she kneel down in [SEQ_SPLITTER]mercy of this fact,
Her brother's ghost his paved [SEQ_SPLITTER]bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.

MA[SEQ_SPLITTER]RIANA:
Isabel,
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e;
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all[SEQ_SPLITTER].
They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, for the most, become much more the better
For b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eing a little bad: so may my husband.
O Isabel, wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll you not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He dies f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or Claudio's death.

ISABELLA:
Most bounteous sir,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As[SEQ_SPLITTER] if my brother lived: I partly think
A due sinceri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty govern'd his deeds,
Till he did look on me: sin[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but j[SEQ_SPLITTER]ustice,
In that he did the thing for which he died[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad int[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent,
And must be buried but as an intent
That peri[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
Intents[SEQ_SPLITTER] but merely thoughts.

MARIANA:
Merely, my lord.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up[SEQ_SPLITTER], I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Pro[SEQ_SPLITTER]vost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusu[SEQ_SPLITTER]al hour?

Provost:
It was commanded so.

DUKE VINC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENTIO:
Had you a special warrant for the deed?

Pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ovost:
No, my good lord; it was by private message[SEQ_SPLITTER].

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For which I do discharge you of[SEQ_SPLITTER] your office:
Give up your keys.

Provost:
Pardon [SEQ_SPLITTER]me, noble lord:
I thought it was a fault, but knew[SEQ_SPLITTER] it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice;
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should[SEQ_SPLITTER] by private order else have died,
I have reserved [SEQ_SPLITTER]alive.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What's he?

Provost:
His n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ame is Barnardine.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I would thou h[SEQ_SPLITTER]adst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let [SEQ_SPLITTER]me look upon him.

ESCALUS:
I am sorry, one so lea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ppear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat [SEQ_SPLITTER]of blood.
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

ANGELO:
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I c[SEQ_SPLITTER]rave death more willingly than mercy;
'Tis my dese[SEQ_SPLITTER]rving, and I do entreat it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Which[SEQ_SPLITTER] is that Barnardine?

Provost:
This, my lord.

DUK[SEQ_SPLITTER]E VINCENTIO:
There was a friar told me of this man[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat apprehends no further than this world,
And squ[SEQ_SPLITTER]arest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
But, [SEQ_SPLITTER]for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
And pra[SEQ_SPLITTER]y thee take this mercy to provide
For better times[SEQ_SPLITTER] to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your h[SEQ_SPLITTER]and. What muffled fellow's that?

Provost:
This is[SEQ_SPLITTER] another prisoner that I saved.
Who should have di[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to C[SEQ_SPLITTER]laudio as himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

LUCIO:
'Faith[SEQ_SPLITTER], my lord. I spoke it but according to the
trick. [SEQ_SPLITTER]If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
had rat[SEQ_SPLITTER]her it would please you I might be whipt.

DUKE VI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NCENTIO:
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Procl[SEQ_SPLITTER]aim it, provost, round about the city.
Is any woma[SEQ_SPLITTER]n wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
As I have heard him[SEQ_SPLITTER] swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with chil[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, let her appear,
And he shall marry her: the nup[SEQ_SPLITTER]tial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

LUCIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore.
Your highness said even now, I made you a duk[SEQ_SPLITTER]e:
good my lord, do not recompense me in making me[SEQ_SPLITTER] a cuckold.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Upon mine honour, tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and the[SEQ_SPLITTER]rewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to pri[SEQ_SPLITTER]son;
And see our pleasure herein executed.

LUCIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hipping, and hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Slandering [SEQ_SPLITTER]a prince deserves it.
She, Claudio, that you wrong[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d, look you restore.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, Angelo:
I have confess'd her and I know her vir[SEQ_SPLITTER]tue.
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]dness:
There's more behind that is more gratulate.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll employ thee in a worthier place.
Forgive him, A[SEQ_SPLITTER]ngelo, that brought you home
The head of Ragozine [SEQ_SPLITTER]for Claudio's:
The offence pardons itself. Dear Is[SEQ_SPLITTER]abel,
I have a motion much imports your good;
Wher[SEQ_SPLITTER]eto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s yours and what is yours is mine.
So, bring us to[SEQ_SPLITTER] our palace; where we'll show
What's yet behind, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat's meet you all should know.

SLY:
I'll pheeze [SEQ_SPLITTER]you, in faith.

Hostess:
A pair of stocks, you rog[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue!

SLY:
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues[SEQ_SPLITTER]; look in
the chronicles; we came in with Richard [SEQ_SPLITTER]Conqueror.
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the wor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld slide: sessa!

Hostess:
You will not pay for th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e glasses you have burst?

SLY:
No, not a denier. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
bed, and warm thee[SEQ_SPLITTER].

Hostess:
I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
[SEQ_SPLITTER]third--borough.

SLY:
Third, or fourth, or fifth b[SEQ_SPLITTER]orough, I'll answer him
by law: I'll not budge an [SEQ_SPLITTER]inch, boy: let him come,
and kindly.

Lord:
Huntsm[SEQ_SPLITTER]an, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
Brach Me[SEQ_SPLITTER]rriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
And couple Clowd[SEQ_SPLITTER]er with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Saw'st thou not, [SEQ_SPLITTER]boy, how Silver made it good
At the hedge-corner, [SEQ_SPLITTER]in the coldest fault?
I would not lose the dog for[SEQ_SPLITTER] twenty pound.

First Huntsman:
Why, Belman is as [SEQ_SPLITTER]good as he, my lord;
He cried upon it at the meres[SEQ_SPLITTER]t loss
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest sce[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt:
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.

Lord[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
I would [SEQ_SPLITTER]esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd look unto them all:
To-morrow I intend to hunt [SEQ_SPLITTER]again.

First Huntsman:
I will, my lord.

Lord:
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breath[SEQ_SPLITTER]e?

Second Huntsman:
He breathes, my lord. Were he[SEQ_SPLITTER] not warm'd with ale,
This were a bed but cold to [SEQ_SPLITTER]sleep so soundly.

Lord:
O monstrous beast! how li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ke a swine he lies!
Grim death, how foul and loath[SEQ_SPLITTER]some is thine image!
Sirs, I will practise on this[SEQ_SPLITTER] drunken man.
What think you, if he were convey'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]to bed,
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is fingers,
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd brave attendants near him when he wakes,
Would [SEQ_SPLITTER]not the beggar then forget himself?

First Huntsma[SEQ_SPLITTER]n:
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.

Se[SEQ_SPLITTER]cond Huntsman:
It would seem strange unto him when[SEQ_SPLITTER] he waked.

Lord:
Even as a flattering dream or wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rthless fancy.
Then take him up and manage well th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e jest:
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
Balm h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is foul head in warm distilled waters
And burn swe[SEQ_SPLITTER]et wood to make the lodging sweet:
Procure me musi[SEQ_SPLITTER]c ready when he wakes,
To make a dulcet and a heav[SEQ_SPLITTER]enly sound;
And if he chance to speak, be ready st[SEQ_SPLITTER]raight
And with a low submissive reverence
Say 'Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at is it your honour will command?'
Let one attend[SEQ_SPLITTER] him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and be[SEQ_SPLITTER]strew'd with flowers,
Another bear the ewer, the t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hird a diaper,
And say 'Will't please your lordshi[SEQ_SPLITTER]p cool your hands?'
Some one be ready with a costl[SEQ_SPLITTER]y suit
And ask him what apparel he will wear;
Anot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her tell him of his hounds and horse,
And that his[SEQ_SPLITTER] lady mourns at his disease:
Persuade him that he [SEQ_SPLITTER]hath been lunatic;
And when he says he is, say tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t he dreams,
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
It will be [SEQ_SPLITTER]pastime passing excellent,
If it be husbanded with[SEQ_SPLITTER] modesty.

First Huntsman:
My lord, I warrant you [SEQ_SPLITTER]we will play our part,
As he shall think by our tr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue diligence
He is no less than what we say he is.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Lord:
Take him up gently and to bed with him;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d each one to his office when he wakes.
Sirrah, go[SEQ_SPLITTER] see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
Belike, some n[SEQ_SPLITTER]oble gentleman that means,
Travelling some journey[SEQ_SPLITTER], to repose him here.
How now! who is it?

Servant[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
An't please your honour, players
That offer serv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ice to your lordship.

Lord:
Bid them come near.
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow, fellows, you are welcome.

Players:
We thank y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our honour.

Lord:
Do you intend to stay with me t[SEQ_SPLITTER]onight?

A Player:
So please your lordship to acce[SEQ_SPLITTER]pt our duty.

Lord:
With all my heart. This fellow[SEQ_SPLITTER] I remember,
Since once he play'd a farmer's eldes[SEQ_SPLITTER]t son:
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so we[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll:
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.

A Playe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r:
I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.

Lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d:
'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
Well, [SEQ_SPLITTER]you are come to me in a happy time;
The rather for[SEQ_SPLITTER] I have some sport in hand
Wherein your cunning ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]n assist me much.
There is a lord will hear you pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay to-night:
But I am doubtful of your modesties;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
For yet hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s honour never heard a play--
You break into some [SEQ_SPLITTER]merry passion
And so offend him; for I tell you, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]irs,
If you should smile he grows impatient.

A Pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ayer:
Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Were he the veriest antic in the world.

Lord:
Go[SEQ_SPLITTER], sirrah, take them to the buttery,
And give them [SEQ_SPLITTER]friendly welcome every one:
Let them want nothing [SEQ_SPLITTER]that my house affords.
Sirrah, go you to Barthol'm[SEQ_SPLITTER]ew my page,
And see him dress'd in all suits like [SEQ_SPLITTER]a lady:
That done, conduct him to the drunkard's c[SEQ_SPLITTER]hamber;
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
Te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll him from me, as he will win my love,
He bear hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]mself with honourable action,
Such as he hath obse[SEQ_SPLITTER]rved in noble ladies
Unto their lords, by them acc[SEQ_SPLITTER]omplished:
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
Wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And say 'Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]at is't your honour will command,
Wherein your lad[SEQ_SPLITTER]y and your humble wife
May show her duty and make [SEQ_SPLITTER]known her love?'
And then with kind embracements, [SEQ_SPLITTER]tempting kisses,
And with declining head into his [SEQ_SPLITTER]bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
To s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee her noble lord restored to health,
Who for this[SEQ_SPLITTER] seven years hath esteem'd him
No better than a po[SEQ_SPLITTER]or and loathsome beggar:
And if the boy have not a[SEQ_SPLITTER] woman's gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
An onion will do well for such a shift,
Which in [SEQ_SPLITTER]a napkin being close convey'd
Shall in despite enf[SEQ_SPLITTER]orce a watery eye.
See this dispatch'd with all th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e haste thou canst:
Anon I'll give thee more instr[SEQ_SPLITTER]uctions.
I know the boy will well usurp the grace,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
I long t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o hear him call the drunkard husband,
And how my m[SEQ_SPLITTER]en will stay themselves from laughter
When they do[SEQ_SPLITTER] homage to this simple peasant.
I'll in to counsel[SEQ_SPLITTER] them; haply my presence
May well abate the over-m[SEQ_SPLITTER]erry spleen
Which otherwise would grow into extrem[SEQ_SPLITTER]es.

SLY:
For God's sake, a pot of small ale.

Fir[SEQ_SPLITTER]st Servant:
Will't please your lordship drink a cu[SEQ_SPLITTER]p of sack?

Second Servant:
Will't please your hon[SEQ_SPLITTER]our taste of these conserves?

Third Servant:
What[SEQ_SPLITTER] raiment will your honour wear to-day?

SLY:
I am [SEQ_SPLITTER]Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
'lordsh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ip:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if
you giv[SEQ_SPLITTER]e me any conserves, give me conserves of
beef: ne'[SEQ_SPLITTER]er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I
have no mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re doublets than backs, no more stockings
than leg[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,
sometimes mor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
toes look t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hrough the over-leather.

Lord:
Heaven cease this [SEQ_SPLITTER]idle humour in your honour!
O, that a mighty man o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f such descent,
Of such possessions and so high es[SEQ_SPLITTER]teem,
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!

SL[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y:
What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christoph[SEQ_SPLITTER]er
Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a
p[SEQ_SPLITTER]edlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation [SEQ_SPLITTER]a
bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinke[SEQ_SPLITTER]r?
Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, [SEQ_SPLITTER]if
she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ence
on the score for sheer ale, score me up for t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he
lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not
b[SEQ_SPLITTER]estraught: here's--

Third Servant:
O, this it is [SEQ_SPLITTER]that makes your lady mourn!

Second Servant:
O, th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is is it that makes your servants droop!

Lord:
He[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]s beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
O noble lor[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, bethink thee of thy birth,
Call home thy ancien[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thoughts from banishment
And banish hence these [SEQ_SPLITTER]abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do atte[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd on thee,
Each in his office ready at thy beck.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
And twen[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty caged nightingales do sing:
Or wilt thou sleep?[SEQ_SPLITTER] we'll have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the lustful bed
On purpose trimm'd up for Semira[SEQ_SPLITTER]mis.
Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the groun[SEQ_SPLITTER]d:
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Do[SEQ_SPLITTER]st thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
Ab[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds[SEQ_SPLITTER] shall make the welkin answer them
And fetch shril[SEQ_SPLITTER]l echoes from the hollow earth.

First Servant:
Sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
As[SEQ_SPLITTER] breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.

Second[SEQ_SPLITTER] Servant:
Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee straight
Adonis painted by a running brook,
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d Cytherea all in sedges hid,
Which seem to move a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd wanton with her breath,
Even as the waving sedg[SEQ_SPLITTER]es play with wind.

Lord:
We'll show thee Io as sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]e was a maid,
And how she was beguiled and surpris[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed,
As lively painted as the deed was done.

Third[SEQ_SPLITTER] Servant:
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she blee[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds,
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
So wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rkmanly the blood and tears are drawn.

Lord:
Thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] art a lord, and nothing but a lord:
Thou hast a l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this wani[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng age.

First Servant:
And till the tears that sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]e hath shed for thee
Like envious floods o'er-run [SEQ_SPLITTER]her lovely face,
She was the fairest creature in t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he world;
And yet she is inferior to none.

SLY:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]m I a lord? and have I such a lady?
Or do I dream?[SEQ_SPLITTER] or have I dream'd till now?
I do not sleep: I see[SEQ_SPLITTER], I hear, I speak;
I smell sweet savours and I fee[SEQ_SPLITTER]l soft things:
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
Well, bring o[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur lady hither to our sight;
And once again, a pot[SEQ_SPLITTER] o' the smallest ale.

Second Servant:
Will't plea[SEQ_SPLITTER]se your mightiness to wash your hands?
O, how we j[SEQ_SPLITTER]oy to see your wit restored!
O, that once more you[SEQ_SPLITTER] knew but what you are!
These fifteen years you ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve been in a dream;
Or when you waked, so waked as[SEQ_SPLITTER] if you slept.

SLY:
These fifteen years! by my fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, a goodly nap.
But did I never speak of all that[SEQ_SPLITTER] time?

First Servant:
O, yes, my lord, but very i[SEQ_SPLITTER]dle words:
For though you lay here in this goodly [SEQ_SPLITTER]chamber,
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of d[SEQ_SPLITTER]oor;
And rail upon the hostess of the house;
And s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay you would present her at the leet,
Because she [SEQ_SPLITTER]brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
Sometimes[SEQ_SPLITTER] you would call out for Cicely Hacket.

SLY:
Ay, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he woman's maid of the house.

Third Servant:
Why,[SEQ_SPLITTER] sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
Nor no s[SEQ_SPLITTER]uch men as you have reckon'd up,
As Stephen Sly an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d did John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y Pimpernell
And twenty more such names and men as[SEQ_SPLITTER] these
Which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!

ALL:
Ame[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.

SLY:
I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Page:
How fares my noble lord?

SLY:
Marry, I far[SEQ_SPLITTER]e well for here is cheer enough.
Where is my wife?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Page:
Here, noble lord: what is thy will with he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r?

SLY:
Are you my wife and will not call me husb[SEQ_SPLITTER]and?
My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodm[SEQ_SPLITTER]an.

Page:
My husband and my lord, my lord and hus[SEQ_SPLITTER]band;
I am your wife in all obedience.

SLY:
I kno[SEQ_SPLITTER]w it well. What must I call her?

Lord:
Madam.

SL[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y:
Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?

Lord:
'Madam,' and[SEQ_SPLITTER] nothing else: so lords
call ladies.

SLY:
Madam w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ife, they say that I have dream'd
And slept above [SEQ_SPLITTER]some fifteen year or more.

Page:
Ay, and the time[SEQ_SPLITTER] seems thirty unto me,
Being all this time abandon[SEQ_SPLITTER]'d from your bed.

SLY:
'Tis much. Servants, leave[SEQ_SPLITTER] me and her alone.
Madam, undress you and come now[SEQ_SPLITTER] to bed.

Page:
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat [SEQ_SPLITTER]of you
To pardon me yet for a night or two,
Or, if[SEQ_SPLITTER] not so, until the sun be set:
For your physicians[SEQ_SPLITTER] have expressly charged,
In peril to incur your fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rmer malady,
That I should yet absent me from your[SEQ_SPLITTER] bed:
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.

SL[SEQ_SPLITTER]Y:
Ay, it stands so that I may hardly
tarry so lon[SEQ_SPLITTER]g. But I would be loath to fall into
my dreams aga[SEQ_SPLITTER]in: I will therefore tarry in
despite of the flesh[SEQ_SPLITTER] and the blood.

Messenger:
Your honour's players,[SEQ_SPLITTER] heating your amendment,
Are come to play a pleasa[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt comedy;
For so your doctors hold it very meet,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
Therefore [SEQ_SPLITTER]they thought it good you hear a play
And frame you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r mind to mirth and merriment,
Which bars a thousa[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd harms and lengthens life.

SLY:
Marry, I will, [SEQ_SPLITTER]let them play it. Is not a
comondy a Christmas gam[SEQ_SPLITTER]bold or a tumbling-trick?

Page:
No, my good lord;[SEQ_SPLITTER] it is more pleasing stuff.

SLY:
What, household [SEQ_SPLITTER]stuff?

Page:
It is a kind of history.

SLY:
Well,[SEQ_SPLITTER] well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side
and [SEQ_SPLITTER]let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.

LU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CENTIO:
Tranio, since for the great desire I had
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
I am arrived fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great [SEQ_SPLITTER]Italy;
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
[SEQ_SPLITTER]With his good will and thy good company,
My trusty[SEQ_SPLITTER] servant, well approved in all,
Here let us breath[SEQ_SPLITTER]e and haply institute
A course of learning and ing[SEQ_SPLITTER]enious studies.
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
G[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave me my being and my father first,
A merchant of[SEQ_SPLITTER] great traffic through the world,
Vincetino come o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f Bentivolii.
Vincetino's son brought up in Floren[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
And th[SEQ_SPLITTER]erefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
Virtue and [SEQ_SPLITTER]that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f happiness
By virtue specially to be achieved.
Te[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
And am to Pad[SEQ_SPLITTER]ua come, as he that leaves
A shallow plash to plun[SEQ_SPLITTER]ge him in the deep
And with satiety seeks to quenc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h his thirst.

TRANIO:
Mi perdonato, gentle master[SEQ_SPLITTER] mine,
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad that[SEQ_SPLITTER] you thus continue your resolve
To suck the sweets[SEQ_SPLITTER] of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we [SEQ_SPLITTER]do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline,
L[SEQ_SPLITTER]et's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so dev[SEQ_SPLITTER]ote to Aristotle's cheques
As Ovid be an outcast q[SEQ_SPLITTER]uite abjured:
Balk logic with acquaintance that yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u have
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Music and poesy use to quicken you;
The mathematic[SEQ_SPLITTER]s and the metaphysics,
Fall to them as you find yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur stomach serves you;
No profit grows where is no[SEQ_SPLITTER] pleasure ta'en:
In brief, sir, study what you mos[SEQ_SPLITTER]t affect.

LUCENTIO:
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost[SEQ_SPLITTER] thou advise.
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore[SEQ_SPLITTER],
We could at once put us in readiness,
And take a[SEQ_SPLITTER] lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in [SEQ_SPLITTER]Padua shall beget.
But stay a while: what company [SEQ_SPLITTER]is this?

TRANIO:
Master, some show to welcome us [SEQ_SPLITTER]to town.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen, importune me no far[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther,
For how I firmly am resolved you know;
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]is, not bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have [SEQ_SPLITTER]a husband for the elder:
If either of you both lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]e Katharina,
Because I know you well and love you [SEQ_SPLITTER]well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pl[SEQ_SPLITTER]easure.

GREMIO:

KATHARINA:
I pray you, sir, is i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t your will
To make a stale of me amongst these ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]tes?

HORTENSIO:
Mates, maid! how mean you that? n[SEQ_SPLITTER]o mates for you,
Unless you were of gentler, milde[SEQ_SPLITTER]r mould.

KATHARINA:
I'faith, sir, you shall never[SEQ_SPLITTER] need to fear:
I wis it is not half way to her hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt;
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And p[SEQ_SPLITTER]aint your face and use you like a fool.

HORTENSIA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!

GRE[SEQ_SPLITTER]MIO:
And me too, good Lord!

TRANIO:
Hush, master![SEQ_SPLITTER] here's some good pastime toward:
That wench is st[SEQ_SPLITTER]ark mad or wonderful froward.

LUCENTIO:
But in th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e other's silence do I see
Maid's mild behavior an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d sobriety.
Peace, Tranio!

TRANIO:
Well said, mas[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter; mum! and gaze your fill.

BAPTISTA:
Gentlemen[SEQ_SPLITTER], that I may soon make good
What I have said, Bian[SEQ_SPLITTER]ca, get you in:
And let it not displease thee, goo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d Bianca,
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]girl.

KATHARINA:
A pretty peat! it is best
Put fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nger in the eye, an she knew why.

BIANCA:
Sister,[SEQ_SPLITTER] content you in my discontent.
Sir, to your pleasu[SEQ_SPLITTER]re humbly I subscribe:
My books and instruments sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all be my company,
On them to took and practise by[SEQ_SPLITTER] myself.

LUCENTIO:
Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear[SEQ_SPLITTER] Minerva speak.

HORTENSIO:
Signior Baptista, will[SEQ_SPLITTER] you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our good will [SEQ_SPLITTER]effects
Bianca's grief.

GREMIO:
Why will you mew [SEQ_SPLITTER]her up,
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And make her bear the penance of her tongue?

BAPT[SEQ_SPLITTER]ISTA:
Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:
Go in,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Bianca:
And for I know she taketh most delight
In[SEQ_SPLITTER] music, instruments and poetry,
Schoolmasters will[SEQ_SPLITTER] I keep within my house,
Fit to instruct her youth[SEQ_SPLITTER]. If you, Hortensio,
Or Signior Gremio, you, know [SEQ_SPLITTER]any such,
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] will be very kind, and liberal
To mine own childr[SEQ_SPLITTER]en in good bringing up:
And so farewell. Katharina[SEQ_SPLITTER], you may stay;
For I have more to commune with Bi[SEQ_SPLITTER]anca.

KATHARINA:
Why, and I trust I may go too, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay I not? What,
shall I be appointed hours; as tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ugh, belike, I
knew not what to take and what to l[SEQ_SPLITTER]eave, ha?

GREMIO:
You may go to the devil's dam: [SEQ_SPLITTER]your gifts are so
good, here's none will hold you.[SEQ_SPLITTER] Their love is not
so great, Hortensio, but we may[SEQ_SPLITTER] blow our nails
together, and fast it fairly out: [SEQ_SPLITTER]our cakes dough on
both sides. Farewell: yet for t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he love I bear my
sweet Bianca, if I can by any me[SEQ_SPLITTER]ans light on a fit
man to teach her that wherein s[SEQ_SPLITTER]he delights, I will
wish him to her father.

HORTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NSIO:
So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pra[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never broo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ked
parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us b[SEQ_SPLITTER]oth,
that we may yet again have access to our fair[SEQ_SPLITTER]
mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to[SEQ_SPLITTER]
labour and effect one thing specially.

GREMIO:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat's that, I pray?

HORTENSIO:
Marry, sir, to get[SEQ_SPLITTER] a husband for her sister.

GREMIO:
A husband! a d[SEQ_SPLITTER]evil.

HORTENSIO:
I say, a husband.

GREMIO:
I say[SEQ_SPLITTER], a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though
her fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther be very rich, any man is so very a fool
to be[SEQ_SPLITTER] married to hell?

HORTENSIO:
Tush, Gremio, though[SEQ_SPLITTER] it pass your patience and mine
to endure her loud[SEQ_SPLITTER] alarums, why, man, there be good
fellows in the w[SEQ_SPLITTER]orld, an a man could light on them,
would take her[SEQ_SPLITTER] with all faults, and money enough.

GREMIO:
I can[SEQ_SPLITTER]not tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is condition, to be whipped at the high cross
ever[SEQ_SPLITTER]y morning.

HORTENSIO:
Faith, as you say, there's [SEQ_SPLITTER]small choice in rotten
apples. But come; since thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s bar in law makes us
friends, it shall be so far [SEQ_SPLITTER]forth friendly
maintained all by helping Baptista'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s eldest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest[SEQ_SPLITTER] free for a husband,
and then have to't a fresh. S[SEQ_SPLITTER]weet Bianca! Happy man
be his dole! He that runs f[SEQ_SPLITTER]astest gets the ring.
How say you, Signior Gremio?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

GREMIO:
I am agreed; and would I had given him t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he best
horse in Padua to begin his wooing that wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]uld
thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and ri[SEQ_SPLITTER]d the
house of her! Come on.

TRANIO:
I pray, sir,[SEQ_SPLITTER] tell me, is it possible
That love should of a sud[SEQ_SPLITTER]den take such hold?

LUCENTIO:
O Tranio, till I fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]und it to be true,
I never thought it possible or [SEQ_SPLITTER]likely;
But see, while idly I stood looking on,
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]found the effect of love in idleness:
And now in p[SEQ_SPLITTER]lainness do confess to thee,
That art to me as sec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ret and as dear
As Anna to the queen of Carthage w[SEQ_SPLITTER]as,
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
If I[SEQ_SPLITTER] achieve not this young modest girl.
Counsel me, T[SEQ_SPLITTER]ranio, for I know thou canst;
Assist me, Tranio, f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or I know thou wilt.

TRANIO:
Master, it is no tim[SEQ_SPLITTER]e to chide you now;
Affection is not rated from th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e heart:
If love have touch'd you, nought remains [SEQ_SPLITTER]but so,
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'

LUC[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENTIO:
Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]TRANIO:
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.

LU[SEQ_SPLITTER]CENTIO:
O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
Suc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h as the daughter of Agenor had,
That made great J[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove to humble him to her hand.
When with his knees[SEQ_SPLITTER] he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

TRANIO:
Saw you no [SEQ_SPLITTER]more? mark'd you not how her sister
Began to scold[SEQ_SPLITTER] and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might [SEQ_SPLITTER]hardly endure the din?

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, I saw he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r coral lips to move
And with her breath she did p[SEQ_SPLITTER]erfume the air:
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in [SEQ_SPLITTER]her.

TRANIO:
Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him fro[SEQ_SPLITTER]m his trance.
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the [SEQ_SPLITTER]maid,
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus [SEQ_SPLITTER]it stands:
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrew[SEQ_SPLITTER]d
That till the father rid his hands of her,
Maste[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, your love must live a maid at home;
And therefo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re has he closely mew'd her up,
Because she will n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot be annoy'd with suitors.

LUCENTIO:
Ah, Tranio,[SEQ_SPLITTER] what a cruel father's he!
But art thou not advise[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, he took some care
To get her cunning schoolmast[SEQ_SPLITTER]ers to instruct her?

TRANIO:
Ay, marry, am I, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER]; and now 'tis plotted.

LUCENTIO:
I have it, Tran[SEQ_SPLITTER]io.

TRANIO:
Master, for my hand,
Both our inventi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ons meet and jump in one.

LUCENTIO:
Tell me thine[SEQ_SPLITTER] first.

TRANIO:
You will be schoolmaster
And unde[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtake the teaching of the maid:
That's your device[SEQ_SPLITTER].

LUCENTIO:
It is: may it be done?

TRANIO:
Not p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ossible; for who shall bear your part,
And be in P[SEQ_SPLITTER]adua here Vincentio's son,
Keep house and ply his [SEQ_SPLITTER]book, welcome his friends,
Visit his countrymen an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d banquet them?

LUCENTIO:
Basta; content thee, fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any[SEQ_SPLITTER] house,
Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
[SEQ_SPLITTER]For man or master; then it follows thus;
Thou shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]t be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Keep house and p[SEQ_SPLITTER]ort and servants as I should:
I will some other be[SEQ_SPLITTER], some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man [SEQ_SPLITTER]of Pisa.
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at [SEQ_SPLITTER]once
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
But I will[SEQ_SPLITTER] charm him first to keep his tongue.

TRANIO:
So h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ad you need.
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure [SEQ_SPLITTER]is,
And I am tied to be obedient;
For so your fath[SEQ_SPLITTER]er charged me at our parting,
'Be serviceable to m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y son,' quoth he,
Although I think 'twas in anothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r sense;
I am content to be Lucentio,
Because so w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell I love Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, be so, bec[SEQ_SPLITTER]ause Lucentio loves:
And let me be a slave, to ach[SEQ_SPLITTER]ieve that maid
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my[SEQ_SPLITTER] wounded eye.
Here comes the rogue.
Sirrah, where [SEQ_SPLITTER]have you been?

BIONDELLO:
Where have I been! Nay,[SEQ_SPLITTER] how now! where are you?
Master, has my fellow Tra[SEQ_SPLITTER]nio stolen your clothes? Or
you stolen his? or bot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h? pray, what's the news?

LUCENTIO:
Sirrah, come [SEQ_SPLITTER]hither: 'tis no time to jest,
And therefore frame [SEQ_SPLITTER]your manners to the time.
Your fellow Tranio here,[SEQ_SPLITTER] to save my life,
Puts my apparel and my countenan[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce on,
And I for my escape have put on his;
For in[SEQ_SPLITTER] a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man and [SEQ_SPLITTER]fear I was descried:
Wait you on him, I charge you[SEQ_SPLITTER], as becomes,
While I make way from hence to save [SEQ_SPLITTER]my life:
You understand me?

BIONDELLO:
I, sir! ne[SEQ_SPLITTER]'er a whit.

LUCENTIO:
And not a jot of Tranio in [SEQ_SPLITTER]your mouth:
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.

BION[SEQ_SPLITTER]DELLO:
The better for him: would I were so too!

T[SEQ_SPLITTER]RANIO:
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh after,
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youn[SEQ_SPLITTER]gest daughter.
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our master's, I advise
You use your manners discre[SEQ_SPLITTER]etly in all kind of companies:
When I am alone, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, then I am Tranio;
But in all places else your m[SEQ_SPLITTER]aster Lucentio.

LUCENTIO:
Tranio, let's go: one t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hing more rests, that
thyself execute, to make one[SEQ_SPLITTER] among these wooers: if
thou ask me why, sufficeth[SEQ_SPLITTER], my reasons are both good
and weighty.

First Ser[SEQ_SPLITTER]vant:
My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
SLY:
Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, sur[SEQ_SPLITTER]ely:
comes there any more of it?

Page:
My lord, '[SEQ_SPLITTER]tis but begun.

SLY:
'Tis a very excellent piece o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f work, madam lady:
would 'twere done!

PETRUCHIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Verona, for a while I take my leave,
To see my fr[SEQ_SPLITTER]iends in Padua, but of all
My best beloved and app[SEQ_SPLITTER]roved friend,
Hortensio; and I trow this is his ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]use.
Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.

GRUMIO:
K[SEQ_SPLITTER]nock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ebused your worship?

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, k[SEQ_SPLITTER]nock me here soundly.

GRUMIO:
Knock you here, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER]! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
I should knock yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u here, sir?

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I say, knock me [SEQ_SPLITTER]at this gate
And rap me well, or I'll knock your k[SEQ_SPLITTER]nave's pate.

GRUMIO:
My master is grown quarrelso[SEQ_SPLITTER]me. I should knock
you first,
And then I know afte[SEQ_SPLITTER]r who comes by the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
Will it not [SEQ_SPLITTER]be?
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring [SEQ_SPLITTER]it;
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

GR[SEQ_SPLITTER]UMIO:
Help, masters, help! my master is mad.

PETR[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCHIO:
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
HORTENSIO:
How now! what's the matter? My old fri[SEQ_SPLITTER]end Grumio!
and my good friend Petruchio! How do y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome you to part the fray?
'Con tutto il cuore, ben[SEQ_SPLITTER] trovato,' may I say.

HORTENSIO:
'Alla nostra cas[SEQ_SPLITTER]a ben venuto, molto honorato signor
mio Petruchio.[SEQ_SPLITTER]' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
this quarre[SEQ_SPLITTER]l.

GRUMIO:
Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leg[SEQ_SPLITTER]es in Latin.
if this be not a lawful case for me t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o leave his
service, look you, sir, he bid me knoc[SEQ_SPLITTER]k him and rap
him soundly, sir: well, was it fit f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or a servant to
use his master so, being perhaps, [SEQ_SPLITTER]for aught I see,
two and thirty, a pip out? Whom w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould to God I had
well knock'd at first, Then had [SEQ_SPLITTER]not Grumio come by the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
A sensel[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess villain! Good Hortensio,
I bade the rascal kno[SEQ_SPLITTER]ck upon your gate
And could not get him for my hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt to do it.

GRUMIO:
Knock at the gate! O heavens[SEQ_SPLITTER]! Spake you not these
words plain, 'Sirrah, knock [SEQ_SPLITTER]me here, rap me here,
knock me well, and knock me [SEQ_SPLITTER]soundly'? And come you
now with, 'knocking at the [SEQ_SPLITTER]gate'?

PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] advise you.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, patience; I am[SEQ_SPLITTER] Grumio's pledge:
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twix[SEQ_SPLITTER]t him and you,
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant serv[SEQ_SPLITTER]ant Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ppy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
PETRUCHIO:
Such wind as scatters young men throug[SEQ_SPLITTER]h the world,
To seek their fortunes farther than a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t home
Where small experience grows. But in a few,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Antoni[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, my father, is deceased;
And I have thrust mysel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f into this maze,
Haply to wive and thrive as best[SEQ_SPLITTER] I may:
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at hom[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
And so am come abroad to see the world.

HORTEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]SIO:
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
And yet[SEQ_SPLITTER] I'll promise thee she shall be rich
And very rich[SEQ_SPLITTER]: but thou'rt too much my friend,
And I'll not wis[SEQ_SPLITTER]h thee to her.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, 'twi[SEQ_SPLITTER]xt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and there[SEQ_SPLITTER]fore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s wife,
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
B[SEQ_SPLITTER]e she as foul as was Florentius' love,
As old as S[SEQ_SPLITTER]ibyl and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates' Xanthipp[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, or a worse,
She moves me not, or not removes, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]t least,
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough[SEQ_SPLITTER]
As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
I come to wive[SEQ_SPLITTER] it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily[SEQ_SPLITTER] in Padua.

GRUMIO:
Nay, look you, sir, he tells y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou flatly what his
mind is: Why give him gold enou[SEQ_SPLITTER]gh and marry him to
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or [SEQ_SPLITTER]an old trot with ne'er
a tooth in her head, though[SEQ_SPLITTER] she have as many diseases
as two and fifty horses[SEQ_SPLITTER]: why, nothing comes amiss,
so money comes withal.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus [SEQ_SPLITTER]far in,
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
With wealth e[SEQ_SPLITTER]nough and young and beauteous,
Brought up as best [SEQ_SPLITTER]becomes a gentlewoman:
Her only fault, and that is[SEQ_SPLITTER] faults enough,
Is that she is intolerable curst
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
That,[SEQ_SPLITTER] were my state far worser than it is,
I would not [SEQ_SPLITTER]wed her for a mine of gold.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio,[SEQ_SPLITTER] peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
Tell me he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r father's name and 'tis enough;
For I will board [SEQ_SPLITTER]her, though she chide as loud
As thunder when the [SEQ_SPLITTER]clouds in autumn crack.

HORTENSIO:
Her father is [SEQ_SPLITTER]Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous gentlema[SEQ_SPLITTER]n:
Her name is Katharina Minola,
Renown'd in Padua[SEQ_SPLITTER] for her scolding tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
I know her f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather, though I know not her;
And he knew my decea[SEQ_SPLITTER]sed father well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till[SEQ_SPLITTER] I see her;
And therefore let me be thus bold with[SEQ_SPLITTER] you
To give you over at this first encounter,
Unl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess you will accompany me thither.

GRUMIO:
I pray[SEQ_SPLITTER] you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
O' m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
would[SEQ_SPLITTER] think scolding would do little good upon him:
she[SEQ_SPLITTER] may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
[SEQ_SPLITTER]stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
[SEQ_SPLITTER]her face and so disfigure her with it that she
sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
You[SEQ_SPLITTER] know him not, sir.

HORTENSIO:
Tarry, Petruchio, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I must go with thee,
For in Baptista's keep my tre[SEQ_SPLITTER]asure is:
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
Hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
And her wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hholds from me and other more,
Suitors to her and [SEQ_SPLITTER]rivals in my love,
Supposing it a thing impossible[SEQ_SPLITTER],
For those defects I have before rehearsed,
That [SEQ_SPLITTER]ever Katharina will be woo'd;
Therefore this order[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath Baptista ta'en,
That none shall have access [SEQ_SPLITTER]unto Bianca
Till Katharina the curst have got a hu[SEQ_SPLITTER]sband.

GRUMIO:
Katharina the curst!
A title for a[SEQ_SPLITTER] maid of all titles the worst.

HORTENSIO:
Now sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll my friend Petruchio do me grace,
And offer me d[SEQ_SPLITTER]isguised in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoo[SEQ_SPLITTER]lmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at so I may, by this device, at least
Have leave a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd leisure to make love to her
And unsuspected cou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt her by herself.

GRUMIO:
Here's no knavery! See[SEQ_SPLITTER], to beguile the old folks,
how the young folks la[SEQ_SPLITTER]y their heads together!
Master, master, look about[SEQ_SPLITTER] you: who goes there, ha?

HORTENSIO:
Peace, Grumi[SEQ_SPLITTER]o! it is the rival of my love.
Petruchio, stand by[SEQ_SPLITTER] a while.

GRUMIO:
A proper stripling and an amoro[SEQ_SPLITTER]us!

GREMIO:
O, very well; I have perused the note[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
All books of love, see that at any hand;
And see [SEQ_SPLITTER]you read no other lectures to her:
You understand [SEQ_SPLITTER]me: over and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And let me have them very well perfumed
For she i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. [SEQ_SPLITTER]What will you read to her?

LUCENTIO:
Whate'er I r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ead to her, I'll plead for you
As for my patron, s[SEQ_SPLITTER]tand you so assured,
As firmly as yourself were st[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill in place:
Yea, and perhaps with more successfu[SEQ_SPLITTER]l words
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
GREMIO:
O this learning, what a thing it is!

GRU[SEQ_SPLITTER]MIO:
O this woodcock, what an ass it is!

PETRUCHI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
Peace, sirrah!

HORTENSIO:
Grumio, mum! God sav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e you, Signior Gremio.

GREMIO:
And you are well m[SEQ_SPLITTER]et, Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going[SEQ_SPLITTER]? To Baptista Minola.
I promised to inquire carefu[SEQ_SPLITTER]lly
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young [SEQ_SPLITTER]man, for learning and behavior
Fit for her turn, w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell read in poetry
And other books, good ones, I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]arrant ye.

HORTENSIO:
'Tis well; and I have met a[SEQ_SPLITTER] gentleman
Hath promised me to help me to another,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
So shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca, so b[SEQ_SPLITTER]eloved of me.

GREMIO:
Beloved of me; and that my [SEQ_SPLITTER]deeds shall prove.

GRUMIO:
And that his bags shal[SEQ_SPLITTER]l prove.

HORTENSIO:
Gremio, 'tis now no time to v[SEQ_SPLITTER]ent our love:
Listen to me, and if you speak me fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ir,
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either[SEQ_SPLITTER].
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
Upon a[SEQ_SPLITTER]greement from us to his liking,
Will undertake to [SEQ_SPLITTER]woo curst Katharina,
Yea, and to marry her, if her[SEQ_SPLITTER] dowry please.

GREMIO:
So said, so done, is well.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

PET[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUCHIO:
I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]f that be all, masters, I hear no harm.

GREMIO:
N[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?

PETRUCH[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
My father d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ead, my fortune lives for me;
And I do hope good d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ays and long to see.

GREMIO:
O sir, such a life, [SEQ_SPLITTER]with such a wife, were strange!
But if you have a [SEQ_SPLITTER]stomach, to't i' God's name:
You shall have me ass[SEQ_SPLITTER]isting you in all.
But will you woo this wild-cat?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PETRUCHIO:
Will I live?

GRUMIO:
Will he woo her[SEQ_SPLITTER]? ay, or I'll hang her.

PETRUCHIO:
Why came I hit[SEQ_SPLITTER]her but to that intent?
Think you a little din can[SEQ_SPLITTER] daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lion[SEQ_SPLITTER]s roar?
Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nds
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]ven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n a pitched battle heard
Loud 'larums, neighing st[SEQ_SPLITTER]eeds, and trumpets' clang?
And do you tell me of a[SEQ_SPLITTER] woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a bl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.

GRUMIO:
For he f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ears none.

GREMIO:
Hortensio, hark:
This gentlema[SEQ_SPLITTER]n is happily arrived,
My mind presumes, for his ow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n good and ours.

HORTENSIO:
I promised we would b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e contributors
And bear his charging of wooing, wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]atsoe'er.

GREMIO:
And so we will, provided that h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e win her.

GRUMIO:
I would I were as sure of a go[SEQ_SPLITTER]od dinner.

TRANIO:
Gentlemen, God save you. If I [SEQ_SPLITTER]may be bold,
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the [SEQ_SPLITTER]readiest way
To the house of Signior Baptista Mino[SEQ_SPLITTER]la?

BIONDELLO:
He that has the two fair daughters[SEQ_SPLITTER]: is't he you mean?

TRANIO:
Even he, Biondello.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]GREMIO:
Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--

TRAN[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do[SEQ_SPLITTER]?

PETRUCHIO:
Not her that chides, sir, at any han[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, I pray.

TRANIO:
I love no chiders, sir. Bionde[SEQ_SPLITTER]llo, let's away.

LUCENTIO:
Well begun, Tranio.

H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ORTENSIO:
Sir, a word ere you go;
Are you a suitor[SEQ_SPLITTER] to the maid you talk of, yea or no?

TRANIO:
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]if I be, sir, is it any offence?

GREMIO:
No; if w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ithout more words you will get you hence.

TRANIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
For[SEQ_SPLITTER] me as for you?

GREMIO:
But so is not she.

TRANI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
For what reason, I beseech you?

GREMIO:
For th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is reason, if you'll know,
That she's the choice l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove of Signior Gremio.

HORTENSIO:
That she's the [SEQ_SPLITTER]chosen of Signior Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Softly, my m[SEQ_SPLITTER]asters! if you be gentlemen,
Do me this right; hea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
To whom my father is not all unknown;
And were hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s daughter fairer than she is,
She may more suitor[SEQ_SPLITTER]s have and me for one.
Fair Leda's daughter had a [SEQ_SPLITTER]thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Bianc[SEQ_SPLITTER]a have:
And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

GREMIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.

LUCE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NTIO:
Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, to what end are all thes[SEQ_SPLITTER]e words?

HORTENSIO:
Sir, let me be so bold as ask[SEQ_SPLITTER] you,
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?

T[SEQ_SPLITTER]RANIO:
No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the ot[SEQ_SPLITTER]her for beauteous modesty.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, sir, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he first's for me; let her go by.

GREMIO:
Yea, le[SEQ_SPLITTER]ave that labour to great Hercules;
And let it be m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore than Alcides' twelve.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, underst[SEQ_SPLITTER]and you this of me in sooth:
The youngest daughter[SEQ_SPLITTER] whom you hearken for
Her father keeps from all ac[SEQ_SPLITTER]cess of suitors,
And will not promise her to any m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an
Until the elder sister first be wed:
The younge[SEQ_SPLITTER]r then is free and not before.

TRANIO:
If it be s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, sir, that you are the man
Must stead us all and[SEQ_SPLITTER] me amongst the rest,
And if you break the ice and[SEQ_SPLITTER] do this feat,
Achieve the elder, set the younger [SEQ_SPLITTER]free
For our access, whose hap shall be to have he[SEQ_SPLITTER]r
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

HORTENS[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
An[SEQ_SPLITTER]d since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s we do, gratify this gentleman,
To whom we all re[SEQ_SPLITTER]st generally beholding.

TRANIO:
Sir, I shall not [SEQ_SPLITTER]be slack: in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ess' health,
And do as adversaries do in law,
Stri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

GRUMIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.

HOR[SEQ_SPLITTER]TENSIO:
The motion's good indeed and be it so,
Pet[SEQ_SPLITTER]ruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.

BIANCA:
Good [SEQ_SPLITTER]sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make [SEQ_SPLITTER]a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain: but [SEQ_SPLITTER]for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I'll pull [SEQ_SPLITTER]them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my pettic[SEQ_SPLITTER]oat;
Or what you will command me will I do,
So wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l I know my duty to my elders.

KATHARINA:
Of all [SEQ_SPLITTER]thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
Whom thou lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]vest best: see thou dissemble not.

BIANCA:
Believ[SEQ_SPLITTER]e me, sister, of all the men alive
I never yet beh[SEQ_SPLITTER]eld that special face
Which I could fancy more tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n any other.

KATHARINA:
Minion, thou liest. Is't [SEQ_SPLITTER]not Hortensio?

BIANCA:
If you affect him, sister,[SEQ_SPLITTER] here I swear
I'll plead for you myself, but you s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hall have
him.

KATHARINA:
O then, belike, you fan[SEQ_SPLITTER]cy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep you f[SEQ_SPLITTER]air.

BIANCA:
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay[SEQ_SPLITTER] then you jest, and now I well perceive
You have b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ut jested with me all this while:
I prithee, siste[SEQ_SPLITTER]r Kate, untie my hands.

KATHARINA:
If that be jes[SEQ_SPLITTER]t, then all the rest was so.

BAPTISTA:
Why, how n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow, dame! whence grows this insolence?
Bianca, sta[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
Go ply thy needle;[SEQ_SPLITTER] meddle not with her.
For shame, thou helding of a[SEQ_SPLITTER] devilish spirit,
Why dost thou wrong her that did[SEQ_SPLITTER] ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a [SEQ_SPLITTER]bitter word?

KATHARINA:
Her silence flouts me, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d I'll be revenged.

BAPTISTA:
What, in my sight? [SEQ_SPLITTER]Bianca, get thee in.

KATHARINA:
What, will you no[SEQ_SPLITTER]t suffer me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, [SEQ_SPLITTER]she must have a husband;
I must dance bare-foot on[SEQ_SPLITTER] her wedding day
And for your love to her lead ape[SEQ_SPLITTER]s in hell.
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Till I can find occasion of revenge.

BAPTISTA:
Wa[SEQ_SPLITTER]s ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
But who comes [SEQ_SPLITTER]here ?

GREMIO:
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]BAPTISTA:
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
God save [SEQ_SPLITTER]you, gentlemen!

PETRUCHIO:
And you, good sir! Pra[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, have you not a daughter
Call'd Katharina, fair [SEQ_SPLITTER]and virtuous?

BAPTISTA:
I have a daughter, sir, c[SEQ_SPLITTER]alled Katharina.

GREMIO:
You are too blunt: go to[SEQ_SPLITTER] it orderly.

PETRUCHIO:
You wrong me, Signior Gre[SEQ_SPLITTER]mio: give me leave.
I am a gentleman of Verona, si[SEQ_SPLITTER]r,
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Her af[SEQ_SPLITTER]fability and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous qualiti[SEQ_SPLITTER]es and mild behavior,
Am bold to show myself a for[SEQ_SPLITTER]ward guest
Within your house, to make mine eye the[SEQ_SPLITTER] witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
I do pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]esent you with a man of mine,
Cunning in music and[SEQ_SPLITTER] the mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those s[SEQ_SPLITTER]ciences,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
Accep[SEQ_SPLITTER]t of him, or else you do me wrong:
His name is Lic[SEQ_SPLITTER]io, born in Mantua.

BAPTISTA:
You're welcome, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER]; and he, for your good sake.
But for my daughter [SEQ_SPLITTER]Katharina, this I know,
She is not for your turn, [SEQ_SPLITTER]the more my grief.

PETRUCHIO:
I see you do not me[SEQ_SPLITTER]an to part with her,
Or else you like not of my co[SEQ_SPLITTER]mpany.

BAPTISTA:
Mistake me not; I speak but as I[SEQ_SPLITTER] find.
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ame?

PETRUCHIO:
Petruchio is my name; Antonio's s[SEQ_SPLITTER]on,
A man well known throughout all Italy.

BAPTIS[SEQ_SPLITTER]TA:
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

GREMIO:
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Let[SEQ_SPLITTER] us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
Baccare[SEQ_SPLITTER]! you are marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO:
O, pardo[SEQ_SPLITTER]n me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.

GREM[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I [SEQ_SPLITTER]am
sure of it. To express the like kindness, mysel[SEQ_SPLITTER]f,
that have been more kindly beholding to you tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n
any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning
i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
[SEQ_SPLITTER]in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray[SEQ_SPLITTER],
accept his service.

BAPTISTA:
A thousand thanks[SEQ_SPLITTER], Signior Gremio.
Welcome, good Cambio.
But, gentl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
may I be[SEQ_SPLITTER] so bold to know the cause of your coming?

TRANIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
That, [SEQ_SPLITTER]being a stranger in this city here,
Do make myself[SEQ_SPLITTER] a suitor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and [SEQ_SPLITTER]virtuous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This liber[SEQ_SPLITTER]ty is all that I request,
That, upon knowledge of [SEQ_SPLITTER]my parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest [SEQ_SPLITTER]that woo
And free access and favour as the rest:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, toward the education of your daughters,
I here[SEQ_SPLITTER] bestow a simple instrument,
And this small packet[SEQ_SPLITTER] of Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, the[SEQ_SPLITTER]n their worth is great.

BAPTISTA:
Lucentio is you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r name; of whence, I pray?

TRANIO:
Of Pisa, sir; [SEQ_SPLITTER]son to Vincentio.

BAPTISTA:
A mighty man of Pisa;[SEQ_SPLITTER] by report
I know him well: you are very welcome, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hin!
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
To my daughters;[SEQ_SPLITTER] and tell them both,
These are their tutors: bid t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hem use them well.
We will go walk a little in the[SEQ_SPLITTER] orchard,
And then to dinner. You are passing welc[SEQ_SPLITTER]ome,
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ETRUCHIO:
Signior Baptista, my business asketh has[SEQ_SPLITTER]te,
And every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y father well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to [SEQ_SPLITTER]all his lands and goods,
Which I have better'd rat[SEQ_SPLITTER]her than decreased:
Then tell me, if I get your da[SEQ_SPLITTER]ughter's love,
What dowry shall I have with her to[SEQ_SPLITTER] wife?

BAPTISTA:
After my death the one half of m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y lands,
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PETRUCHIO:
And, for that dowry, I'll assure her [SEQ_SPLITTER]of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In al[SEQ_SPLITTER]l my lands and leases whatsoever:
Let specialties [SEQ_SPLITTER]be therefore drawn between us,
That covenants may [SEQ_SPLITTER]be kept on either hand.

BAPTISTA:
Ay, when the sp[SEQ_SPLITTER]ecial thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, that is no[SEQ_SPLITTER]thing: for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptory [SEQ_SPLITTER]as she proud-minded;
And where two raging fires me[SEQ_SPLITTER]et together
They do consume the thing that feeds t[SEQ_SPLITTER]heir fury:
Though little fire grows great with lit[SEQ_SPLITTER]tle wind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and[SEQ_SPLITTER] all:
So I to her and so she yields to me;
For I a[SEQ_SPLITTER]m rough and woo not like a babe.

BAPTISTA:
Well m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
But be thou[SEQ_SPLITTER] arm'd for some unhappy words.

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, to [SEQ_SPLITTER]the proof; as mountains are for winds,
That shake [SEQ_SPLITTER]not, though they blow perpetually.

BAPTISTA:
How [SEQ_SPLITTER]now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?

HORTE[SEQ_SPLITTER]NSIO:
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

BA[SEQ_SPLITTER]PTISTA:
What, will my daughter prove a good musici[SEQ_SPLITTER]an?

HORTENSIO:
I think she'll sooner prove a sold[SEQ_SPLITTER]ier
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.

BAPT[SEQ_SPLITTER]ISTA:
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lu[SEQ_SPLITTER]te?

HORTENSIO:
Why, no; for she hath broke the lu[SEQ_SPLITTER]te to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets[SEQ_SPLITTER],
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
When,[SEQ_SPLITTER] with a most impatient devilish spirit,
'Frets, ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
with them:'
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd, with that word, she struck me on the head,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] through the instrument my pate made way;
And ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I stood amazed for a while,
As on a pillory, loo[SEQ_SPLITTER]king through the lute;
While she did call me rasca[SEQ_SPLITTER]l fiddler
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vil[SEQ_SPLITTER]e terms,
As had she studied to misuse me so.

PETR[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCHIO:
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
I l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ove her ten times more than e'er I did:
O, how I l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ong to have some chat with her!

BAPTISTA:
Well, g[SEQ_SPLITTER]o with me and be not so discomfited:
Proceed in pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]actise with my younger daughter;
She's apt to lear[SEQ_SPLITTER]n and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, [SEQ_SPLITTER]will you go with us,
Or shall I send my daughter K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate to you?

PETRUCHIO:
I pray you do.
I will atte[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd her here,
And woo her with some spirit when she[SEQ_SPLITTER] comes.
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her [SEQ_SPLITTER]plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Say t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
As morn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing roses newly wash'd with dew:
Say she be mute a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd will not speak a word;
Then I'll commend her vo[SEQ_SPLITTER]lubility,
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
As t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hough she bid me stay by her a week:
If she deny t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o wed, I'll crave the day
When I shall ask the ban[SEQ_SPLITTER]ns and when be married.
But here she comes; and no[SEQ_SPLITTER]w, Petruchio, speak.
Good morrow, Kate; for that's[SEQ_SPLITTER] your name, I hear.

KATHARINA:
Well have you hear[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, but something hard of hearing:
They call me Kat[SEQ_SPLITTER]harina that do talk of me.

PETRUCHIO:
You lie, in[SEQ_SPLITTER] faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate and sometimes Kate the curst;
But Kate, the pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ettiest Kate in Christendom
Kate of Kate Hall, my [SEQ_SPLITTER]super-dainty Kate,
For dainties are all Kates, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my cons[SEQ_SPLITTER]olation;
Hearing thy mildness praised in every tow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]et not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am mov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed to woo thee for my wife.

KATHARINA:
Moved! in [SEQ_SPLITTER]good time: let him that moved you hither
Remove yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u hence: I knew you at the first
You were a moveab[SEQ_SPLITTER]le.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, what's a moveable?

KATHARINA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
A join'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast hit it: co[SEQ_SPLITTER]me, sit on me.

KATHARINA:
Asses are made to bear,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and so are you.

PETRUCHIO:
Women are made to bea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, and so are you.

KATHARINA:
No such jade as you[SEQ_SPLITTER], if me you mean.

PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill not burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be but y[SEQ_SPLITTER]oung and light--

KATHARINA:
Too light for such a [SEQ_SPLITTER]swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weig[SEQ_SPLITTER]ht should be.

PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should--buzz![SEQ_SPLITTER]

KATHARINA:
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.

PETR[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCHIO:
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee?

KATHARINA:
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a [SEQ_SPLITTER]buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, you wasp; i' fait[SEQ_SPLITTER]h, you are too angry.

KATHARINA:
If I be waspish,[SEQ_SPLITTER] best beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO:
My remedy is th[SEQ_SPLITTER]en, to pluck it out.

KATHARINA:
Ay, if the fool c[SEQ_SPLITTER]ould find it where it lies,

PETRUCHIO:
Who knows [SEQ_SPLITTER]not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

KATHARINA:
In his tongue.

PETRUCHIO:
Whose tong[SEQ_SPLITTER]ue?

KATHARINA:
Yours, if you talk of tails: and s[SEQ_SPLITTER]o farewell.

PETRUCHIO:
What, with my tongue in yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur tail? nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentle[SEQ_SPLITTER]man.

KATHARINA:
That I'll try.

PETRUCHIO:
I swea[SEQ_SPLITTER]r I'll cuff you, if you strike again.

KATHARINA:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]So may you lose your arms:
If you strike me, you a[SEQ_SPLITTER]re no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no [SEQ_SPLITTER]arms.

PETRUCHIO:
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] books!

KATHARINA:
What is your crest? a coxcomb?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate will be my h[SEQ_SPLITTER]en.

KATHARINA:
No cock of mine; you crow too like[SEQ_SPLITTER] a craven.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, come, Kate, come; you [SEQ_SPLITTER]must not look so sour.

KATHARINA:
It is my fashio[SEQ_SPLITTER]n, when I see a crab.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, here's no c[SEQ_SPLITTER]rab; and therefore look not sour.

KATHARINA:
Ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]e is, there is.

PETRUCHIO:
Then show it me.

KATH[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARINA:
Had I a glass, I would.

PETRUCHIO:
What, y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou mean my face?

KATHARINA:
Well aim'd of such a [SEQ_SPLITTER]young one.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint George, I am [SEQ_SPLITTER]too young for you.

KATHARINA:
Yet you are wither'[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis with cares.

KATHARINA:
I care[SEQ_SPLITTER] not.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u scape not so.

KATHARINA:
I chafe you, if I tarr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y: let me go.

PETRUCHIO:
No, not a whit: I find y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou passing gentle.
'Twas told me you were rough an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d coy and sullen,
And now I find report a very lia[SEQ_SPLITTER]r;
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courte[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time [SEQ_SPLITTER]flowers:
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look[SEQ_SPLITTER] askance,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
But t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
With ge[SEQ_SPLITTER]ntle conference, soft and affable.
Why does the wo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rld report that Kate doth limp?
O slanderous world[SEQ_SPLITTER]! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender[SEQ_SPLITTER] and as brown in hue
As hazel nuts and sweeter tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]n the kernels.
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost [SEQ_SPLITTER]not halt.

KATHARINA:
Go, fool, and whom thou keep[SEQ_SPLITTER]'st command.

PETRUCHIO:
Did ever Dian so become a[SEQ_SPLITTER] grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait[SEQ_SPLITTER]?
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
And then l[SEQ_SPLITTER]et Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA:
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]here did you study all this goodly speech?

PETRUC[SEQ_SPLITTER]HIO:
It is extempore, from my mother-wit.

KATHARI[SEQ_SPLITTER]NA:
A witty mother! witless else her son.

PETRUCH[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
Am I not wise?

KATHARINA:
Yes; keep you warm.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in[SEQ_SPLITTER] thy bed:
And therefore, setting all this chat asi[SEQ_SPLITTER]de,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consente[SEQ_SPLITTER]d
That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate, I am a husband for your turn;
For, by this li[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght, whereby I see thy beauty,
Thy beauty, that do[SEQ_SPLITTER]th make me like thee well,
Thou must be married to[SEQ_SPLITTER] no man but me;
For I am he am born to tame you Ka[SEQ_SPLITTER]te,
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Confo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rmable as other household Kates.
Here comes your f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather: never make denial;
I must and will have Kat[SEQ_SPLITTER]harina to my wife.

BAPTISTA:
Now, Signior Petruch[SEQ_SPLITTER]io, how speed you with my daughter?

PETRUCHIO:
Ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]w but well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible [SEQ_SPLITTER]I should speed amiss.

BAPTISTA:
Why, how now, dau[SEQ_SPLITTER]ghter Katharina! in your dumps?

KATHARINA:
Call y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou me daughter? now, I promise you
You have show'd[SEQ_SPLITTER] a tender fatherly regard,
To wish me wed to one h[SEQ_SPLITTER]alf lunatic;
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack[SEQ_SPLITTER],
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]PETRUCHIO:
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the[SEQ_SPLITTER] world,
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er:
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For she's n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot[SEQ_SPLITTER], but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will[SEQ_SPLITTER] prove a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her[SEQ_SPLITTER] chastity:
And to conclude, we have 'greed so well[SEQ_SPLITTER] together,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ATHARINA:
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]REMIO:
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ang'd first.

TRANIO:
Is this your speeding? nay, [SEQ_SPLITTER]then, good night our part!

PETRUCHIO:
Be patient,[SEQ_SPLITTER] gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
If she and I [SEQ_SPLITTER]be pleased, what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'tw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ixt us twain, being alone,
That she shall still be[SEQ_SPLITTER] curst in company.
I tell you, 'tis incredible to [SEQ_SPLITTER]believe
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate[SEQ_SPLITTER]!
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
She vie[SEQ_SPLITTER]d so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twin[SEQ_SPLITTER]k she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'tis[SEQ_SPLITTER] a world to see,
How tame, when men and women are [SEQ_SPLITTER]alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shre[SEQ_SPLITTER]w.
Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the f[SEQ_SPLITTER]east, father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y Katharina shall be fine.

BAPTISTA:
I know not w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat to say: but give me your hands;
God send you j[SEQ_SPLITTER]oy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.

GREMIO:
Amen, say we[SEQ_SPLITTER]: we will be witnesses.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, and wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]fe, and gentlemen, adieu;
I will to Venice; Sunday[SEQ_SPLITTER] comes apace:
We will have rings and things and fi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ne array;
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'[SEQ_SPLITTER]Sunday.

GREMIO:
Was ever match clapp'd up so sudd[SEQ_SPLITTER]enly?

BAPTISTA:
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a me[SEQ_SPLITTER]rchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt.

TRANIO:
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

B[SEQ_SPLITTER]APTISTA:
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]GREMIO:
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
Bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
Now is [SEQ_SPLITTER]the day we long have looked for:
I am your neighbo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur, and was suitor first.

TRANIO:
And I am one th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at love Bianca more
Than words can witness, or you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r thoughts can guess.

GREMIO:
Youngling, thou can[SEQ_SPLITTER]st not love so dear as I.

TRANIO:
Graybeard, thy [SEQ_SPLITTER]love doth freeze.

GREMIO:
But thine doth fry.
Ski[SEQ_SPLITTER]pper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.

TRANI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

BA[SEQ_SPLITTER]PTISTA:
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound th[SEQ_SPLITTER]is strife:
'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, [SEQ_SPLITTER]What can you assure her?

GREMIO:
First, as you kn[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow, my house within the city
Is richly furnished w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith plate and gold;
Basins and ewers to lave her d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ainty hands;
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]n ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss chests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, [SEQ_SPLITTER]tents, and canopies,
Fine linen, Turkey cushions b[SEQ_SPLITTER]oss'd with pearl,
Valance of Venice gold in needle[SEQ_SPLITTER]work,
Pewter and brass and all things that belong
[SEQ_SPLITTER]To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have [SEQ_SPLITTER]a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Sixscore fat oxe[SEQ_SPLITTER]n standing in my stalls,
And all things answerable[SEQ_SPLITTER] to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, I mus[SEQ_SPLITTER]t confess;
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]f whilst I live she will be only mine.

TRANIO:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather's heir and only son:
If I may have your daug[SEQ_SPLITTER]hter to my wife,
I'll leave her houses three or fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur as good,
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
Old[SEQ_SPLITTER] Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand[SEQ_SPLITTER] ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all be her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Sig[SEQ_SPLITTER]nior Gremio?

GREMIO:
Two thousand ducats by the y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ear of land!
My land amounts not to so much in all[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
That she shall have; besides an argosy
That now [SEQ_SPLITTER]is lying in Marseilles' road.
What, have I choked [SEQ_SPLITTER]you with an argosy?

TRANIO:
Gremio, 'tis known my[SEQ_SPLITTER] father hath no less
Than three great argosies; be[SEQ_SPLITTER]sides two galliases,
And twelve tight galleys: the[SEQ_SPLITTER]se I will assure her,
And twice as much, whate'er [SEQ_SPLITTER]thou offer'st next.

GREMIO:
Nay, I have offer'd a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll, I have no more;
And she can have no more than [SEQ_SPLITTER]all I have:
If you like me, she shall have me and [SEQ_SPLITTER]mine.

TRANIO:
Why, then the maid is mine from all[SEQ_SPLITTER] the world,
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed.

BAPTISTA:
I must confess your offer is the be[SEQ_SPLITTER]st;
And, let your father make her the assurance,
S[SEQ_SPLITTER]he is your own; else, you must pardon me,
if you s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hould die before him, where's her dower?

TRANIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

GREMIO:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd may not young men die, as well as old?

BAPTIST[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
Well, gentlemen,
I am thus resolved: on Sunday [SEQ_SPLITTER]next you know
My daughter Katharina is to be marri[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed:
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Be [SEQ_SPLITTER]bride to you, if you this assurance;
If not, Signi[SEQ_SPLITTER]or Gremio:
And so, I take my leave, and thank you [SEQ_SPLITTER]both.

GREMIO:
Adieu, good neighbour.
Now I fear t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee not:
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a[SEQ_SPLITTER] fool
To give thee all, and in his waning age
Set [SEQ_SPLITTER]foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
An old Italian f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ox is not so kind, my boy.

TRANIO:
A vengeance on[SEQ_SPLITTER] your crafty wither'd hide!
Yet I have faced it wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th a card of ten.
'Tis in my head to do my master [SEQ_SPLITTER]good:
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
Must g[SEQ_SPLITTER]et a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
And that[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their childre[SEQ_SPLITTER]n; but in this case of wooing,
A child shall get a[SEQ_SPLITTER] sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

LUCENTIO:
Fid[SEQ_SPLITTER]dler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
Have you[SEQ_SPLITTER] so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katha[SEQ_SPLITTER]rina welcomed you withal?

HORTENSIO:
But, wrangli[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng pedant, this is
The patroness of heavenly harmo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ny:
Then give me leave to have prerogative;
And wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]en in music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]all have leisure for as much.

LUCENTIO:
Preposter[SEQ_SPLITTER]ous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause [SEQ_SPLITTER]why music was ordain'd!
Was it not to refresh the [SEQ_SPLITTER]mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I [SEQ_SPLITTER]pause, serve in your harmony.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I will not bear these braves of thine.

BIANCA:
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]y, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
To strive fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r that which resteth in my choice:
I am no breechi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ng scholar in the schools;
I'll not be tied to hou[SEQ_SPLITTER]rs nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I p[SEQ_SPLITTER]lease myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit[SEQ_SPLITTER] we down:
Take you your instrument, play you the w[SEQ_SPLITTER]hiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned[SEQ_SPLITTER].

HORTENSIO:
You'll leave his lecture when I am i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n tune?

LUCENTIO:
That will be never: tune your i[SEQ_SPLITTER]nstrument.

BIANCA:
Where left we last?

LUCENTIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Here, madam:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tel[SEQ_SPLITTER]lus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIAN[SEQ_SPLITTER]CA:
Construe them.

LUCENTIO:
'Hic ibat,' as I tol[SEQ_SPLITTER]d you before, 'Simois,' I am
Lucentio, 'hic est,' [SEQ_SPLITTER]son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
'Sigeia tellus,' disgu[SEQ_SPLITTER]ised thus to get your love;
'Hic steterat,' and th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at Lucentio that comes
a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my m[SEQ_SPLITTER]an Tranio, 'regia,'
bearing my port, 'celsa senis,[SEQ_SPLITTER]' that we might
beguile the old pantaloon.

HORTEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]SIO:
Madam, my instrument's in tune.

BIANCA:
Let'[SEQ_SPLITTER]s hear. O fie! the treble jars.

LUCENTIO:
Spit in[SEQ_SPLITTER] the hole, man, and tune again.

BIANCA:
Now let m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Simois,' I k[SEQ_SPLITTER]now you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
trust you [SEQ_SPLITTER]not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
he hear us n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
despair n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, 'tis now in tune.

LUCENTIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
All but the base.

HORTENSIO:
The base is right;[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'tis the base knave that jars.
How fiery and forw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard our pedant is!
Now, for my life, the knave dot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h court my love:
Pedascule, I'll watch you better [SEQ_SPLITTER]yet.

BIANCA:
In time I may believe, yet I mistrus[SEQ_SPLITTER]t.

LUCENTIO:
Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.

BIANCA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] should be arguing still upon that doubt:
But let [SEQ_SPLITTER]it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters, take it[SEQ_SPLITTER] not unkindly, pray,
That I have been thus pleasan[SEQ_SPLITTER]t with you both.

HORTENSIO:
You may go walk, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]give me leave a while:
My lessons make no music in[SEQ_SPLITTER] three parts.

LUCENTIO:
Are you so formal, sir? w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ell, I must wait,
And watch withal; for, but I be [SEQ_SPLITTER]deceived,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.

HORT[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENSIO:
Madam, before you touch the instrument,
To [SEQ_SPLITTER]learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with[SEQ_SPLITTER] rudiments of art;
To teach you gamut in a briefer[SEQ_SPLITTER] sort,
More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
Than ha[SEQ_SPLITTER]th been taught by any of my trade:
And there it is[SEQ_SPLITTER] in writing, fairly drawn.

BIANCA:
Why, I am past[SEQ_SPLITTER] my gamut long ago.

HORTENSIO:
Yet read the gamut[SEQ_SPLITTER] of Hortensio.

BIANCA:

Servant:
Mistress, your f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather prays you leave your books
And help to dress[SEQ_SPLITTER] your sister's chamber up:
You know to-morrow is t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he wedding-day.

BIANCA:
Farewell, sweet masters b[SEQ_SPLITTER]oth; I must be gone.

LUCENTIO:
Faith, mistress, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen I have no cause to stay.

HORTENSIO:
But I hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e cause to pry into this pedant:
Methinks he looks[SEQ_SPLITTER] as though he were in love:
Yet if thy thoughts, B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ianca, be so humble
To cast thy wandering eyes on [SEQ_SPLITTER]every stale,
Seize thee that list: if once I find [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee ranging,
Hortensio will be quit with thee by [SEQ_SPLITTER]changing.

BAPTISTA:

KATHARINA:
No shame but mine[SEQ_SPLITTER]: I must, forsooth, be forced
To give my hand oppo[SEQ_SPLITTER]sed against my heart
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full[SEQ_SPLITTER] of spleen;
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at[SEQ_SPLITTER] leisure.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
Hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
And, to b[SEQ_SPLITTER]e noted for a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand, 'po[SEQ_SPLITTER]int the day of marriage,
Make feasts, invite frien[SEQ_SPLITTER]ds, and proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wed[SEQ_SPLITTER] where he hath woo'd.
Now must the world point at [SEQ_SPLITTER]poor Katharina,
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruch[SEQ_SPLITTER]io's wife,
If it would please him come and marry h[SEQ_SPLITTER]er!'

TRANIO:
Patience, good Katharina, and Baptis[SEQ_SPLITTER]ta too.
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
Wh[SEQ_SPLITTER]atever fortune stays him from his word:
Though he [SEQ_SPLITTER]be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be me[SEQ_SPLITTER]rry, yet withal he's honest.

KATHARINA:
Would Kat[SEQ_SPLITTER]harina had never seen him though!

BAPTISTA:
Go, g[SEQ_SPLITTER]irl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
For such an [SEQ_SPLITTER]injury would vex a very saint,
Much more a shrew o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f thy impatient humour.

BIONDELLO:
Master, master[SEQ_SPLITTER]! news, old news, and such news as
you never heard[SEQ_SPLITTER] of!

BAPTISTA:
Is it new and old too? how may tha[SEQ_SPLITTER]t be?

BIONDELLO:
Why, is it not news, to hear of [SEQ_SPLITTER]Petruchio's coming?

BAPTISTA:
Is he come?

BIONDE[SEQ_SPLITTER]LLO:
Why, no, sir.

BAPTISTA:
What then?

BIONDELL[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
He is coming.

BAPTISTA:
When will he be here?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BIONDELLO:
When he stands where I am and sees you[SEQ_SPLITTER] there.

TRANIO:
But say, what to thine old news?
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
BIONDELLO:
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat [SEQ_SPLITTER]and an old
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice t[SEQ_SPLITTER]urned, a pair
of boots that have been candle-cases[SEQ_SPLITTER], one buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword t[SEQ_SPLITTER]a'en out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]pped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no k[SEQ_SPLITTER]indred;
besides, possessed with the glanders and l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ike to mose
in the chine; troubled with the lampas[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, infected
with the fashions, full of wingdalls, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sped with
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f the fives,
stark spoiled with the staggers, begn[SEQ_SPLITTER]awn with the
bots, swayed in the back and shoulder[SEQ_SPLITTER]-shotten;
near-legged before and with, a half-cheq[SEQ_SPLITTER]ued bit
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, [SEQ_SPLITTER]being
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath [SEQ_SPLITTER]been
often burst and now repaired with knots; one [SEQ_SPLITTER]girth
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of vel[SEQ_SPLITTER]ure,
which hath two letters for her name fairly se[SEQ_SPLITTER]t down
in studs, and here and there pieced with pa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ckthread.

BAPTISTA:
Who comes with him?

BIONDELL[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd a
kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with [SEQ_SPLITTER]a red
and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of[SEQ_SPLITTER] forty
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a mons[SEQ_SPLITTER]ter, a
very monster in apparel, and not like a Chr[SEQ_SPLITTER]istian
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.

TRANIO:
'[SEQ_SPLITTER]Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Ye[SEQ_SPLITTER]t oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.

BAPTIST[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.

BIOND[SEQ_SPLITTER]ELLO:
Why, sir, he comes not.

BAPTISTA:
Didst tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u not say he comes?

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchi[SEQ_SPLITTER]o came?

BAPTISTA:
Ay, that Petruchio came.

BIOND[SEQ_SPLITTER]ELLO:
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on [SEQ_SPLITTER]his back.

BAPTISTA:
Why, that's all one.

BIONDEL[SEQ_SPLITTER]LO:
Nay, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you a penny,
A hors[SEQ_SPLITTER]e and a man
Is more than one,
And yet not many.

P[SEQ_SPLITTER]ETRUCHIO:
Come, where be these gallants? who's at [SEQ_SPLITTER]home?

BAPTISTA:
You are welcome, sir.

PETRUCHIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
And yet I come not well.

BAPTISTA:
And yet you h[SEQ_SPLITTER]alt not.

TRANIO:
Not so well apparell'd
As I wish[SEQ_SPLITTER] you were.

PETRUCHIO:
Were it better, I should ru[SEQ_SPLITTER]sh in thus.
But where is Kate? where is my lovely [SEQ_SPLITTER]bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you f[SEQ_SPLITTER]rown:
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
As i[SEQ_SPLITTER]f they saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or u[SEQ_SPLITTER]nusual prodigy?

BAPTISTA:
Why, sir, you know this[SEQ_SPLITTER] is your wedding-day:
First were we sad, fearing y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou would not come;
Now sadder, that you come so un[SEQ_SPLITTER]provided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your esta[SEQ_SPLITTER]te,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!

TRANIO:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd tells us, what occasion of import
Hath all so l[SEQ_SPLITTER]ong detain'd you from your wife,
And sent you hith[SEQ_SPLITTER]er so unlike yourself?

PETRUCHIO:
Tedious it were[SEQ_SPLITTER] to tell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am come t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o keep my word,
Though in some part enforced to di[SEQ_SPLITTER]gress;
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
As[SEQ_SPLITTER] you shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is [SEQ_SPLITTER]Kate? I stay too long from her:
The morning wears,[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'tis time we were at church.

TRANIO:
See not you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r bride in these unreverent robes:
Go to my chambe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r; Put on clothes of mine.

PETRUCHIO:
Not I, beli[SEQ_SPLITTER]eve me: thus I'll visit her.

BAPTISTA:
But thus, [SEQ_SPLITTER]I trust, you will not marry her.

PETRUCHIO:
Good [SEQ_SPLITTER]sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]o me she's married, not unto my clothes:
Could I r[SEQ_SPLITTER]epair what she will wear in me,
As I can change th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ese poor accoutrements,
'Twere well for Kate and b[SEQ_SPLITTER]etter for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h you,
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]And seal the title with a lovely kiss!

TRANIO:
He[SEQ_SPLITTER] hath some meaning in his mad attire:
We will pers[SEQ_SPLITTER]uade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he [SEQ_SPLITTER]go to church.

BAPTISTA:
I'll after him, and see t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he event of this.

TRANIO:
But to her love concern[SEQ_SPLITTER]eth us to add
Her father's liking: which to bring [SEQ_SPLITTER]to pass,
As I before unparted to your worship,
I a[SEQ_SPLITTER]m to get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not muc[SEQ_SPLITTER]h. we'll fit him to our turn,--
And he shall be Vi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ncentio of Pisa;
And make assurance here in Padua
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Of greater sums than I have promised.
So shall you[SEQ_SPLITTER] quietly enjoy your hope,
And marry sweet Bianca w[SEQ_SPLITTER]ith consent.

LUCENTIO:
Were it not that my fellow[SEQ_SPLITTER]-school-master
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrow[SEQ_SPLITTER]ly,
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll keep mine own, despite of all the world.

TRANI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch[SEQ_SPLITTER] our vantage in this business:
We'll over-reach th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Min[SEQ_SPLITTER]ola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y master's sake, Lucentio.
Signior Gremio, came yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u from the church?

GREMIO:
As willingly as e'er I[SEQ_SPLITTER] came from school.

TRANIO:
And is the bride and b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ridegroom coming home?

GREMIO:
A bridegroom say y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou? 'tis a groom indeed,
A grumbling groom, and th[SEQ_SPLITTER]at the girl shall find.

TRANIO:
Curster than she?[SEQ_SPLITTER] why, 'tis impossible.

GREMIO:
Why he's a devil, [SEQ_SPLITTER]a devil, a very fiend.

TRANIO:
Why, she's a devil[SEQ_SPLITTER], a devil, the devil's dam.

GREMIO:
Tut, she's a [SEQ_SPLITTER]lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you, Sir Lu[SEQ_SPLITTER]centio: when the priest
Should ask, if Katharina s[SEQ_SPLITTER]hould be his wife,
'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; [SEQ_SPLITTER]and swore so loud,
That, all-amazed, the priest le[SEQ_SPLITTER]t fall the book;
And, as he stoop'd again to take [SEQ_SPLITTER]it up,
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a [SEQ_SPLITTER]cuff
That down fell priest and book and book and p[SEQ_SPLITTER]riest:
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.[SEQ_SPLITTER]'

TRANIO:
What said the wench when he rose again?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

GREMIO:
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]and swore,
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But[SEQ_SPLITTER] after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: 'A[SEQ_SPLITTER] health!' quoth he, as if
He had been aboard, caro[SEQ_SPLITTER]using to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the [SEQ_SPLITTER]muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sexton's fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ce;
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew[SEQ_SPLITTER] thin and hungerly
And seem'd to ask him sops as h[SEQ_SPLITTER]e was drinking.
This done, he took the bride about[SEQ_SPLITTER] the neck
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s smack
That at the parting all the church did ech[SEQ_SPLITTER]o:
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]d marriage never was before:
Hark, hark! I hear th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e minstrels play.

PETRUCHIO:
Gentlemen and friend[SEQ_SPLITTER]s, I thank you for your pains:
I know you think to[SEQ_SPLITTER] dine with me to-day,
And have prepared great stor[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of wedding cheer;
But so it is, my haste doth ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my [SEQ_SPLITTER]leave.

BAPTISTA:
Is't possible you will away to-n[SEQ_SPLITTER]ight?

PETRUCHIO:
I must away to-day, before night[SEQ_SPLITTER] come:
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]nest company, I thank you all,
That have beheld me[SEQ_SPLITTER] give away myself
To this most patient, sweet and [SEQ_SPLITTER]virtuous wife:
Dine with my father, drink a health[SEQ_SPLITTER] to me;
For I must hence; and farewell to you all.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

TRANIO:
Let us entreat you stay till after dinne[SEQ_SPLITTER]r.

PETRUCHIO:
It may not be.

GREMIO:
Let me entr[SEQ_SPLITTER]eat you.

PETRUCHIO:
It cannot be.

KATHARINA:
Let[SEQ_SPLITTER] me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO:
I am content.

KATHAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]INA:
Are you content to stay?

PETRUCHIO:
I am con[SEQ_SPLITTER]tent you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, [SEQ_SPLITTER]entreat me how you can.

KATHARINA:
Now, if you lo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve me, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Grumio, my horse.

GRUMIO[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the [SEQ_SPLITTER]horses.

KATHARINA:
Nay, then,
Do what thou canst,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till[SEQ_SPLITTER] I please myself.
The door is open, sir; there lie[SEQ_SPLITTER]s your way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots a[SEQ_SPLITTER]re green;
For me, I'll not be gone till I please m[SEQ_SPLITTER]yself:
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
That take it on you at the first so roundly.

PET[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUCHIO:
O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angr[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.

KATHARINA:
I will be angry: what hast thou to [SEQ_SPLITTER]do?
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]REMIO:
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.

KAT[SEQ_SPLITTER]ARINA:
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]see a woman may be made a fool,
If she had not a s[SEQ_SPLITTER]pirit to resist.

PETRUCHIO:
They shall go forward[SEQ_SPLITTER], Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ttend on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
Be mad an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d merry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stam[SEQ_SPLITTER]p, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be master of what i[SEQ_SPLITTER]s mine own:
She is my goods, my chattels; she is m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y house,
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My[SEQ_SPLITTER] horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
And here she [SEQ_SPLITTER]stands, touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring mine ac[SEQ_SPLITTER]tion on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua[SEQ_SPLITTER]. Grumio,
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with[SEQ_SPLITTER] thieves;
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
F[SEQ_SPLITTER]ear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
thee, K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate:
I'll buckler thee against a million.

BAPTIST[SEQ_SPLITTER]A:
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

GREM[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
Went they not quickly, I should die with laugh[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing.

TRANIO:
Of all mad matches never was the lik[SEQ_SPLITTER]e.

LUCENTIO:
Mistress, what's your opinion of you[SEQ_SPLITTER]r sister?

BIANCA:
That, being mad herself, she's [SEQ_SPLITTER]madly mated.

GREMIO:
I warrant him, Petruchio is [SEQ_SPLITTER]Kated.

BAPTISTA:
Neighbours and friends, though b[SEQ_SPLITTER]ride and
bridegroom wants
For to supply the places[SEQ_SPLITTER] at the table,
You know there wants no junkets at [SEQ_SPLITTER]the feast.
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegro[SEQ_SPLITTER]om's place:
And let Bianca take her sister's room.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

TRANIO:
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride[SEQ_SPLITTER] it?

BAPTISTA:
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlem[SEQ_SPLITTER]en, let's go.

GRUMIO:
Fie, fie on all tired jades[SEQ_SPLITTER], on all mad masters, and
all foul ways! Was ever [SEQ_SPLITTER]man so beaten? was ever
man so rayed? was ever man[SEQ_SPLITTER] so weary? I am sent
before to make a fire, and th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ey are coming after to
warm them. Now, were not I [SEQ_SPLITTER]a little pot and soon
hot, my very lips might free[SEQ_SPLITTER]ze to my teeth, my
tongue to the roof of my mouth,[SEQ_SPLITTER] my heart in my
belly, ere I should come by a fire[SEQ_SPLITTER] to thaw me: but
I, with blowing the fire, shall w[SEQ_SPLITTER]arm myself; for,
considering the weather, a taller[SEQ_SPLITTER] man than I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.

CU[SEQ_SPLITTER]RTIS:
Who is that calls so coldly?

GRUMIO:
A piec[SEQ_SPLITTER]e of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
from [SEQ_SPLITTER]my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
but m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.

CURTIS:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER]s my master and his wife coming, Grumio?

GRUMIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
[SEQ_SPLITTER]on no water.

CURTIS:
Is she so hot a shrew as she[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s reported?

GRUMIO:
She was, good Curtis, before[SEQ_SPLITTER] this frost: but, thou
knowest, winter tames man, [SEQ_SPLITTER]woman and beast; for it
hath tamed my old master a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd my new mistress and
myself, fellow Curtis.

CUR[SEQ_SPLITTER]TIS:
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.

GR[SEQ_SPLITTER]UMIO:
Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ot; and
so long am I at the least. But wilt thou m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ake a
fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mis[SEQ_SPLITTER]tress,
whose hand, she being now at hand, thou sha[SEQ_SPLITTER]lt soon
feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow [SEQ_SPLITTER]in thy hot office?

CURTIS:
I prithee, good Grumio[SEQ_SPLITTER], tell me, how goes the world?

GRUMIO:
A cold wor[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
therefo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]ster and mistress are almost frozen to death.

CUR[SEQ_SPLITTER]TIS:
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumi[SEQ_SPLITTER]o, the news.

GRUMIO:
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd as much news as
will thaw.

CURTIS:
Come, you a[SEQ_SPLITTER]re so full of cony-catching!

GRUMIO:
Why, therefo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
Where's t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he cook? is supper ready, the house
trimmed, rushe[SEQ_SPLITTER]s strewed, cobwebs swept; the
serving-men in their[SEQ_SPLITTER] new fustian, their white
stockings, and every off[SEQ_SPLITTER]icer his wedding-garment on?
Be the jacks fair wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hin, the jills fair without,
the carpets laid, and[SEQ_SPLITTER] every thing in order?

CURTIS:
All ready; and the[SEQ_SPLITTER]refore, I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO:
First, know, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y horse is tired; my master and
mistress fallen ou[SEQ_SPLITTER]t.

CURTIS:
How?

GRUMIO:
Out of their saddles int[SEQ_SPLITTER]o the dirt; and thereby
hangs a tale.

CURTIS:
Let[SEQ_SPLITTER]'s ha't, good Grumio.

GRUMIO:
Lend thine ear.

CU[SEQ_SPLITTER]RTIS:
Here.

GRUMIO:
There.

CURTIS:
This is to fe[SEQ_SPLITTER]el a tale, not to hear a tale.

GRUMIO:
And theref[SEQ_SPLITTER]ore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
cuff was[SEQ_SPLITTER] but to knock at your ear, and beseech
listening. [SEQ_SPLITTER]Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
foul hill, m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y master riding behind my mistress,--

CURTIS:
Bot[SEQ_SPLITTER]h of one horse?

GRUMIO:
What's that to thee?

CUR[SEQ_SPLITTER]TIS:
Why, a horse.

GRUMIO:
Tell thou the tale: bu[SEQ_SPLITTER]t hadst thou not crossed me,
thou shouldst have he[SEQ_SPLITTER]ard how her horse fell and she
under her horse; th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou shouldst have heard in how
miry a place, how sh[SEQ_SPLITTER]e was bemoiled, how he left her
with the horse upo[SEQ_SPLITTER]n her, how he beat me because
her horse stumbled, [SEQ_SPLITTER]how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me[SEQ_SPLITTER], how he swore, how she prayed,
that never prayed [SEQ_SPLITTER]before, how I cried, how the
horses ran away, how [SEQ_SPLITTER]her bridle was burst, how I
lost my crupper, with [SEQ_SPLITTER]many things of worthy memory,
which now shall die [SEQ_SPLITTER]in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy g[SEQ_SPLITTER]rave.

CURTIS:
By this reckoning he is more shrew [SEQ_SPLITTER]than she.

GRUMIO:
Ay; and that thou and the proud[SEQ_SPLITTER]est of you all shall
find when he comes home. But [SEQ_SPLITTER]what talk I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: [SEQ_SPLITTER]let their heads be
sleekly combed their blue coats[SEQ_SPLITTER] brushed and their
garters of an indifferent knit:[SEQ_SPLITTER] let them curtsy
with their left legs and not pres[SEQ_SPLITTER]ume to touch a hair
of my master's horse-tail till[SEQ_SPLITTER] they kiss their
hands. Are they all ready?

CURTI[SEQ_SPLITTER]S:
They are.

GRUMIO:
Call them forth.

CURTIS:
Do[SEQ_SPLITTER] you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
countena[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce my mistress.

GRUMIO:
Why, she hath a face of [SEQ_SPLITTER]her own.

CURTIS:
Who knows not that?

GRUMIO:
Tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u, it seems, that calls for company to
countenance[SEQ_SPLITTER] her.

CURTIS:
I call them forth to credit her.

G[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUMIO:
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.

[SEQ_SPLITTER]NATHANIEL:
Welcome home, Grumio!

PHILIP:
How now,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Grumio!

JOSEPH:
What, Grumio!

NICHOLAS:
Fellow [SEQ_SPLITTER]Grumio!

NATHANIEL:
How now, old lad?

GRUMIO:
Wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]come, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
com[SEQ_SPLITTER]panions, is all ready, and all things neat?

NATHA[SEQ_SPLITTER]NIEL:
All things is ready. How near is our master?[SEQ_SPLITTER]

GRUMIO:
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and ther[SEQ_SPLITTER]efore be
not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my m[SEQ_SPLITTER]aster.

PETRUCHIO:
Where be these knaves? What, no[SEQ_SPLITTER] man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my hor[SEQ_SPLITTER]se!
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?

ALL SERV[SEQ_SPLITTER]ING-MEN:
Here, here, sir; here, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ere, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
You log[SEQ_SPLITTER]ger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
What, no attenda[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce? no regard? no duty?
Where is the foolish knav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e I sent before?

GRUMIO:
Here, sir; as foolish as[SEQ_SPLITTER] I was before.

PETRUCHIO:
You peasant swain! you [SEQ_SPLITTER]whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee mee[SEQ_SPLITTER]t me in the park,
And bring along these rascal kna[SEQ_SPLITTER]ves with thee?

GRUMIO:
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was[SEQ_SPLITTER] not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpi[SEQ_SPLITTER]nk'd i' the heel;
There was no link to colour Pete[SEQ_SPLITTER]r's hat,
And Walter's dagger was not come from she[SEQ_SPLITTER]athing:
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]Gregory;
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
PETRUCHIO:
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n.
Where is the life that late I led--
Where are t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hose--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
Sound, sound,[SEQ_SPLITTER] sound, sound!
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet K[SEQ_SPLITTER]ate, be merry.
Off with my boots, you rogues! you [SEQ_SPLITTER]villains, when?
It was the friar of orders grey,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]s he forth walked on his way:--
Out, you rogue! yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u pluck my foot awry:
Take that, and mend the pluc[SEQ_SPLITTER]king off the other.
Be merry, Kate. Some water, he[SEQ_SPLITTER]re; what, ho!
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, [SEQ_SPLITTER]get you hence,
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ther:
One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquai[SEQ_SPLITTER]nted with.
Where are my slippers? Shall I have som[SEQ_SPLITTER]e water?
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartil[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?

KA[SEQ_SPLITTER]THARINA:
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwil[SEQ_SPLITTER]ling.

PETRUCHIO:
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-e[SEQ_SPLITTER]ar'd knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have [SEQ_SPLITTER]a stomach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or el[SEQ_SPLITTER]se shall I?
What's this? mutton?

First Servant:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]y.

PETRUCHIO:
Who brought it?

PETER:
I.

PETRUCH[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
What dogs [SEQ_SPLITTER]are these! Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you[SEQ_SPLITTER], villains, bring it from the dresser,
And serve i[SEQ_SPLITTER]t thus to me that love it not?
Theretake it to you[SEQ_SPLITTER], trenchers, cups, and all;
You heedless joltheads[SEQ_SPLITTER] and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble? I'll[SEQ_SPLITTER] be with you straight.

KATHARINA:
I pray you, hus[SEQ_SPLITTER]band, be not so disquiet:
The meat was well, if yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u were so contented.

PETRUCHIO:
I tell thee, Kate[SEQ_SPLITTER], 'twas burnt and dried away;
And I expressly am f[SEQ_SPLITTER]orbid to touch it,
For it engenders choler, plante[SEQ_SPLITTER]th anger;
And better 'twere that both of us did fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]st,
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]han feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patie[SEQ_SPLITTER]nt; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
And, for this ni[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght, we'll fast for company:
Come, I will bring th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee to thy bridal chamber.

NATHANIEL:
Peter, didst[SEQ_SPLITTER] ever see the like?

PETER:
He kills her in her ow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n humour.

GRUMIO:
Where is he?

CURTIS:
In her ch[SEQ_SPLITTER]amber, making a sermon of continency to her;
And r[SEQ_SPLITTER]ails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd sits as one new-risen from a dream.
Away, away![SEQ_SPLITTER] for he is coming hither.

PETRUCHIO:
Thus have I [SEQ_SPLITTER]politicly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end [SEQ_SPLITTER]successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing e[SEQ_SPLITTER]mpty;
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Anothe[SEQ_SPLITTER]r way I have to man my haggard,
To make her come a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd know her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, [SEQ_SPLITTER]as we watch these kites
That bate and beat and wil[SEQ_SPLITTER]l not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor non[SEQ_SPLITTER]e shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-nigh[SEQ_SPLITTER]t she shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved[SEQ_SPLITTER] fault
I'll find about the making of the bed;
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
Thi[SEQ_SPLITTER]s way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
Ay, an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in rev[SEQ_SPLITTER]erend care of her;
And in conclusion she shall wat[SEQ_SPLITTER]ch all night:
And if she chance to nod I'll rail a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd brawl
And with the clamour keep her still awake[SEQ_SPLITTER].
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
And [SEQ_SPLITTER]thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
He t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him [SEQ_SPLITTER]speak: 'tis charity to show.

TRANIO:
Is't possibl[SEQ_SPLITTER]e, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy a[SEQ_SPLITTER]ny other but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears [SEQ_SPLITTER]me fair in hand.

HORTENSIO:
Sir, to satisfy you i[SEQ_SPLITTER]n what I have said,
Stand by and mark the manner o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f his teaching.

LUCENTIO:
Now, mistress, profit y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou in what you read?

BIANCA:
What, master, read y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou? first resolve me that.

LUCENTIO:
I read that [SEQ_SPLITTER]I profess, the Art to Love.

BIANCA:
And may you p[SEQ_SPLITTER]rove, sir, master of your art!

LUCENTIO:
While yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!

HORTEN[SEQ_SPLITTER]SIO:
Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray[SEQ_SPLITTER],
You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
Lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed none in the world so well as Lucentio.

TRANIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
I tell t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hee, Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIO:
Mistake[SEQ_SPLITTER] no more: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I see[SEQ_SPLITTER]m to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disgui[SEQ_SPLITTER]se,
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
And make[SEQ_SPLITTER]s a god of such a cullion:
Know, sir, that I am ca[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll'd Hortensio.

TRANIO:
Signior Hortensio, I have[SEQ_SPLITTER] often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear B[SEQ_SPLITTER]ianca and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO:
See, how [SEQ_SPLITTER]they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my [SEQ_SPLITTER]hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her no mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re, but do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ormer favours
That I have fondly flatter'd her wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]hal.

TRANIO:
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!

[SEQ_SPLITTER]HORTENSIO:
Would all the world but he had quite fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]rsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
[SEQ_SPLITTER]I will be married to a wealthy widow,
Ere three da[SEQ_SPLITTER]ys pass, which hath as long loved me
As I have lov[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell,[SEQ_SPLITTER] Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their be[SEQ_SPLITTER]auteous looks,
Shall win my love: and so I take my[SEQ_SPLITTER] leave,
In resolution as I swore before.

TRANIO:
[SEQ_SPLITTER]Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'lon[SEQ_SPLITTER]geth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have ta'en [SEQ_SPLITTER]you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you wi[SEQ_SPLITTER]th Hortensio.

BIANCA:
Tranio, you jest: but have [SEQ_SPLITTER]you both forsworn me?

TRANIO:
Mistress, we have.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
LUCENTIO:
Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO:
I' f[SEQ_SPLITTER]aith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be [SEQ_SPLITTER]wood and wedded in a day.

BIANCA:
God give him jo[SEQ_SPLITTER]y!

TRANIO:
Ay, and he'll tame her.

BIANCA:
He sa[SEQ_SPLITTER]ys so, Tranio.

TRANIO:
Faith, he is gone unto the[SEQ_SPLITTER] taming-school.

BIANCA:
The taming-school! what, [SEQ_SPLITTER]is there such a place?

TRANIO:
Ay, mistress, and [SEQ_SPLITTER]Petruchio is the master;
That teacheth tricks elev[SEQ_SPLITTER]en and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her [SEQ_SPLITTER]chattering tongue.

BIONDELLO:
O master, master, I[SEQ_SPLITTER] have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at [SEQ_SPLITTER]last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill[SEQ_SPLITTER],
Will serve the turn.

TRANIO:
What is he, Bionde[SEQ_SPLITTER]llo?

BIONDELLO:
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant[SEQ_SPLITTER],
I know not what; but format in apparel,
In gait [SEQ_SPLITTER]and countenance surely like a father.

LUCENTIO:
A[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd what of him, Tranio?

TRANIO:
If he be credulou[SEQ_SPLITTER]s and trust my tale,
I'll make him glad to seem Vi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ncentio,
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
As[SEQ_SPLITTER] if he were the right Vincentio
Take in your love,[SEQ_SPLITTER] and then let me alone.

Pedant:
God save you, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER]!

TRANIO:
And you, sir! you are welcome.
Travel y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou far on, or are you at the farthest?

Pedant:
Si[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, at the farthest for a week or two:
But then up [SEQ_SPLITTER]farther, and as for as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if[SEQ_SPLITTER] God lend me life.

TRANIO:
What countryman, I pra[SEQ_SPLITTER]y?

Pedant:
Of Mantua.

TRANIO:
Of Mantua, sir? ma[SEQ_SPLITTER]rry, God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur life?

Pedant:
My life, sir! how, I pray? for t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hat goes hard.

TRANIO:
'Tis death for any one in [SEQ_SPLITTER]Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
For [SEQ_SPLITTER]private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
Hath pub[SEQ_SPLITTER]lish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but[SEQ_SPLITTER] that you are but newly come,
You might have heard[SEQ_SPLITTER] it else proclaim'd about.

Pedant:
Alas! sir, it [SEQ_SPLITTER]is worse for me than so;
For I have bills for mone[SEQ_SPLITTER]y by exchange
From Florence and must here deliver [SEQ_SPLITTER]them.

TRANIO:
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This[SEQ_SPLITTER] will I do, and this I will advise you:
First, tel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l me, have you ever been at Pisa?

Pedant:
Ay, sir[SEQ_SPLITTER], in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for gra[SEQ_SPLITTER]ve citizens.

TRANIO:
Among them know you one Vinc[SEQ_SPLITTER]entio?

Pedant:
I know him not, but I have heard o[SEQ_SPLITTER]f him;
A merchant of incomparable wealth.

TRANIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In count[SEQ_SPLITTER]enance somewhat doth resemble you.

BIONDELLO:

TR[SEQ_SPLITTER]ANIO:
To save your life in this extremity,
This fa[SEQ_SPLITTER]vour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not [SEQ_SPLITTER]the worst of an your fortunes
That you are like to[SEQ_SPLITTER] Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you unde[SEQ_SPLITTER]rtake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodge[SEQ_SPLITTER]d:
Look that you take upon you as you should;
You [SEQ_SPLITTER]understand me, sir: so shall you stay
Till you hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e done your business in the city:
If this be court[SEQ_SPLITTER]esy, sir, accept of it.

Pedant:
O sir, I do; and [SEQ_SPLITTER]will repute you ever
The patron of my life and lib[SEQ_SPLITTER]erty.

TRANIO:
Then go with me to make the matter [SEQ_SPLITTER]good.
This, by the way, I let you understand;
my f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ather is here look'd for every day,
To pass assura[SEQ_SPLITTER]nce of a dower in marriage
'Twixt me and one Bapti[SEQ_SPLITTER]sta's daughter here:
In all these circumstances I'[SEQ_SPLITTER]ll instruct you:
Go with me to clothe you as becom[SEQ_SPLITTER]es you.

GRUMIO:
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for [SEQ_SPLITTER]my life.

KATHARINA:
The more my wrong, the more h[SEQ_SPLITTER]is spite appears:
What, did he marry me to famish [SEQ_SPLITTER]me?
Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
Upon[SEQ_SPLITTER] entreaty have a present aims;
If not, elsewhere t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hey meet with charity:
But I, who never knew how t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o entreat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
Wit[SEQ_SPLITTER]h oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
And that[SEQ_SPLITTER] which spites me more than all these wants,
He doe[SEQ_SPLITTER]s it under name of perfect love;
As who should say[SEQ_SPLITTER], if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness[SEQ_SPLITTER] or else present death.
I prithee go and get me so[SEQ_SPLITTER]me repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome foo[SEQ_SPLITTER]d.

GRUMIO:
What say you to a neat's foot?

KATHAR[SEQ_SPLITTER]INA:
'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
GRUMIO:
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
How say[SEQ_SPLITTER] you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

KATHARINA:
I [SEQ_SPLITTER]like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.

GRUMIO:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
What say you t[SEQ_SPLITTER]o a piece of beef and mustard?

KATHARINA:
A dish [SEQ_SPLITTER]that I do love to feed upon.

GRUMIO:
Ay, but the [SEQ_SPLITTER]mustard is too hot a little.

KATHARINA:
Why then,[SEQ_SPLITTER] the beef, and let the mustard rest.

GRUMIO:
Nay [SEQ_SPLITTER]then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
Or e[SEQ_SPLITTER]lse you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA:
Then bo[SEQ_SPLITTER]th, or one, or any thing thou wilt.

GRUMIO:
Why t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hen, the mustard without the beef.

KATHARINA:
Go,[SEQ_SPLITTER] get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
That fe[SEQ_SPLITTER]ed'st me with the very name of meat:
Sorrow on the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e and all the pack of you,
That triumph thus upon [SEQ_SPLITTER]my misery!
Go, get thee gone, I say.

PETRUCHIO:
H[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

HORT[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENSIO:
Mistress, what cheer?

KATHARINA:
Faith, as[SEQ_SPLITTER] cold as can be.

PETRUCHIO:
Pluck up thy spirits;[SEQ_SPLITTER] look cheerfully upon me.
Here love; thou see'st h[SEQ_SPLITTER]ow diligent I am
To dress thy meat myself and brin[SEQ_SPLITTER]g it thee:
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness me[SEQ_SPLITTER]rits thanks.
What, not a word? Nay, then thou love[SEQ_SPLITTER]st it not;
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Here, take away this dish.

KATHARINA:
I pray you[SEQ_SPLITTER], let it stand.

PETRUCHIO:
The poorest service is[SEQ_SPLITTER] repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you[SEQ_SPLITTER] touch the meat.

KATHARINA:
I thank you, sir.

HO[SEQ_SPLITTER]RTENSIO:
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.

PETR[SEQ_SPLITTER]UCHIO:

Haberdasher:
Here is the cap your worship [SEQ_SPLITTER]did bespeak.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, this was moulded on [SEQ_SPLITTER]a porringer;
A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd an[SEQ_SPLITTER]d filthy:
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
A [SEQ_SPLITTER]knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
Away with it![SEQ_SPLITTER] come, let me have a bigger.

KATHARINA:
I'll have[SEQ_SPLITTER] no bigger: this doth fit the time,
And gentlewome[SEQ_SPLITTER]n wear such caps as these

PETRUCHIO:
When you are[SEQ_SPLITTER] gentle, you shall have one too,
And not till then[SEQ_SPLITTER].

HORTENSIO:

KATHARINA:
Why, sir, I trust I may [SEQ_SPLITTER]have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no chi[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld, no babe:
Your betters have endured me say my m[SEQ_SPLITTER]ind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
M[SEQ_SPLITTER]y tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else [SEQ_SPLITTER]my heart concealing it will break,
And rather than[SEQ_SPLITTER] it shall, I will be free
Even to the uttermost, a[SEQ_SPLITTER]s I please, in words.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, thou say'st[SEQ_SPLITTER] true; it is a paltry cap,
A custard-coffin, a bau[SEQ_SPLITTER]ble, a silken pie:
I love thee well, in that thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]likest it not.

KATHARINA:
Love me or love me not,[SEQ_SPLITTER] I like the cap;
And it I will have, or I will hav[SEQ_SPLITTER]e none.

PETRUCHIO:
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, let us see't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff[SEQ_SPLITTER] is here?
What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-[SEQ_SPLITTER]cannon:
What, up and down, carved like an apple-ta[SEQ_SPLITTER]rt?
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slas[SEQ_SPLITTER]h,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
Why, what,[SEQ_SPLITTER] i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?

HORT[SEQ_SPLITTER]ENSIO:

Tailor:
You bid me make it orderly and wel[SEQ_SPLITTER]l,
According to the fashion and the time.

PETRUCH[SEQ_SPLITTER]IO:
Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
I di[SEQ_SPLITTER]d not bid you mar it to the time.
Go, hop me over [SEQ_SPLITTER]every kennel home,
For you shall hop without my cu[SEQ_SPLITTER]stom, sir:
I'll none of it: hence! make your best [SEQ_SPLITTER]of it.

KATHARINA:
I never saw a better-fashion'd [SEQ_SPLITTER]gown,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commend[SEQ_SPLITTER]able:
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.

PET[SEQ_SPLITTER]RUCHIO:
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of th[SEQ_SPLITTER]ee.

Tailor:
She says your worship means to make
a[SEQ_SPLITTER] puppet of her.

PETRUCHIO:
O monstrous arrogance![SEQ_SPLITTER] Thou liest, thou thread,
thou thimble,
Thou yard,[SEQ_SPLITTER] three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou fl[SEQ_SPLITTER]ea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Braved in [SEQ_SPLITTER]mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou [SEQ_SPLITTER]rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall so be[SEQ_SPLITTER]-mete thee with thy yard
As thou shalt think on pr[SEQ_SPLITTER]ating whilst thou livest!
I tell thee, I, that tho[SEQ_SPLITTER]u hast marr'd her gown.

Tailor:
Your worship is d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eceived; the gown is made
Just as my master had di[SEQ_SPLITTER]rection:
Grumio gave order how it should be done.
[SEQ_SPLITTER]
GRUMIO:
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff[SEQ_SPLITTER].

Tailor:
But how did you desire it should be mad[SEQ_SPLITTER]e?

GRUMIO:
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.

T[SEQ_SPLITTER]ailor:
But did you not request to have it cut?

GR[SEQ_SPLITTER]UMIO:
Thou hast faced many things.

Tailor:
I have[SEQ_SPLITTER].

GRUMIO:
Face not me: thou hast braved many men;[SEQ_SPLITTER] brave not
me; I will neither be faced nor braved.[SEQ_SPLITTER] I say unto
thee, I bid thy master cut out the gow[SEQ_SPLITTER]n; but I did
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hou liest.

Tailor:
Why, here is the note of the f[SEQ_SPLITTER]ashion to testify

PETRUCHIO:
Read it.

GRUMIO:
Th[SEQ_SPLITTER]e note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.

Tai[SEQ_SPLITTER]lor:

GRUMIO:
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied [SEQ_SPLITTER]gown, sew me in
the skirts of it, and beat me to d[SEQ_SPLITTER]eath with a bottom
of brown thread: I said a gown.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

PETRUCHIO:
Proceed.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess [SEQ_SPLITTER]the cape.

Tailor:

GRUMIO:
I confess two sleeves.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

Tailor:

PETRUCHIO:
Ay, there's the villany.

GR[SEQ_SPLITTER]UMIO:
Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
sewed[SEQ_SPLITTER] up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,
though t[SEQ_SPLITTER]hy little finger be armed in a thimble.

Tailor:
T[SEQ_SPLITTER]his is true that I say: an I had thee
in place whe[SEQ_SPLITTER]re, thou shouldst know it.

GRUMIO:
I am for thee [SEQ_SPLITTER]straight: take thou the
bill, give me thy mete-yar[SEQ_SPLITTER]d, and spare not me.

HORTENSIO:
God-a-mercy, Grum[SEQ_SPLITTER]io! then he shall have no odds.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

GRUMIO:
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.

PE[SEQ_SPLITTER]TRUCHIO:
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.

GR[SEQ_SPLITTER]UMIO:
Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistre[SEQ_SPLITTER]ss'
gown for thy master's use!

PETRUCHIO:
Why, si[SEQ_SPLITTER]r, what's your conceit in that?

GRUMIO:
O, sir, t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he conceit is deeper than you think for:
Take up m[SEQ_SPLITTER]y mistress' gown to his master's use!
O, fie, fie,[SEQ_SPLITTER] fie!

PETRUCHIO:

HORTENSIO:
Tailor, I'll pay the[SEQ_SPLITTER]e for thy gown tomorrow:
Take no unkindness of his[SEQ_SPLITTER] hasty words:
Away! I say; commend me to thy maste[SEQ_SPLITTER]r.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, come, my Kate; we will unto y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our father's
Even in these honest mean habiliments[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
Fo[SEQ_SPLITTER]r 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
And as t[SEQ_SPLITTER]he sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
So honou[SEQ_SPLITTER]r peereth in the meanest habit.
What is the jay mo[SEQ_SPLITTER]re precious than the lark,
Because his fathers are[SEQ_SPLITTER] more beautiful?
Or is the adder better than the e[SEQ_SPLITTER]el,
Because his painted skin contents the eye?
O, [SEQ_SPLITTER]no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
For this[SEQ_SPLITTER] poor furniture and mean array.
if thou account'st[SEQ_SPLITTER] it shame. lay it on me;
And therefore frolic: we [SEQ_SPLITTER]will hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy[SEQ_SPLITTER] father's house.
Go, call my men, and let us strai[SEQ_SPLITTER]ght to him;
And bring our horses unto Long-lane en[SEQ_SPLITTER]d;
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot
L[SEQ_SPLITTER]et's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And[SEQ_SPLITTER] well we may come there by dinner-time.

KATHARINA[SEQ_SPLITTER]:
I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
And 'tw[SEQ_SPLITTER]ill be supper-time ere you come there.

PETRUCHIO:[SEQ_SPLITTER]
It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
Look, what I[SEQ_SPLITTER] speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still cross[SEQ_SPLITTER]ing it. Sirs, let't alone:
I will not go to-day; a[SEQ_SPLITTER]nd ere I do,
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.[SEQ_SPLITTER]

HORTENSIO:

TRANIO:
Sir, this is the house: plea[SEQ_SPLITTER]se it you that I call?

Pedant:
Ay, what else? and[SEQ_SPLITTER] but I be deceived
Signior Baptista may remember m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e,
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were [SEQ_SPLITTER]lodgers at the Pegasus.

TRANIO:
'Tis well; and ho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ld your own, in any case,
With such austerity as '[SEQ_SPLITTER]longeth to a father.

Pedant:
I warrant you.
But, [SEQ_SPLITTER]sir, here comes your boy;
'Twere good he were scho[SEQ_SPLITTER]ol'd.

TRANIO:
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,[SEQ_SPLITTER]
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
Imagine[SEQ_SPLITTER] 'twere the right Vincentio.

BIONDELLO:
Tut, fear[SEQ_SPLITTER] not me.

TRANIO:
But hast thou done thy errand to[SEQ_SPLITTER] Baptista?

BIONDELLO:
I told him that your father[SEQ_SPLITTER] was at Venice,
And that you look'd for him this d[SEQ_SPLITTER]ay in Padua.

TRANIO:
Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold [SEQ_SPLITTER]thee that to drink.
Here comes Baptista: set your [SEQ_SPLITTER]countenance, sir.
Signior Baptista, you are happil[SEQ_SPLITTER]y met.
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
I[SEQ_SPLITTER] pray you stand good father to me now,
Give me Bia[SEQ_SPLITTER]nca for my patrimony.

Pedant:
Soft son!
Sir, by y[SEQ_SPLITTER]our leave: having come to Padua
To gather in some [SEQ_SPLITTER]debts, my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a w[SEQ_SPLITTER]eighty cause
Of love between your daughter and him[SEQ_SPLITTER]self:
And, for the good report I hear of you
And f[SEQ_SPLITTER]or the love he beareth to your daughter
And she to[SEQ_SPLITTER] him, to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a[SEQ_SPLITTER] good father's care,
To have him match'd; and if y[SEQ_SPLITTER]ou please to like
No worse than I, upon some agree[SEQ_SPLITTER]ment
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one [SEQ_SPLITTER]consent to have her so bestow'd;
For curious I can[SEQ_SPLITTER]not be with you,
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear [SEQ_SPLITTER]so well.

BAPTISTA:
Sir, pardon me in what I have [SEQ_SPLITTER]to say:
Your plainness and your shortness please m[SEQ_SPLITTER]e well.
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
D[SEQ_SPLITTER]oth love my daughter and she loveth him,
Or both d[SEQ_SPLITTER]issemble deeply their affections:
And therefore, i[SEQ_SPLITTER]f you say no more than this,
That like a father yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]u will deal with him
And pass my daughter a suffic[SEQ_SPLITTER]ient dower,
The match is made, and all is done:
Yo[SEQ_SPLITTER]ur son shall have my daughter with consent.

TRANI[SEQ_SPLITTER]O:
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
W[SEQ_SPLITTER]
