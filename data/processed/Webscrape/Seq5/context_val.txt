* I can give you a reason.
Give it then, so we can call you both a pimp and an idiot, which would not be any worse than what you are now.
What is a pimp, fool?
A fool that wears nice clothes, not unlike you. He can change appearances. Sometimes he looks like a lord, and sometimes he looks like lawyer. Sometimes, he looks like a philosopher with two testicles to add to the stone he uses for alchemy. A lot of times he looks like a knight, but generally he sticks to the appearances men take between the ages of 13 and 80.
You're not a complete fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And you're definitely not the brightest bulb on the tree. As much as I am a fool, that's how much intelligence you lack.
That response could have come from my own mouth.
Move away, here comes Lord Timon.
Let's go, fool.
I do not always stick to lovers, women, and rich men. Sometimes I hang out with philosophers!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To TIMON] Let's walk and talk.
I'm shocked. Why did you not tell me about all of the debts, so I could cut off my spending?
I brought it up many times. You didn't listen to me.
No way! Maybe you took some small opportunities to mention it to me, and you took my deafness on a few occasions as an excuse not to ask me ever again.
Oh no, I showed you the numbers several times and put them right in front of you. You would throw them away and say you had me look at them. I have said no and cried when you offered huge amounts of money in return for small gifts, and I have told you to be tighter with your wallet, so bluntly that it was almost rude. I faced many hard outbursts of yours when I told you about your shrinking estate and your growing debts. Now that you are listening to me it's too late, and still I have to tell you that all your money will only pay half of all that you owe.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sell all my land.
It's all mortgaged, and some of it already sold. What's left won't even come close to paying off everyone. And what are we going to do about the even greater number of creditors that will approach us soon? What can we do in the long run?
My land extended all the way to Sparta.
But sir, you would have given the entire world in one breath. Your holdings shrank so quickly!
You are telling the truth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you think that my management has been poor or dishonest, have me inspected by the strictest auditors to prove my integrity. This is how the gods reward me, when greedy freeloaders have eaten everything in the kitchen and drunk all the wine, and when hired musicians have been made to occupy and light up every room in the house. I have given myself up to wastefulness and now all I can do is cry about it.
Please stop.
And yet I have not touched on how loose you've been with your money! How many delicacies have poor men eaten tonight on your account? Who does not seem to belong to Timon? Is there anything in the world that you have not claimed as your own to give? They have called you great, noble, worthy, and royal, but when all you have to buy compliments is gone, there will be no praise left. What is quickly made is quickly lost, and these men will disappear like flies after seeing one winter cloud.
Don't preach to me. I have not done a single bad thing in giving these gifts, for they were imprudently, not dishonorably, given. Why are you so upset? Can't you see that I have all the friends in the world? Don't worry, because if I could appeal to those who have received so much from me in love and work to inspire their sympathy, other men and their fortunes will prove themselves available to me. One word and someone will lend to me.
I hope you're right.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In a way, these debts are a blessing in disguise, because this way I can see who my real friends are. You'll see how wrong you are about their loyalty to me—I have many friends! Come here Flaminius, Servilius!
Hello?
[Pointing to different servants] I will split you all up and send you to Lord Lucius, you to Lord Lucullus, my hunting-partner today, and you to Sempronius. Tell them you come from me, and due to extenuating circumstances I could use their help and some money. Ask for fifty talents from each.
Whatever you say.
[To himself] He's going to ask Lucius and Lucullus, of all people?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To FLAVIUS] You go to the senators. I deserve an audience with them. Ask them to send me a thousand talents.
I have used your badge as sign of my authority to act for you and approached them aggressively asking for money. They said no, and I came back with no more than I left with.
That can't be true!
They answered in unison that they would like to help, but do not have enough to spare. They did say they were sorry and that they liked you, and that they had no idea anything was wrong with your estate. They lamented that even the noblest men can come upon bad luck, wished life were better, and said it was all so sad. Then they moved on to what they said were more serious matters, and shared looks of disgust and hard, half-uttered sentences. Then they were so gruff with their grudging salutes and cold nods that I was shocked into silence.
I hope the gods give them what they deserve! But calm down, those old cronies have ingratitude in their DNA. Their blood is thick and runs slow and cold. They do not have the warmth to be kind. And they must act as their nature dictates, dull and heavy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go to Ventidius.
Please cheer up. You are a good man, and I don't blame you.
Ventidius just held his father's funeral, who died and left him heir to an enormous fortune. When he was poor and had no one to turn to, I gave him five talents. Go to him for me and ask that his friend needs him right now, and hopes that he remembers those five talents.
Now that that's done, give these men what they are due right now. Don't say or even imagine that my friends will fail me.
I wish I could unthink it. The idea that some will fail you is the enemy of generosity, because once it gets out that some are withholding their money, everyone will do the same.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I told Lucullus that you were here. He'll be in soon.
Thanks.
There he is.
[To himself] Is this one of Timon's servants? Great! I dreamt last night of expensive gifts. [To FLAMINIUS] Welcome, Flaminius. [To the SERVANT] Go get some wine for us.
How is your master Timon? He's so honest and generous.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is healthy.
It's important to be healthy. What do you have under your cloak, Flaminius?
Nothing, just an empty box, which Timon asked that I beg you fill with some money. He could really use fifty talents, and thinks you would be kind enough to lend him that money. He thinks without a doubt you will assist him.
Ha ha ha! He thinks so? He's a very nice guy, but he has spent too much money. I came over several times for dinner and told him to be more thrifty, but he would never listen or heed my warnings. No one is perfect, and his vice is generosity. I told him so, but never could change his ways.
Here's the wine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I always thought you were smart, Flaminius. Take this.
Timon says the same.
I always thought you were an able and efficient guy who—to give you your due credit—knows how to be reasonable. I always imagined that instead of being swept up in circumstance you'd be able to see an opportunity when it presented itself. These are good traits.
Leave and give us a moment.
Come closer to me Flaminius. Your lord is a generous man, but you are smart and know as well as anybody, even though you've come to me, that now is not the time to lend money, especially to friends, without some kind of insurance. Here are three coins. This way you can say that you never visited me and I did not reject your request for a loan. Goodbye.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is it really possible that such bad men can exist when there are good ones too? You and your money sicken me.
Ah, now I can tell that you're as dumb as Timon.
I hope those coins melt into a burning hot liquid and scald you! You make me sick. Is friendship really such a flimsy thing that it can break in less than two nights? God! I am offended for Timon. This idiot has eaten at his table, and what he ate should not have nourished him, but poisoned him! I hope he gets a fatal disease , and that whatever part of him existed thanks to eating Timon's food works to make his suffering even more painful.
You're talking about Timon? He is my friend and a good guy.
We've heard as much, even though we've never met the man. Still, I can tell you something else which I've heard as a rumor: Timon's best days are behind him, and his estate is shrinking beyond his control.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Psh, no, don't believe the rumors. He has plenty of money.
But, my lord, believe this: one of his men went to the Lord Lucullus to ask for that much. Really, he begged desperately for it, showing just how much he really needed it, and still he was rejected.
No way!
Yes, totally rejected.
That is so weird! God as my witness, I am ashamed to hear that such an honorable man was denied a loan. There is no honor at all in that, and when I think of myself, I must say I have received many gifts from him: money, silver, jewels, and other things—though nothing compared to what he gave Lucullus. If Timon had foregone Lucullus and asked me for a loan, I never would have denied him so much.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There you are, my lord, I've been look all over for you. My lord—
Servilius! It's good to see you. Please, bring me to Timon, my good friend.
If you are willing, Timon sent—
Ha! What gift has he sent me? I owe that man so much, since he's always giving me gifts. How do you think I should thank him? What has he sent me?
Only me to state his current state of affairs, and to ask you to lend him some money.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Timon must be joking. There's no way he needs fifty five hundred talents.
For now he wants less. I wouldn't speak with such urgency about this if it were a joke.
You're serious?
Yes, I swear.
I'm a horrible man for accepting all those gifts from Timon, when I could have been better! I gave up the opportunity to be a good man for something that brings me no honor! Servilius, I swear to god that I cannot help. I was actually going to send someone to borrow from Timon, and these men here will back me up. I swear on all the wealth of Athens! Tell Timon what I've said. I hope he will think of me well, even if I cannot help him. Tell him that it pains me more than anything else that I cannot aid such a good man. Servilius, would you be a good friend to me and tell him this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, I will.
I wish you the best, Servilius!
It's as you said, Timon is poor. And someone who is denied once does not have much hope of prospering.
Did you see that, Hostilius?
Yes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That's what the world is like, and every flatterer is the same. What is a friend who takes so much? Timon was so good to Lucilius, and kept him afloat with his own money. It's Timon who paid for his servants, and he never enjoys anything that does not owe itself to him. But how monstrous he looks for being so ungrateful! He denies him what rich men would give to beggars.
It's unholy.
I myself have never received anything from Timon, and am not his friend. But I swear on all of his good qualities that if he approached me for money, I would have given him something. I like him that much. Men don't know how to give and value shrewd money-making over their conscience.
Should Timon really have to struggle for this? He could go to Lord Lucius or Lucullus for a loan, and he could also call on the rich Ventidius, who is free from prison thanks to Timon. All these men owe some of their wealth to Timon.
All those men must be under some wicked influence, because they all denied him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No way! Ventidius and Lucullus denied him? Has he approached me for a loan? It shows little Timon's friends loved him that all three of these men refused him, and now I must be his last hope! All his friends benefitted from the charity that leaves him without money, and now leave him for broke like doctor does a case he has deemed helpless. Must I now try to cure him of his debts? What a disgrace and an unenviable position for me! I cannot understand why he did not come to me first—I was the first to receive a gift from him, after all. Does he think so poorly of me as to believe I would be the last to repay him? No, and that way I'll have reason to laugh at him and all the others, who have called me an idiot. If Timon had approached me first, I would have three times the amount he asks for. But now, servant, go back to him and tell him this: whoever scorns me this way will never get my money.
Wow, what a villain! Even the devil couldn't have known how evil men would be when he made them so crafty. He ruined himself in the process, and there's no way that all the badness in men will ever absolve him. It is incredible how this lord actually works to seem horrible! He makes himself seem virtuous, but only so he can be as wicked as those who would burn entire empires to the ground. That's what political desire is made of. He was Timon's best chance at getting money, and now all hopes are gone except for the will of the gods. Timon's friends are dead to him, and now all those doors he had left wide open all those years must be closed and used to protect him in his home. That's what being too generous gets you. He who cannot hang onto wealth must at least hang onto his house.
Right on time. Good day, Titus and Hortensius.
And you as well.
Oh, a representative of Lucius! Are you here to see Timon as well?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes. We do all have the same goal, and mine is money.
And your goal is our goal.
Not only Lucius's Servant, but Philotus's too!
Good day.
Hello. What time is it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Close to nine.
That late?
Has anyone seen Timon yet?
Not yet.
I wonder why. He usually wakes up at seven.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yeah, but the days have become shorter for him, because you should remember that the path of extravagance descends like the sun in winter, even if it does not regain its height the following year. And I'm afraid that Lord Timon's estate is withering, no matter how hard he tries to recover money.
Me too.
And I'll tell you something funny. [To HORTENSIUS] Your lord sent you to get money, right?
Yes.
And he now possesses jewels from Timon, which I lent him the money to buy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Unfortunately, yes.
It's so weird how Timon must pay out more than he owes, while your lord seems to get the privilege of wearing the jewels and getting to request the money paid for them.
God I'm sick of this job. I know that my lord spent Timon's money and now in his ingratitude is as bad as a thief.
Yeah. My lord is asking for three thousand crowns. What about yours?
Five thousand.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Way too much. It seems your master is more brazen even than mine, otherwise mine would have asked for as much.
One of Timon's servants is coming
Flaminius! Can we talk for a second? Is Timon coming?
No he's not.
At least tell him we are waiting for him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I don't have to do that. He knows how attentive you are.
Ha! Is that his assistant wrapped up like that? Get him, he's trying to sneak away under cover.
[Pestering FLAVIUS] Can we talk, please?
[Pestering FLAVIUS] Please, sir—
What do you want?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We want the money Timon owes.
Yes, if only money were as sure a thing as you all asking for it, then you would definitely have it. Why didn't your masters send you to pay the bills for the food they ate off Timon's plate? That way, they could smile and enjoy the debts he incurred and then shovel all the interest he owed into their greedy mouths. You're not doing yourself any favors riling me up like this. Let me go. My lord and I have parted ways. I have no more counsel to give, and he has no more money to spend.
Yes, but that still isn't enough.
If it's not enough, it's still worth more than all of you, because you serve bad men.
What did the fired man just say?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Whatever, he's poor and that's punishment enough for him. After all, who can say whatever he wants more than the man with no home and nothing to lose?
Here is Servilius. Now we'll know what is going on.
If I may ask, gentleman, please come back some other time, and it will help me a great deal. I swear, Timon is extremely upset. His cheerful disposition is gone, he is sick, and he keeps to his room.
Lots of people who stay in their rooms aren't sick, and if he's as sick as you say he is, all the more reason for him to pay off his debts before he dies.
Good lord!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We can't accept this.
[Shouting from inside] Servilius, help! Timon! Timon!
What, are my own doors going to shut themselves to me? Am I not free to leave my own house? Does the home to such great parties turn its back on me, like everyone else?
Calm down Titus.
Here is the receipt for debts you owe me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here's mine.
And mine.
And ours.
All our receipts.
Go ahead, kill me with them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But—
Rip pieces of my heart out.
My receipt is for fifty talents.
Count my blood drop by drop and take it from me.
Five thousand drops should cover.[To the other servants] What about all your receipts?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord—
My lord—
Tear me apart and take me away, and may the gods take their revenge upon you!
It seems our masters should probably give up on getting their money back. Now that Timon's mad, these debts are junk.
[Panting] These men have even taken my breath away. They call themselves creditors? They are devils!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Timon—
[Coming up with an idea] But what if...
Timon—
[Realizing something] Yes, that's it! Come here!
I'm here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So soon? Go get all those men for me. Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius, all of them! I'll throw them one last party!
But my lord you only speak in a daze. You do not have enough money yet to offer even a small meal.
Don't worry about that. Go, and invite them all. Let in that wave of villains once more. My cook and I will figure it out.
You have my vote! He should die for this heinous act, because mercy would only lead to more behavior like it.
I agree. He must face the rule of law.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Long live the senate!
What, captain?
I stand before you virtuous men to ask a favor. The law is a merciful thing, which only a tyrant could use for cruel purposes. Time and hard luck have worked against a friend of mine who recently broke the law in a fit of rage, a state which unfortunately the law does not consider when men break it. My friend, this action aside, is a good man, who in the moment actually acted without cowardice—something which ought to be held against his crime—by bravely identifying and responding to one who had ruined his reputation. He opposed this enemy with a clearheaded and calculating passion, expressing his anger with a certain coldness, almost as if he were proving a point.
Your argument is contradictory, a forced attempt to make gross actions seem justifiable. Your rhetoric reaches almost to the point of labor as it tries to turn murder into a mere formality and feuding into an act of valor. Feuds actually prove to be valor in its most degenerate form, as they come from the formation of rivalries. A man is truly valiant only when he can endure the worst insults men can speak, and even wear them like clothing without a care in the world. True valor never takes injury to heart, or retaliates in violence. If acts of injustice are in fact evil and force us to kill others, how dumb it would be then to risk your life for such a cause!
But—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You cannot make terrible sins look innocent. Valor is patience, not revenge.
Then forgive me for speaking like a military man, my lords. Why do good people fight and not patiently bear the insults of their enemies? Why do they not patiently let those same enemies murder them in their sleep? If there is such honor in patience, what do we make of our wars abroad, and why are women not considered more valiant for staying at home? Why do we not deem the donkey superior to the lion, or the prisoner to the judge, if there is such wisdom in suffering? You are great men, be compassionate. Who would not sentence a man for violent aggression? You are right, murder is the greatest sin, but when it is done for self-defense it is fair. Anger is wicked, but who has not been angry before? Think about this as you judge the crime before you.
Your speech is useless.
Useless! The man's heroism at the battles of Lacedaemon and Byzantium should be enough to win him his life.
What?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The man is a hero and has killed many of our enemies. How bravely did he fight and wound many men in the last battle?
He wounded too many men. He's a crazy drunk, and that vice ruins his honor. He would fight even if he had no enemies, and in his temper he has committed many crimes and encourages rebellion. We have been told that he is a dangerous and wicked man.
He will die.
How cruel! He would have died in battle if he did not have certain good qualities. And even though his sword-arm has bought him a longer life, in which he owes nothing to anyone, take this as encouragement to change your ruling. Think of what's mine as his, and because I know you all love money, I'll give to you all that I have won at war in return for his safety. If he owes his life for this crime, let it at least be had at war with the army. War can punish the way the law does.
We represent the law. He will die, and stop pushing the point. Though it does not please us, he will die for murder, even if he is your friend or family.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why does it have to be this way? It cannot be. Please, my lords, I beg you to trust me.
How!
Remember what I have done.
What?
You cannot possibly have forgotten me, but there is no other reason you would deny me after I have lowered myself to beg for something you would grant any other man. It hurts me to the very core.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Are you seriously provoking us? In just a few words we can have an enormous impact. We banish you forever.
Banish me! Banish your old ways! Banish your money-lending! Banish everything that has ruined the senate!
If we find you in Athens two days from now, you will face the most severe punishment. And even though it displeases us, your friend will be executed now.
The gods have let you live so long that you are only skin and bones, and so ugly that no one will even look at you! I'm crazy with anger. I have defended them from their enemies. They have lent their money to everyone and pocketed the earnings, while all I have are wounds from battle. All that fighting for this? Is this what the senate gives its captains for sacrificing themselves to battle? Banishment! Good! I would hate not to be banished. It makes me angry enough to attack Athens. I'll gather the troops and garner their support. Countries are always at war, and soldiers should not have to face any more trials than the gods.
Good day, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You too. This feels familiar.
I was just thinking that when we met. I hope things are not so bad that Timon has had to borrow more from his friends.
From what I see at this feast, I don't think so.
I do. He sent me an invitation, and when I said I had other engagements, he pressed me further and told me I had to come.
I also said I needed to deal with some business matters, but he didn't care. I am not happy to say it, but when he asked me for money, I had no more left to give him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Same with me. I know how it is.
So does everyone here. How much money did he ask you for?
A thousand pieces.
A thousand pieces!
What did he ask you for?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He asked me for—here he is.
Greetings, gentleman. How are you?
Well, especially after seeing that you are well, too.
We care as much about you as a bird that flies south cares for summer weather.
[To himself] And you and other men have left me with the readiness that the bird flees from winter weather.[To the others] Dinner is getting cold, gentlemen! Enjoy the music, if you like such humble playing. Let's go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I hope you are not bitter that I could not lend you money.
Don't worry about it.
My noble lord—
[As the banquet is being prepared] What a party!
Timon, I feel so bad that I had no money left to give you when you asked me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Don't worry about it.
If you had come just two hours earlier—
Think about happier things.
Come here, the food is ready!
It must be good food if you cover it this way!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It looks like food for kings.
As long as he has enough money and time, I would count on it from Timon.
[To the THIRD LORD] Oh how are you? What is new with the world?
Did you hear that Alcibiades is banished?
What? Alcibiades is banished?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I swear.
What? How?
Why?
Come here, my friends.
I'll tell you about it later. Let's eat now.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You speak of the famous Alcibiades?
Can it be? Will the punishment stick?
Yes, but time will tell—
I see.
Go to your chairs as hungrily as you might kiss the lips of your mistress. There are no assigned seats, when the food gets cold before people find out where they sit. Sit, sit, and thank the gods. I thank you for the gifts you have given, and hope you will keep enough for yourselves so that you can still be so charitable in the future. You should have given enough that no man will have to give his own money to another, because even gods would not be successful in applying for a loan nowadays. Enjoy the meat more than you enjoy the man who provides you with it. Make sure also that twenty out of twenty men are villains, as you might let twelve women at a table be as they are. As for the rest, the senators and the commoners, destroy the worst parts of them.[Gesturing to the people around him]  My friends here, they mean nothing to me, so bless them with nothing. Here they are welcome to nothing. Uncover the dishes so the dogs may lick up the water.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is this supposed to mean?
I don't know.
All you bottom-feeders, water and steam is the perfect meal for you, and I hope you never eat a better feast than this for the rest of your lives. I, who endured all your flattery, wash myself of it and return to you your wickedness.
I hope you live long and painful lives, you smooth-talking parasites, you wolves in sheeps' clothing, you weak fools of fortune, fake friends, worthless workers! You'll die soon enough! May the worst disease cover you all over in scabs! What, are you leaving? Come now, everyone, take your medicine first! Come on, I'll give you money and ask for nothing back!
What, everyone's leaving? From now on, let there never be a feast where such villains are not welcome. Burn down the house! Destroy all of Athens! Timon will from now on hate all of humanity!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What the hell was that?
Have you ever seen someone as furious as Timon just now?
Psh! Have you seen my hat?
I can't find my coat.
He's a madman, and his insanity is what drives him. He gave me a jewel the other day, and now he has beaten it out of my hat. Have you seen the jewel?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have you seen my hat?
Here it is.
And here's my coat.
Let's get out of here.
Timon is crazy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes I am sure of it.
One day he gives us diamonds, and the next day he throws stones at us!
Let me back on the city. Your walls that contain those ravenous wolves should sink into the earth instead of protecting you, Athens. I hope your mothers become drunks and that your children grow bad-tempered! I hope that slaves and idiots replace the cranky old senators and rule from their seats, that little girls turn instantly into low whores and lose their virginities right in front of their parents' eyes, that bankrupt debtors pay back their debts by slitting their creditors' throats, and that servants bound to loyalty steal from their masters! The great men of Athens are all greedy robbers and use the law to plunder for their own means. You, maid, go to your masters' bed, because your mistress is a whore! You, sixteen-year-old son, steal the cane out of the hands of your old crippled father and use it to beat out his brains! All civic virtues—piety, fear, devotion, peace, justice, truth, respect, tranquility, neighborly love, education, manners, professions, ranks, observance, custom, law—let all your chaotic opposites reign in destruction! You, plague, attack Athens with your powerful and infectious fevers! You, sciata, cripple all the senators and make their limbs as useless as their manners! You, free lust, crawl into the minds and bodies of teenagers so that they betray virtue and drown themselves in debauchery! I hope every Athenian is infected with horrible itches and boils, and be struck with leprosy. May each breath spread infection and make society poisonous! Evil city, I will spare you no evil but the sight of my naked body—but no, take that too![Ripping off his clothes and flashing the city walls] I, Timon, will go to the woods and find the most savage beast a better friend to mankind. May the gods drive all Athenians within and outside the city walls crazy! And may I grow to hate more and more the whole race of mankind, top to bottom! Amen.
Listen, where is our master? Are we done for? Fired? Is there nothing left?
Guys, what do you want me to say? The gods hear me when I say that I am as broke as you are.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How great a house gone bankrupt! How great a master fallen! Everything's gone! And there's not a single friend to help him in this unfortunate time and accompany him!
As we leave our friend, tossed into his grave, so too do those friends whose fortunes were tied to his now run away, leaving with him only their lies, like purses emptied by a pick-pocket. And the poor man will become a homeless beggar with his disease of poverty, walking alone in contempt. Look, here are more of our friends.
All the shattered pieces of a ruined house.
I can see in our sullen faces that all our hearts still wear the uniforms we served Timon in. We are still friends, serving him in sorrow. It is as if our boat had a leak and we were standing on the sinking deck, hearing the water rising all around us. We must all leave each other to drown in this imaginary sea.
Friends, I'll share with you the last bit of money I have. Wherever we next meet, let's still be friends for Timon's sake. Let's shake our heads and say, "We have seen better days," to honor our old master's fortune.[He puts out his hands] Let's each take a bit of what's left. Put out your hands, and without saying one more word, let's all part poor in money, but rich in sadness.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, the terrible sadness that glory can bring! Who wouldn't wish to never be rich, if all that riches lead to is misery and hate? Who would ever accept fame or friendship, if all of the luxury and everything else that comes with it is fake, like those friends of Timon's? Poor man, doing himself in by his own goodness! It's a strange curse when a man's worst sin is that he does too much good! Who will ever dare to be half as kind again? The wealth that makes the gods ruins men. My good lord, blessed only to later be cursed, rich only to later be poor, your great fortune was built upon your greatest weaknesses. Oh what a kind man! He's cast out mad from this group of monsters, with nothing to live on at all and no way to make more money. I'll follow and ask about him. I'll always serve him as well as I can. As long as I have any wealth, I'll be by his side.
Oh generous sun, suck all of this rotten dampness from the ground into the air below the moon! In the case of twin brothers, who were identically conceived, housed, and born out of the same womb into a world with different fortunes, it is the one with more who scorns the one with less. Human nature is subject to many evils, and cannot bear great riches without reserving contempt for those without such luxuries. I will become a beggar and restrain the lord within me, for the senator will be scorned, the beggar honored. Whether or not one is wealthy is only a matter of luck: if an ox is born into abundant pastures, he will grow fat, whereas if he is born into scarcity, he will grow thin. Who? Who will dare to stand up for what's right and call a man a flatterer? After all, if one man is a flatterer, so is everyone, because every level in a hierarchy is flattered by the one below it. Smart men bow to rich fools. Everything is ridiculous, because we have nothing rational within our nature, just straight villainy. Thus I hate all feasts, society, and groups of people! Timon hates anything that resembles—or is—himself. All men go to hell! Earth, where are your roots?
Whoever works to rise in the world ought to poison himself! What do we have here? Gold? Shiny yellow gold? No, I am not a false man—[He keeps digging] Where are you, roots?![Looking at the gold] Just this much gold will turn the world upside down, making black white, foul fair, wrong right, low high, old young, cowardice valor. Ha, gods! Why this little thing? What is it, even? Why does this steal from you your loyal priests and servants, and steal the pillow from beneath a man's head? This yellow fiend will make and break religions, bless the lowly, and even make the leper liked, the thief as great as a senator! This little thing makes a widow get married a second time, and rejuvenates a woman so ugly that even the grossest men plagued with sores would have rejected her.[Still digging] Come on, stupid earth, whoring around beneath the feet of different nations, I will lower myself to your level and take my revenge.
What, a drum? So soon? [Talking to some of the gold] I'll bury you: you will walk about again when your keeper cannot stand because of his gout. Actually, no, stay out here for leverage.
What are you doing there? Speak up.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An animal, the same as you! Damn you for showing me again the eyes of a human!
What is your name? Has mankind been so awful to you? You are a man, after all.
I am a man-hater, who hates mankind. I wish you were a dog, for your good as well as mine. Then I could love you at least a little.
I understand what you are saying, but do not know how you have arrived at these conclusions.
I know you as well, more than I'd like to know. Go follow your drum and paint the ground with the red, red, red blood of men. Religious and civil laws are cruel—why shouldn't war be cruel too?[Speaking of PHRYNIA] This whore of yours right here has more power to destroy than your sword, despite her angelic appearance.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Shut your filthy mouth!
Then I will not kiss you, so as not to dirty your mouth too.
How has the noble Timon fallen to this place?
Like the moon, which falls as it loses its light to give. But I cannot renew myself and start again like the moon. There are no suns out there to borrow light from.
Timon, what can I do for you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nothing, except follow my demands.
What is it you want, Timon?
Promise me your friendship, but don't do anything that would make you seem like my friend. That way, whether you refuse or keep this promise, and whether you follow through or not, the gods may damn you, because you are like all these other men!
I have heard a bit about your bad luck.
You saw my bad luck even when I had my wealth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, I see your bad luck now. Those were great times when you had your wealth.
[Referring to TIMANDRA and PHRYNIA] Like your good times now with these whores.
Is this the darling of Athens everyone spoke so well of?
You are Timandra?
Yes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Keep whoring around. Those who use you don't love you, so you might as well give them diseases, because they give you their lust. Use these dirty hours well and prepare these villains for tubs and baths. Bring those bright youths down to their rightful place, trying to cure their venereal diseases with diets and salt-baths.
Go kill yourself you monster!
Forgive him, Timandra. His mind has been muddled and lost in his troubles.[To TIMON] I have only a little money left, Timon, and the lack of it makes the possibility of revolt greater and greater each day in my poor band of soldiers. I have heard and felt sorry for how Athens left you high and dry, completely forgetting you and your great deeds when neighboring states would have defeated the city had you not protected it with your sword and your wealth.
Please, play yourself out.
I'm your friend Timon. I feel for you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do you feel for the person whom you hurt? I'd rather be alone.
Well goodbye. Here is some gold.
Keep it. It won't feed me.
When I destroy Athens in war—
You're waging war on Athens?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, Timon, and for a good reason.
May the gods strike those you war against, and after you win, you as well!
Why me too, Timon?
Because you were born to conquer my country by killing villains. Keep your gold and go, take it. Be like a plague that ravages the entire world, or like Zeus throwing poison over some wicked city. Do not spare any with your sword, and give no mercy to the elderly man, as he is a money-lender. Give no mercy to false women, because they only look honest and are all whores. Give no mercy to young virgins, because those breasts that break through the lines of her bodies and into men's eyes are horrible traitors and do not deserve pity. Do not spare any babies, whose smiling only earns the mercy of fools. Think of them as bastards, whom an oracle has foreseen will cut your throat, and crush it without any guilt. Swear not to listen to any objections, and arm your ears and your eyes so they shall not yield to the yells of mothers, maids, or babies, or the sight of priests bleeding in their holy clothes. Here's some gold to pay your soldiers. Make a riot, and after all your rage is gone, damn you! Don't speak to me. Just go.
You still have gold? I'll take that, but not your advice.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do or don't, damn you.
Give us some gold, too, Timon. Do you have any more?
Enough to get a whore to retire, as well as enough to turn women into whores too. Stop bothering me and holding your skirts up, you sluts. You are not trustworthy, though I do know you will swear shaking with supposed divinity onto the immortal gods. Spare your prayers, and I'll trust your characters. Keep whoring, and the man that tries to tell you to do otherwise, be sure to stay true to your profession, seduce him, and infect him with your venereal diseases. Let that hidden fire overpower his piety, and do not betray your craft so that you may keep laboring. Cover your heads with wigs plucked from the hairs of the dead—even if they were hanged. Wear them and sin with them. Keep whoring around, with that thick makeup hiding all your wrinkles!
Tell us more with more gold. We'll do anything for gold!
Plant syphilis into the hollow bones of men. Kick their shins and cripple them. Steal the voice of the lawyer, so he will never ever defend a false case or voice his small disagreements. Give diseases to the priest who scolds against carnal pleasures, but doesn't behave himself. Make it so his nose rots off, so that for his private pleasures he loses the scent of public welfare. Make curly-haired scoundrels bald, and have the silly macho men in the army finally feel some pain from you. Give diseases to everyone, so that in your profession you defeat all of men's power. Here's some more gold, so that you damn even more. But let it damn you, too, and send you to your graves!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We'll keep listening to you if you keep giving us money, Timon.
With more whoring, and more mischief first. This payment is just a token.
Drum up the march to Athens! Bye, Timon. If I am successful, I'll come back for you.
And I hope I never see you again.
I never did you any harm.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, you spoke well of me.
And that's harm?
Some men think so. Go now and take your dogs with you.
We're just making him more angry. Let's go!
I cannot believe that those outraged at wicked men should still ask for money!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You, earth, your fertile ground births and feeds everything. You are made of the same hard stuff that puffs out the chests of proud men, though is also the same stuff that produces disgusting critters like the black toad, the blue snake, the golden newt, and the blind, poisonous worm. The sun shines its life-giving fire equally on all of these horrid births. Earth, give me just one poor root, which all men hate! Dry up your fertile womb so that it never gives life to another man! Bring forth tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears. Produce new monsters, never before presented to the world from your face which looks up into the heavens![He finds a root] Finally! A root! Dry up your marrow, vines, and grassy lands, which yield the sweet drinks and tasty food that grease the sides of ungrateful mens' minds, so that all that was considerate within them slips out!
Another man? The plague, the plague!
I was directed here by men who tell me you have gone crazy and insult them.
It is true, and because you do not have a dog which I could imitate so as to flatter you, I hope you catch a disease!
This behavior is a symptom of your infected nature, which has caught an unmanly melancholy due to bad luck. Why this shovel? In this place? In these tattered clothes? With these sad looks? Those who flattered you still wear silk, drink wine, and lie down on soft beds. They hug their perfumed, diseased women, and have totally forgotten that Timon even existed. Do not curse these woods by becoming a cynic. Be a flatterer and look to live off what once undid you. Bow your knee and heed every word of the men you would flatter as genius. Praise the worst parts of a man and call them excellent. That is what you used to be told. You once gave your ears to men like bartenders give their ears to the worst villains and rascals. It is only fair that you become a rascal. If you had your money again, rascals would have it. Do not act as I did to you, act like them!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I were like you I'd throw myself away.
You already have thrown yourself away, being the madman you were, and now an idiot. Do you really think that this cold air will act like a manservant and put on a warm shirt for you? Do you really think that these mossy trees, which have outlived eagles, will follow your every step? That the cold brook crusted in ice will give you a warm drink to cure a hangover? Call out to the animals who live naked despite the fall of man, who expose their bodies to the harsh elements and contend with nature. Call them to flatter you and, oh, you will find—
You're an idiot. Go away.
I love you more than I ever did.
I hate you worse.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why?
You flatter my misery.
I am not flattering you. I am calling you a wretch.
Why did you look for me?
To anger you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That was always the job of a villain or a fool. Do you like it?
Sure.
Ah! So you're scoundrel too!
If you assumed this disposition to punish yourself for our pride, that was a good idea. But you are forcing it! If you weren't a beggar, you could be a courtier again. Willful poverty is safer than uncertain luxury, and achieves what it wants sooner. One is always seeking more and never fulfilled. The other will accept no better situation, but has a crazy and miserable existence and is happy with the worst of the worst. You should kill yourself, as miserable as you are.
Not under the advice of a man even more miserable. You are a slave, a dog, who was always unlucky. If you were born like I was into a sweet life this world gives to whoever it likes, you would have gone crazy and wasted your youth in lusty beds. You would never have learned hard reason, but instead followed all temptations before you. But I, who was born right in the place where all sweet things are made, and where countless mouths, tongues, eyes, and hearts of men waited at my command, stuck to me like leaves stick to an oak, I was abandoned by all them, as if those leaves had all dropped at the first sight of winter and left me bare to feel every storm. Trust me, you who never knew any better, bearing this tragedy is a great burden. Your life began in suffering, and you have grown used to it. Why should you hate men? They never flattered you? What did you give them? If you will curse anyone it should be your father, because he had sex with some poor woman out of spite and conceived you. So just go away! If you had not been born in the worst position, you would have been a false flatterer.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha! You are still proud?
Yes, proud of the fact that I'm not you.
And I'm proud of the fact that I was never a wasteful man like you.
Yes and I'm still proud that I am a wasteful man still. I would still give all the wealth I have—nothing—to you. Get away from me.[Gesturing to a root] I wish all of Athens were in this! I would eat it!
Here, improve your feast.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* First improve my company and get away from me.
That way I would improve my own company for the lack of yours.
It would not be better that way, because you'd still be with yourself.
What report would you like me to bring Athens for you?
A tornado, if you could, and tell them that I have more gold here. Look, right here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Gold is useless here.
And so it is here the best, where it sleeps and doesn't do any harm.
Where do you sleep here Timon?
Under what's above me. Where do you eat these days, Apemantus?
Wherever I can find meat, or rather, where I eat meat.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I wish poison would go wherever my mind sent it!
Where would you send it?
To your plates.
You never inhabited the middle ranks of humanity, only the very rich and the very poor. When you were basking in gold in perfume, they all mocked you for your meticulousness. In your tattered rags you don't have any of that left, but are despised for being messy and dirty. Here's a little fruit for you, eat it.
I don't eat what I hate.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You hate medlar?
Yes. It looks rotten like you.
If you had hated meddlers sooner, you would have loved your station better now. What wasteful man did you ever meet that was well-liked after his money was gone?
Who have you ever known that was well-liked without any means at all?
Me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* True. The dogs love you because you only have enough means to keep a dog.
What would you compare your flatterers to?
Women, probably. But men too, because they are men themselves. What would you do with the world if you were all-powerful, Apemantus?
Give it to the animals and get rid of all men.
Would you fall with the rest of the men and remain an animal?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, Timon.
What a beastly thing for the gods to have you wish! If you were a lion, the fox would trick you; if you were a lamb, the fox would deceive three of you; if you were a fox, the lion would be suspicious of you when you were accused by the donkey; if you were a donkey, your stupidity would torment you, and you would only be the breakfast of the wolf; if you were a wolf, your greed would plague you, and you would have to risk your life just for dinner; if you were a unicorn, pride and anger would end you and when in your anger you rammed your horn and got stuck in a tree; if you were a bear, you would be killed by the horse; if you were a horse; you would be attacked by the leopard; if you were a leopard, you would be related to the lion and the crimes of your relatives would condemn you to death. Your only safety would lie in leaving one place for another, so what beast could you be that you would not fall prey to some other beast? What kind of animal are you already that you cannot see what you would lose in changing into an animal!?
If your speech could ever please me, it would be these observations. The state of Athens has become a forest of beasts.
How? Has a donkey broken down the wall, so you find yourself outside the city?
Look, here comes a poet and a painter. I hope you catch the plague of their company! For fear of catching it I'll leave now. I'll see you again when I have nothing better to do.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* When you're the last man on earth, you'll be welcome here. I would rather be a beggar's dog than you.
You are the captain of all fools.
I wish you were clean enough to spit on.
Get bit! You aren't even good enough to curse.
Villains look good in your company.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your speech is worse than leprosy.
When I say your name. I'll beat you up, if only touching you wouldn't infect my hands!
I wish my tongue could rot them off!
Get away, you son of a bitch! Your life makes me angry enough to die. I swoon just looking at you!
Maybe you'll explode!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Get away you dumb peasant! It's sad I have to waste a stone on you.
Beast!
Slave!
Toad!
You worthless, worthless man! I am sick of this lying world and will not love anything but the most basic necessities. So, Timon, prepare your own grave, lie down here where the light foam of the sea might lap against your grave stone every single day. Make your own epitaph, so my death will laugh at the lives of others.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh you sweet little king-killer, which can set even a son and father at odds! You that can defile the bed of Hymen like Mars! You forever young, fresh, beloved, and delicate wooer, that can ruin the chastity of Diana with just a blush! You beautiful god, which can sew together impossible events and make them kiss! That can speak in every language and for any purpose! You tester of hearts, that think your slave man rebels against you and, with your power, set him at odds with himself so that beasts may rule the world!
If only it were so! But not until I am dead. I'll say to gold that it will be rushed to before long.
Rushed to!?
Yes.
Show me your back and leave.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* May you live in misery and love it too.
May you live long and miserable too, then die.
I am rid of him, and yet more men! Hate them, Timon, and eat your food.
Where could his gold be? It is the last scrap of his life of wealth. It was the mere desire for gold and the betrayal of his friends which drove him to this depression.
I have heard he has a huge treasure.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let's test that. If he doesn't care about it, he'll give it to us without a care. If he covets it, how will we get it?
That's a good question, because he doesn't have it with him. It's hidden.
Is that not him?
Where?
That's what he's supposed to look like.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Him? I recognize him.
God bless you, Timon?
What do you want, thieves?
We're soldiers, not thieves.
Both, and women's sons too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We are not thieves, just poor men.
The greatest thing you lack is brought about by your great desire to eat a lot—why else would you feel poor? Look here, the earth has roots, and within a mile are a hundred springs. The oaks have nuts, the briers red berries. Nature is a generous housewife, who gives a great meal on each bush. Poor! How could you feel poor?
We are not animals, birds, nor fish. We cannot live on just grass, berries, and water.
No you cannot even live on animals like birds and fish yourselves. You must eat men. Though I ought to thank you for at least being honest thieves who do not hide behind some more respectable disguise, for there is thievery in other professions as well. Here's some gold, you dirty thieves. Go now and drink all the wine you can until you catch a deadly fever that makes your blood foam. Do not trust the doctor, though, because his cures are poisonous and he kills men even more often than you rob them, taking both money and lives. Wreak havoc as your occupation dictates,  and like one being instructed in his occupation, I'll give you good examples of thieves. The sun is a thief for robbing water from the vast sea; the moon is a thief for snatching light off the sun; the sea is a thief as its tides surge forth, dissolve the moon into salty tears; the earth is a thief as it steals and feeds off the manure of animals. Everything is a thief, from the laws to its enforcement, which use their unlimited power to steal. And do not make yourselves the exception, go away and rob one another. Here's some more gold. Go cut some throats, because everyone you meet is a thief. Go to Athens, pillage shops, because nothing you steal will not come from a thief's pocket. Do not steal any less because I'm giving you this, more gold, which I hope may curse you! Amen.
He almost makes me want to give up my profession by talking me into it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* His hatred of mankind is what gives us advice, not his concern for our craft.
I'd trust him about as much as my enemy and just give up thieving altogether.
Let's at least wait until the war is over. There is no worse time to be honest than a war.
Good god! Is that hateful man in tatters, looking so down and out, really my lord? Oh he is a memorial of what happens when good deeds are received ungratefully! Poverty has made such a remarkable change to his honorable appearance! How vile his friends were to bring down such a great man! It really shows the accuracy of that saying, "Love your enemies!" I would indeed much rather love those who wish me harm to my face than those who pretend to be my friends and stab me in the back.[Noticing TIMON] He has seen me, and I will show him how much I grieve for him, and how I promise still to serve him. My fine master!
Go away! Who are you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have you forgotten who I am?
Why bother asking that? I have forgotten all men. If you agree that you are indeed a man, then I have forgotten you too.
I was your poor and loyal servant.
Then I definitely do not know you, because I never had an honest man around me. All those I kept around me were liars, because I wanted to serve meat to villains.
The gods know that there has never been an assistant racked with sadness for his lord the way I am looking at you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, are you crying? Come closer. I do love you, now, because these tears show you to be a woman. You give up your manhood, because no man's eyes ever did tear up, except for lust or laughter. Pity may as well be asleep, for these are strange times, in which people weep for laughter and not in sadness.
I beg you, please recognize me, my good lord. That way you can accept my sadness and let me serve as your assistant while this bad luck continues.
Did I really have an assistant so honest, fair, and comforting? It almost cures me of my dangerous and violent thoughts. Let me see your face: you are definitely a man born of a woman. Forgive me gods, for assuming the worst of all men. I admit now that there is one honest man, only one. No more, I swear—and he's just an assistant. How I dared to hate all of mankind![To FLAVIUS] You do redeem yourself, but the rest I did lay flat with insults. I think you are more honest than wise, because you might have been better off betraying me. Many do have second masters at the expense of their first. But tell me, please, is your kindness not a subtle, greedy, and self-serving kind of kindness, which hopes to get what it gives twenty-to-one?
No, master, in whom doubt and suspicion have taken hold too late. You should have feared lies when you threw feasts with your wealth, but your suspicion comes when you are most poor. What I show you is true love, duty, and enthusiasm for your outstanding mind, along with care for your wellbeing. Believe me, my lord, that any advantage I could gain now I would exchange for one wish: that you had the power and wealth to make yourself rich. That would be the return for my admiration.
Look here, it is true! You uniquely honest man, take this. The gods have given you a gift out of my misery. [Offering FLAVIUS gold] Go be rich and happy, but under one condition: you take advantage of other men, hate all of them, curse all of them, and show charity to none of them. Let the starving flesh slide off the bones of a beggar before you give him any money. Give to dogs what you do not give to men, whom you should let go to prison in debt. Let men be like dying woods, with diseases eating at their lying blood. Live this way, and goodbye.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let me stay and comfort you, master.
If you hate to be insulted, do not stay. Go away, and while you are blessed and free, never meet with another man, and never let me see you here again.
As I recall, he can't be far from here.
What do you think? Do you think it's true that he's got a hidden stash of gold?
Definitely. Alcibiades says so, and Phrynia and Timandra got gold from him. He also gave the poor soldiers a ton. I also heard he gave his assistant a lot too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So his bankruptcy has just been a test for his friends.
It can't be anything else. You'll see him high and mighty in Athens again, to be sure. For that reason it's not crazy to appeal to him in his supposed distress. It'll look good for us, and it is likely to end in us receiving what the others got, if it is in fact true that he has money.
What do you have to give to him?
Nothing but my presence for now. I will promise him an excellent work of art.
Me too, and to promise him something in the future.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good idea. Promises are all the rage right now. They open the door for expectation, whereas actions themselves are merely done once they happen. With the exception of the plainer and simpler sort, the fulfillment of promises has gone out of fashion. But still promising itself is current and stylish. The actual doing of the thing is a kind of statement that shows a lack of judgment in the person who made the promise in the first place.
[To himself] What an artist! You couldn't paint a man worse than yourself.
I am thinking about what I will say I have brought him. It must be some kind of portrait of himself, maybe a satire about the flightiness of wealth, with an exposition about the many flatteries that youth and opulence brings with it.
[To himself] Do you really need to model a villain in your work? Would you chastise your own vices in other men? Do it, and I've got gold for you.
Let's go look for him. We would do wrong to our own prosperity if we were to arrive to late to such an opportunity.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* For sure. Before night falls, we ought to find what is offered freely in the light of day. Follow me.
[To himself] I'll play your own little game. What a magnificent god is gold, that it is worshipped in a place grosser than a pigpen. It is the thing that rigs the ship and sets it on its journey, the thing that makes a slave honor his master. May people continue to worship it! May its disciples forever be chased with its own unique plagues. It's about time to talk to them.
Hey, Timon!
Our great master!
Have I ever seen two such honest men?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, after having received so many of your gifts, and then hearing you were retired, abandoned by friends so ungrateful that all the whips of heaven are not large enough to punish them. Incredible! To you, whose stellar generosity gave life to them! It drives me mad, and I cannot conceive of any way to describe this level of ingratitude.
Let it go. Some men might be more optimistic. Your truthfulness, your being what you proclaim to be, make ungrateful men more noticeable.
He and I have triumphed in the great shower of your gifts and enjoyed it so much!
Yes, you are honest men.
We have come to offer you our service.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Such honest men! How could I ever repay you? Can you eat roots or drink cold water? No.
We'll do what we can for you.
You are both honest men and have heard that I have gold. I am sure that you have. Tell me the truth, honest men.
We have heard that. But that is not why we've come.
Good honest men! You draw the best portrait in all of Athens. Yes, you are the best, your counterfeits are the most lifelike.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So it is, my lord.
Yes, it is as I said.[To the POET] And as for your fiction, the lines swell with material so fine and smooth that your art comes to equal nature. But in spite of all this, my truthful friends, I must say that you do have one vice. It's not such a bad thing, and you shouldn't try too hard to fix it.
Please, Timon, tell us what it is.
You won't like it.
We'll appreciate it, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you really?
Definitely.
Both of you are too trustful of scoundrels who wish to deceive you.
Are we really?
Definitely. You hear him cheat, see him pretend, and watch him commit crimes, and all the while you love him, feed him, and keep him close, knowing full well that he's a total villain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know no one like this.
Me neither.
Hey, guys, I like you a lot. I'll give you some gold, and in return you may rid the world of some evil men. Hang them, stab them, drown them in a toilet, I don't care. Get rid of them some way, and then come to me and I'll give you even more gold.
Name your enemies, Timon, we'd like to know.
You, that man, and you the other, each of you still in the company of the other. Each of you is single and alone when apart from the other, but now an enemy keeps you company.[To one of the men] If you promise to rid the world of villains, do not go near the other guy.[To the other] If you swear you will not stand where one villain is, abandon him.[To both] So go away! Here's the gold you came for, you slaves.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here's payment for the work you owe me. Now go!
You make gold from metal. Here, make gold from this! Get out of here you dogs!
It's useless to speak with Timon. He only trusts himself, and nobody that looks anything like a man appears friendly to him.
Bring us to the cave. We promised the Athenians we would speak to Timon.
Men are not the same all the time. It was time and sadness that made him this way. Time presents to him the riches of his former days, the opportunity to become the man he was. Bring us to to him and we'll take our chances.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here is his cave. We come in peace and friendship! Timon! Timon! Come out and speak to two friends. The Athenians send their best to you in two honored senators. Speak to them, Timon.
You, sun which comforts the world, burn them! Speak to me and then be hanged! Because each true word must to you be like a blister, and each lie burn you to the root of your tongue, eating it away with your own talk!
Great Timon—
Great to no one but those like yourself, and you but to Timon.
The Senators of Athens send their regards.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I thank them, and would send them a disease if only I could catch it for them.
Forget the things that have happened to you, which we are very sorry for. The senators unanimously agreed to ask you to come back to Athens. There are many honors there, totally ready for you to take up.
They admit they had were too quick to forget your good deeds, which they take back now that you have stopped aiding them, knowing full well that it is their fault for not extending their hands to you in your time of need. They sent us to tell you about our sadness, along with a repayment greater than their crime could possibly weigh on you. Indeed they promise such heaps of wealth and friendship that it should make you entirely forget how they wronged you, feeling within yourself instead such sentiments of love that you will always consider them your friends.
You cast a spell on me. You've beaten me to the brink of tears, giving me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes, crying before these comforting words.
So come back with us to Athens, a city yours as well as ours, to become a captain. You will be met with thanks and allowed absolute power and authority to your name. Soon enough we will drive back Alcibiades and his wild attacks. He is like a savage boar, rooting up the peace in his own country.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He threatens the walls of Athens with his own sword.
So Timon—
I will say this. If Alcibiades wants to kill my fellow citizens, let Alcibiades know that Timon does not care. But if he wants to pillage Athens, grabbing old men by the beards and sacrificing holy virgins to the horrors of war, then let him know that even as I pity the old and the young, I cannot help but say still that I do not care if he does his worst. Their blades do not care that your throats suffer the consequences of their actions. And as for me, I put the smallest switchblade in their rebel barracks before the most honored throat in all of Athens. I leave you to the protection of the gods, the way I might leave thieves to their jailers.
Let's go. It's hopeless.
I was writing the epitaph for my tombstone, which will be seen tomorrow. My blight of health and and living well is now being cured, and death will bring everything with it. Go and keep living. Let Alcibiades be your blight, and you his. Live that way as long as you can!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It's useless.
I do love my country, and contrary to what rumors may say, am not glad to see total destruction.
Well said.
Give my best to my fellow Athenians—
These words do the person who speaks them justice.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And enter our ears like trumpeters celebrating at the gates.
Give them my best, and tell them that, to ease their sadness, their fear of war, their pains, their losses, their pangs of love, and all the other difficulties common to life, I send some kindness their way. I'll teach them how to defend themselves against the wild Alcibiades's wrath.
This sounds good. He will return soon enough.
I have a tree that grows around here that I need to cut down, and I need to do that soon. Tell my friends in Athens of all stations that whoever wants to stop these pains should hurry here before my my axe touches the tree, so that they might hang themselves. Please, send those regards.
Stop bothering him. You will find him this way again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Don't come back, and instead tell all of Athens that Timon has built his house on the shore, and everyday will cover himself with the surging foam of the sea. Tell them to come here and let my grave-stone be their guide. Oh lips, let these harsh words fall from you and be your last, let everything wrong with the world be healed by ravaging diseases! Graves are just another of men's works, and death another of their benefits! Go away, sun! Timon has finished his time on earth.
His sadness is now a part of himself.
He's hopeless. Let's go back and try whatever else we can do to save ourselves.
We need to hurry.
You have retrieved information at great cost. Does he have as many troops as you say?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My estimate is conservative. Plus, he approaches at a great speed.
We are in great danger if the others do not bring Timon with them.
I met with a messenger friend of mine who, despite having argued with me in public, held a strong love for me and approached me like the old friend he is. He was riding from Alcibiades to Timon with letters hoping he would join the cause against Athens, which was inspired partly by his poor treatment here.
Here come our fellow Senators.
Let's not talk about Timon. We can't expect any help from him. The drum of the enemy armies can be heard in the city, and their marching lifts dust into the air. We fall right into the enemies' trap.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This looks like the place as it was described to me. Who's there? Speak up! No Answer! What is going on? Timon has reached his final days. He is dead. Some horrible animal must have done this, for all men seem beasts to me now. He is definitely dead, and there is his grave. I cannot read what's written on his tomb. I'll use wax to mold out the lettering. My captain can read any kind of lettering, for despite being young he's an experienced interpreter. In front of Athens the man whose ambition was his downfall is set down by these words.
Make sure this cowardly and dirty town hears our troops approach.
Previously, you filled your days by using your own power unchecked, making your own personal desires equivalent with justice. Before now I and people like me slept in the shadow of your power, walking about with folded arms and voicing our opinions only in vain. Now is the time for action, when the bones of those bowing down to you finally cry out, "No more!" Now those supposed wrongdoers, voiceless then, will have the opportunity to sit in your positions of power. And those who were supposedly ill-mannered during your time shall be able to say and do whatever they like.
Young, honorable, Alcibiades, when your grievances were just an idea, before you had any power and we had any fear of it, we sent assistance to you to apologize for our ingratitude with endless admiration.
And we also tried to reach out to Timon and express our city's love for him with a message of humility and promised riches. We were not unkind, and we do not deserve to fall to war.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* These walls of ours were not built by the people who insulted you, nor were they people that deserve their work to fall for the faults of others.
The people who banished you are no longer living. Their shame at their actions broke their hearts. March into our city with your banners, Alcibiades, and if in an unnatural hunger for revenge you'd like to kill one tenth of the entire city, let those unfortunate enough to have gotten such a bad turn of the dice die for all the rest.
It is not everyone's fault that you are offended. It is not fair to avenge yourself on those that are here now for those who offended you then. Crimes should not be inherited like the land. Dear countrymen, bring in your army, but leave without your anger. Spare your hometown of Athens and those people who in your wrath you might otherwise kill. Be like a shepherd and approach the herd and separate the infected parts of it. Do not kill everyone.
Whatever you want, enforce it with mercy and not with violence.
Set your foot against the ramped-up walls and they will open, but you should tell us before you come in peace.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Throw your gauntlet down, but do it so that you may use your army to redress the wrongs done to you, and not to destroy everyone here. You can put your entire force here peacefully until you get what you want.
There's my glove, then. Descend now and open your gates. Those who were enemies of Timon and me you will hand over. They, and no one else, will die. And to calm your fear of me, no man of mine shall go beyond an assigned area, or disturb the peace within the city. If they do they will have to answer to harsh punishment.
Well said.
Descend and do what you have promised.
My noble general, Timon is dead. His grave lies on the shore, and on that tombstone there is this epitaph, which I brought here on wax which will show you what I cannot in ignorance.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Reading the epitaph] "Here lies a poor corpse and a poor, disturbed soul. Do not look for my name, and may a disease strike all you remaining cowards! Here I lie, Timon, who when alive all living men hated. Pass here and insult me to your heart's content, but go and do not stay here too long." [Speaking about TIMON] These words describe you in the depression of your later life. Though you hated our human grievances, scorned our tears which from our sad dispositions fell, still your ingenious mind taught you to make the god of the sea cry for you on your low grave, on your forgiven faults. The noble Timon is dead, who will be remembered from now on. Bring me into your city, and I will combine peace with war. I will make war end in peace, then make peace stop war, as if each were the doctors curing the other. Strike the drums.
Noble patricians, since you support my right to rule, defend my just cause with weapons. And countrymen, my loyal followers, fight for my inheritance with your swords: I am the first-born son of the last emperor, so let me take the crown and don't make me lower myself to ask for it.
Romans, friends, followers, supporters of my right to rule—if Bassianus, Caesar's son, ever had a good reputation in the eyes of royal Rome, then block this man's path. Don't let dishonor approach the imperial throne, where there should be only virtue, justice, restraint, and nobility. Instead, elect someone who deserves it, and Romans, fight for your right to freely choose your own emperor.
Ambitious princes, fighting each other to become emperor! The people of Rome, whom I have been elected to represent, have voted and chosen Andronicus—called "Andronicus Pius" for all his great deeds, since there's no nobler man or braver warrior in all of Rome—as their new emperor. The Senate has summoned him home from the war against the barbaric Goths. With his sons, he defeated a strong nation that trains its warriors from their birth. It’s been ten years since he first went to war and punished our enemies' pride with his weapons; he’s come back five times, bearing the dead bodies of his brave sons. And now at last, bringing prizes won during war, the famous Titus Andronicus returns to Rome in triumph. Let us ask you—out of respect for the late emperor, the Capitol, and the Senate, which you claim to honor—that you back down, dismiss your followers, and make your case peacefully and humbly.

* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marcus Andronicus, I have much respect for your honesty and integrity. And I have so much love and honor for you and your family—your noble brother Titus and his sons, and lovely Lavinia, the object of my affections—that I will dismiss my followers, and let the people decide my fate.
Friends and supporters: I thank you and dismiss you all, relying only on the love and respect of my country to judge my cause.
Rome, be as fair and gracious to me as I’ve been straightforward and kind to you. Open the gates, and let me in.
Tribunes, let me—a poor competitor—in, too.
Romans, make way: the good Andronicus, model of virtue, Rome’s best champion, victorious in battle, returns from the wars with honor and good fortune, having defeated and captured our enemies.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hail Rome, victorious even in your mourning clothes! Like the ship returned home with treasures from abroad, Andronicus comes crowned with laurels of victory, to re-salute his country with tears—tears of true joy—for his return. Jupiter Capitolinus, defender of the city, accept our offering! Romans, these men are all that’s left of my twenty-five sons (half the number that King Priam had). Look at them! The ones who are still alive deserve your love and gratitude; the ones who are dead I will bury with their ancestors. Here, for once, I’m putting down my sword. Titus, you've been unkind and careless to your own children. Why do you allow your unburied sons to remain on the shores of the Styx? Make way, so that I can bury them with their brothers.
There you can speak to each other in silence, as the dead do, and sleep in peace, you who died fighting for your country. Oh, sacred home of my children, of virtue and nobility, you have taken so many of my sons but will never return any to me.
Give us the highest-ranking Goth prisoner, so that we can cut his limbs and for the spirits of our brothers sacrifice him in front of this tomb: that way their spirits will be at rest and they won't haunt us.
I give you the noblest of my prisoners, the eldest son of this defeated queen.
Stop, Roman friends! Gracious conqueror, victorious Titus, pity the tears I shed, for they’re a mother’s tears for her son. If you ever loved your sons, imagine that I love my son just as much! Isn’t it enough that we’re brought to Rome, to add to your triumph, as your prisoners? Do you also have to slaughter my sons in the streets, just because they fought to protect their homeland? If your sons were brave to fight for their country, then mine were as well. Andronicus, don’t stain your tomb with blood: don’t you want to be like a god? Be like a god in being merciful, for sweet mercy is the truest sign of nobility. Noble Titus, let my first-born son live.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Calm yourself, madam, and forgive me. These are their brothers, who you saw alive and dead, and for their dead brothers they ask a religious sacrifice. Your son must die, to satisfy the ghosts of the dead.
Take him away! And build a fire: let’s cut him to pieces with our swords on a pile of wood, until he’s consumed by the flames.
Oh, cruel, irreligious faith!
Were the Scythians ever so barbaric?
Ambitious Rome is no better than Scythia. Alarbus is dead, and we live only as Titus’s prisoners. Then, madam, prepare for death. But don’t give up hope that the gods —who gave the Queen of Troy opportunity to take revenge on the Thracian tyrant in his tent—might favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths (when you were still queen and we were still Goths, that is) to give them what they deserve.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* See, lord and father, how we’ve done our Roman sacrifice: Alarbus's limbs are cut off and his innards feed the fire as the smoke perfumes the sky. There's nothing else to do but bury our brothers and welcome them to Rome with celebration.
Let it be so, but first Andronicus will say a last goodbye to their souls.
Rest in peace and honor here, my sons: you were always ready to serve Rome, so rest here safe from any more suffering. Here there’s no treason, no jealousy, no grudges. Here are no storms, no noise, but just silence and eternal sleep: rest in peace and honor here, my sons!
Lord Titus, my noble lord and father, may you live forever in peace, honor, and good reputation! I cry at this tomb for my brothers, and I kneel at your feet with tears of joy for your return to Rome. Oh, bless me with your victorious hand, applauded by Rome’s best citizens!
Kind Rome, you have given me this sweet medicine to make my heart happy again. Lavinia, live: outlive your father, and may everyone remember your virtue after you’re gone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother, gracious victor in the eyes of Rome!
Thanks, kind tribune, noble brother Marcus.
And welcome, nephews, from successful wars—both you who survived and you that died. Lords, everyone who fought for his country is equal in our eyes.  Your dead sons' funeral is a greater triumph than the happiness we who survive enjoy, for they have achieved the honor and security Solon praised. But Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome—you’ve always been their friend—have sent me, their tribune, to give you this white palliament and tell you that they have elected you as their emperor. Be candidatus with the sons of our late emperor, then, and put it on, helping to set a head on headless Rome.
Her glorious body could do with a better head, one that doesn’t shake with age and weakness. Why should I put on this robe, and trouble you? If you choose me today, tomorrow I’ll die, and you’ll have to go about the whole business again. Rome, I have been your soldier for forty years, led my country's army successfully, and buried twenty-one brave sons, killed fighting for their country. Give me a staff of honor in my old age, but not a scepter to control the world: the last one who held it was stronger than I am.
Titus, you will be emperor if you ask for it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Proud and ambitious tribune, how can you tell?
Calm down, Prince Saturninus.
Romans, do the right thing: patricians, draw your swords, and don’t put them away until Saturninus is Rome’s emperor. Andronicus, I’d rather you were shipped to hell than steal the people’s love from me!
Proud Saturnine, you’re getting in your own way—Titus is trying to do you a favor!
It will be all right, prince; I’ll make the people love you again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Andronicus, I say without flattery that I respect you, and will do so until I die. If you give me your support, I’ll be thankful to you; and thanks is good food for honorable men.
People of Rome, and their representatives here, I ask for your voices and your votes: will you let Andronicus choose the next emperor?
To please the good Andronicus, and celebrate his safe return to Rome, the people will accept whom he recommends.
Tribunes, thank you: I ask you to elect the emperor's eldest son, Lord Saturnine. I hope his virtues will shine on Rome like the sun, ripening justice in our country. So if you will elect him on my recommendation, crown him and say "Long live our emperor!"
With the voices of us all—patricians and plebeians—we elect Lord Saturninus as Rome's great emperor, and say "Long live our Emperor Saturnine!"
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Titus Andronicus, I thank you for the favor you’ve done me, and in return will show my gratitude with actions. To bring your family up in the world, I’ll marry your daughter Lavinia in the holy Pantheon and make her Rome’s empress and mistress of my heart. Tell me, Andronicus, does this please you?
It does, my worthy lord; you honor me with this match. And here in front of all Rome, I give to you my sword, my chariot, and my prisoners, presents worthy of Rome’s imperial lord: take them then, as the tribute I owe you.
Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life! Rome will know how proud I am of you and your gifts, and when I forget the least of them, Romans, forget your loyalty to me.
[To TAMORA] Now, madam, you're the prisoner of an emperor; out of respect for your honor and rank, he'll treat you and your followers well.
A lovely lady, trust me; of the sort that I would choose, if I could choose again. Don't make that sad face, beautiful queen: although you've been defeated in war, you aren't in Rome to be humiliated. You'll be treated like a queen in every way. Trust me, and don't let grief blight your hopes: madam, the man that comforts you can make you greater than the Queen of Goths. Lavinia, aren't you angry about this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not I, my lord; a king should speak nobly and courteously.
Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go; we set these prisoners free without ransom. Celebrate our honor, lords, with trumpets and drums.
Lord Titus, with all due respect, this girl is mine.
How could this be, sir? Are you serious, my lord?
Yes, noble Titus; and I'm prepared to fight for her.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* "To each his own" is our Roman law; this prince takes what is his by right.
And that he will, and shall, if Lucius is alive to fight for it.
Traitors, stop! Where are the emperor's guards? Treason, my lord! Lavinia is taken!
Taken! By whom?
By her betrothed, who can justly take her away from all the world.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Brothers, help me take her away, and I'll guard this door with my sword.
[To SATURNINUS] Come with me, my lord, and I'll bring her back soon.
My lord, you can't pass me.
What, stupid boy! You stand in my way in Rome?
Help, Lucius, help!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, you are wrong, and, more than that, you've killed your own son.
He's no son of mine, and nor are you: my sons would never dishonor me like this. Traitor, give Lavinia to the emperor.
I'll give her to you dead, if you want; but she'll never be his wife. She is lawfully betrothed to another.
No, Titus, no; the emperor doesn't need her, nor you, nor any of your family. I might learn to trust a man again after he made fun of me once; but I'll never trust you, nor your traitorous and proud sons, since you all planned together to dishonor me. Wasn't there anyone else in Rome that you could mock other than Saturnine? This stunt perfectly matches your ridiculous brag that I begged you to give me the empire.
Oh, monstrous! Why are you saying these cruel things to me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But go away; go give your silly daughter to the man who waved his sword around for her. You'll have a brave son-in-law, one fit to squabble with your law-breaking sons, disturbing the peace in Rome.
These words cut my wounded heart like knives.
And so, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths—that, like Phoebe among her nymphs, outshines all the loveliest women of Rome—if you accept my sudden proposal, I choose you, Tamora, for my wife, and will make you empress of Rome. Say something, Queen of Goths, do you approve of my choice? And I promise by all the Roman gods, since we have the priest, the holy water, and the candles here already, I won't go out into the streets of Rome or to my palace until we're married.
And here, by heaven, I swear to Rome that if Saturnine marries the Queen of Goths, she will be a servant to his desires, a loving nurse, and a mother to his youth.
Come up, my fair queen, and let's go to the Pantheon. Lords, come with your noble emperor and his lovely bride, sent from heaven to Prince Saturnine, who has wisely looked past her misfortune—there we will be married.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am not asked to go with them. Titus, when was the last time you walked alone, dishonored and accused of doing wrong?
Oh, Titus, see, oh, see what you have done! In a rash fight you've killed a virtuous son.
No, foolish tribune, no; he was no son of mine, nor are you, nor these, who participated in dishonoring our family. Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!
But at least let us bury him, as we should; give Mutius burial with our brothers.
Traitors, go away! He won't rest in this tomb: this monument has stood for five hundred years, and I have restored it at great expense, and only Rome's soldiers and servants are buried here in here, not those killed in low street fights. Bury him wherever you want, since he won't be buried here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, this is not fair. My nephew Mutius did something honorable; he must be buried with his brothers.
And he shall, or we'll go with him to the grave.
"And shall!" What villain said that?
He that would fight for it in any place less holy than here.
What, would you bury him here without my permission?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, noble Titus, but we beg you to pardon Mutius and bury him.
Marcus, even you are against me; and with these boys, you've wounded my honor. You're all my enemies, so don't bother me anymore, but go away.
He is not himself; let's go.
I won't go until we've buried Mutius.
Brother, for that word reminds you of the natural ties between us—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Father, and in that word nature speaks too—
Don't say anything else, if this is going where I think it is.
Famous Titus, more than half my soul—
Dear father, soul and body of us all—
Let your brother Marcus bury his noble nephew here with honor, since he died for Lavinia's cause. You are a Roman; don't be uncivilized. The Greeks buried Ajax, although he killed himself, after wise Laertes's son begged for a funeral: so don't let young Mutius, who you loved, be prevented from joining his brothers.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Get up, Marcus, get up. This is the saddest day I ever saw, to be dishonored by my sons in Rome! Well, bury him, and bury me next.
Lie there, sweet Mutius, with your friends, until we cover your tomb with trophies won in battle.
[Kneeling] Let no one cry for noble Mutius, since the person who dies fighting for what's right will live forever in memory.
My lord, to leave these sad thoughts behind: how did it happen that the clever Queen of Goths is suddenly our empress?
I don't know, Marcus; but I know it's happened, and whether by some trickery or not, only the heavens can tell. But shouldn't she feel grateful to the man who has raised her so high? Yes, and she'll respond in kind.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So, Bassianus, you have won your prize. God make you happy with your lovely bride!
And you with yours, my lord! I have nothing else to say, and don't wish you any less, so I'll go now.
Traitor, if there's law in Rome or if we have power, you and your brothers will regret this rape.
You call it rape, my lord, to take my own, my true love and fiancee and now my wife? But let the law of Rome take its course; in the meantime, I have what is mine.
All right, sir, you are very rude to us. But, if we live, you might find that I can be as sharp with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, I'll answer for what I've done, with my life if I must. But I'll just say this: I swear by my duty to Rome that this noble gentleman, Lord Titus here, has suffered a wrong at your hands. In the rescue of Lavinia, he killed his youngest son out of loyalty to you and in anger at being forced to go back on his word. Favor him, then, Saturnine, since he's proven himself in everything he does to be a father and friend to you and Rome.
Prince Bassianus, I can defend myself without your help; it's you and your friends who have dishonored me. Rome and heaven above know my love and loyalty to Saturnine!
My worthy lord, if you ever loved Tamora, then let me speak as a neutral party. At my request, sweetheart, forgive what's in the past.
What, madam! Can I put up with these insults?
Of course not, my lord; the gods of Rome forbid that I would urge you to do anything dishonorable! But I vouch for good Lord Titus's innocence in everything; you can see his grief on his face. Then, at my request, forgive him. Don't lose a noble friend out of suspicion, or hurt his soft heart with angry looks. [So only SATURNINUS can hear] Saturninus, let me convince you, listen to me: do not reveal your grief and unhappiness. You just took the throne—so, unless you want the people and patricians to take Titus's side, and unseat you for not being grateful to him (and Romans hate ingratitude), forgive him. And then let me work: I'll find a day to kill them all. I'll destroy their faction and family, the cruel father and his traitorous sons—to whom I begged for my son's life. I'll make them know what happens to those who let a queen kneel in the streets and beg in vain. [To all] Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus. Raise up this good old man, and cheer him up, since he's miserable when you frown at him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Rise, Titus, rise; my empress has convinced me.
I thank your majesty, and her, my lord. These words and looks of forgiveness give new life to me.
Titus, I am now a Roman, and must give the emperor good advice. Let's forget all our past quarrels today, Andronicus; and let it be my chief accomplishment that I've brought you all back together. For you, Prince Bassianus, I have promised the emperor that you'll be more mild and obedient in the future. And don't be afraid, lords, and you, Lavinia: take my advice, kneel down, and ask his majesty for forgiveness.
[Kneeling] We do, and promise heaven and his highness, that we were as moderate as we could be, when our sister's honor and our own was at stake.
[Kneeling] I vow that too, on my honor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go away, and be quiet; don't bother us anymore.
No, no, sweet emperor; we must all be friends. The tribune and his nephews kneel for forgiveness. I won't be denied: sweetheart, look at them.
Marcus, for the sake of you and your brother, and because Tamora begs me, I forgive these young men's crimes against me. Stand up. Lavinia, though you left me harshly, I would not have found my love if you hadn't: I swore that I wouldn't walk away from the priest without a wife. Come, if the emperor's court will celebrate two brides, you'll be my guest, Lavinia, and your family. This day will be a love-day, Tamora.
Tomorrow, if your majesty likes, we can go hunting for panther and deer. We'll wake you with the sounds of our dogs and horns.
We will come, Titus, and many thanks to you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So now Tamora is as high as Olympus, safe from misfortune and jealousy. She's safe from both thunder's crack and lightning's flash, having ascended farther than envy can reach. She's like the golden sun that greets the morning, and, having crowned the ocean with its beams, gallops across the sky in a glittering coach and looks down on even the highest hills. Honorable and virtuous men wait for her words, and tremble when she frowns. Then, Aaron, arm your heart and make your thoughts fit to go to the top with your imperial mistress—since she's been your prisoner in love for a long time, bound to you with tighter chains that Prometheus was tied to that rock in the Caucasus. Cast away poor clothing and low thoughts! I will be bright, shining in pearl and gold, when I serve this new-made empress. Did I say serve? I meant that I'll play with this queen, this goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph, this siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine, and lead him to his ruin. But what's all this noise?
Chiron, you're young and stupid, and you don't have what it takes to get in my way and intrude where I'm welcome.
Demetrius, you've always been arrogant, and it's no different in this. You're only a year or two older than me, and that doesn't make you any better. I'm as fit as you to serve my mistress and make her love me. And I'll prove it with my sword, to show how much I want Lavinia's love.
[To himself] I'll have to call the guards; these lovers will start fighting each other soon.
Why, boy, ever since our mother gave you a toy sword you've been desperate to start brandishing it around. Give it to me; I'll glue it to its sheath until you know how to handle it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Before that, sir, I'll use the little skill I have to show you how ready I am to use it.
What, boy, are you so brave now?
[Coming forward] What's this, lords? How can you openly draw your swords so close to the emperor's palace? I know why you're fighting: I wouldn't take a million gold coins to let them know why. Your noble mother wouldn't take so much more to let you dishonor her in Rome. For God's sake, put your swords away.
I won't, not until I've stabbed him and thrown his insulting words back down his throat.
I'm prepared for that. You coward, talking about what you don't dare to do yourself!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Put it away, I say! This stupid fight will ruin us all. Lords, haven't you thought how dangerous it is to try to seduce a prince's wife? Is Lavinia so loose, or Bassianus so corrupt, that you can fight over her love without bringing disaster on your heads? Young lords, watch yourselves! If the empress knew about this, she wouldn't be happy.
I don't care if she or anyone else knows it: I love Lavinia more than all the world.
Young man, choose someone else: Lavinia is your elder brother's choice.
What, are you crazy? Don't you know how jealous Romans are of their competitors in love? I tell you, lords, you're going to get yourselves killed.
Aaron, I'd die a thousand times to have her.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To have her! How?
Why do you sound so surprised? She is a woman, so can be wooed; she's a woman, and so can be won; she is Lavinia, so she must be loved. You know what I mean, man: more water goes by the mill than the miller knows about, and it's a simple thing to steal a slice of a loaf of bread. Bassianus is the emperor's brother, but greater men that him have been cheated on by their wives.
[To himself] True—even a man as great as Saturninus can be cheated.
Then, it should be no problem for a man who knows how to flirt with a woman, seeming generous and charming. What, haven't you often killed a deer right under her owner's nose?
Why, then it seems a quick hunt would serve your purposes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, if that would do it.
Aaron, you're right on point there.
I wish you were as sharp! Then we wouldn't be making all this fuss. Why—listen to me!—are you fighting each other over her? Would you be offended if you both succeeded?
No, not me.
Nor I, as long as I got what I wanted.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, then why don't you work together: if you want her, you'll need a plan. You must decide that if you can't have it as you would ideally want, then you will have it however you can. Take my word for it: Lavinia, Bassianus's love, is as chaste as Lucrece. We have to find a quicker way than trying to persuade her, since that will never work, and I have just the path in mind. My lords, tomorrow we're all going hunting, and the lovely Roman ladies will come along: the forest paths are wide and spacious, and there are many isolated places fit for rape and other crimes. Bring this pretty doe there alone, and take her by force, if not by words: this is your only hope. Come on, and let's tell our empress our villainous and vengeful plans; all her energy is devoted to revenge. She will improve on our plans with her advice, and will make sure you don't mess up those plans by fighting amongst yourselves. You'll both get what you want. The emperor's palace is as full of tongues, eyes, and ears as the House of Fame; you'll have no privacy there. But the woods are pitiless, dreadful, and hear nothing; that's where you can do what you want, brave boys, and take your turns with Lavinia. There you can satisfy your lusts in the shadows, where heaven can't see, and enjoy the treasures of her body.
Your advice is good, friend.
Whether it's right or wrong, I must have her: until I find the stream to cool my heat, or some medicine to calm me down, I live in hell.
It's time to hunt—the morning is bright and gray, the fields are sweet-smelling, and the trees are in bloom. Let's separate here and make some noise to wake up the emperor and his lovely bride; we'll make enough sound to wake up the prince too, and the whole court. Sons, make sure you watch the emperor carefully, as I will. I had a bad night's sleep, but felt better when I woke up.
Good morning, your majesty; and madam, good morning to you, too. I promised that I would wake you up with the sound of the hunt.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And you have made quite a noise, my lord—somewhat too early for ladies who just got married.
Lavinia, what do you think?
I disagree; I've been awake for more than two hours already.
Come on, then; let's get our horses and chariots and begin the hunt.[To TAMORA] Madam, now you'll see our Roman hunting.
I have dogs, my lord, that can outrun the proudest panther in the chase, and climb the highest tops of the mountains.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And I have horses that will follow wherever the prey goes, flying like swallows over the open field.
Chiron, we don't hunt with horses or dogs—but hope to catch a dainty doe, nonetheless.
A smart man would think it's stupid to bury so much gold under a tree and never use it. But I would tell him that I do this for a plot: which, when it comes to pass, will make for some excellent wickedness. So rest there, sweet gold, and cause unrest.
and take revenge on the empress's enemies.
My lovely Aaron, why do you look sad when everything is so beautiful? The birds are singing, the snake sleeps under the cheerful sun, and the green leaves enjoy the cooling wind, which makes a shadow on the ground. Let's sit down in the shade, Aaron, and while sounds of the noisy hunt move through the wood, the echoes replying to the horns' call as if two hunts were happening at once, we'll stay here and listen. We'll be like Dido and her wandering prince, who took shelter in a cave during a storm. I can imagine what they go up to in there, all alone. After our lovers' sport, we'll have a glorious nap. As we rest in each other's arms, the sounds of the hunt and the songs of sweet birds will lull us to sleep.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, while the goddess Venus makes you think of love, the god Saturn makes me think of destruction and death. My angry looks, my silence, my sad mood, and my hair that uncurls like a snake uncoiling itself to strike, have nothing to do with sexual desire. Instead, they show that I'm planning to take vengeance: revenge and blood are all I can think of. Listen, Tamora—empress of my soul, since I don't hope for salvation after death—Bassianus will die today. His Philomel must lose her tongue, for your sons plan to rape her and wash their hands in his blood. See this letter? [Gives it to her] Take it, and give it to the king. Don't ask me anymore; someone has seen us. Here come our victims, although they don't know it yet.
Oh, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!
No more, great empress; Bassianus is here. Find some reason to argue with him; meanwhile, I'll go get your sons so they can take revenge for you.
Who have we here? Rome's royal empress, all alone with no servants? Or is it the goddess Diana who has left her holy groves to come see the hunt?
How dare you intrude on me like this! If I had Diana's powers, I'd put horns on your head like Actaeon's, and let the dogs tear you to pieces for disturbing my privacy!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, but gentle empress, we know you have a talent for horning. And I'm sure you and your Moor are here together: I hope your husband's dogs don't take him for a stag.
Believe me, queen, your swarthy Cimmerian is turning you as black as him, disgusting and hateful. Why did you sneak away from all your servants, get off your snowy white horse, and wander to this isolated forest clearing, accompanied only by a barbaric Moor—if your foul desires didn't bring you here?
And, since we've caught you in the act, my noble lord has good reason to talk to you like this. [To BASSIANUS] Let's go, and let her enjoy her raven-colored lover; this ugly valley is perfect for her purposes.
The king, my brother, will know about this.
Yes, for people have noticed that you keep slipping away. The good king has been tricked one too many times!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why do I have the patience to listen to you?
What's the matter, dear queen and beloved mother? Why do you look so pale?
Don't you think I have reason to look pale? These two lured me to this isolated valley—a foul place, as you can see, where the trees are bare even in the summer, covered in moss and mistletoe, where the sun never shines and nothing lives but owls and ravens—and showed me this horrible pit in the ground. They told me that, at night, it's filled with a thousand demons, snakes toads, and goblins, who make such awful noise that anyone hearing it would go mad or fall dead. No sooner had they said this, but they added that they would tie me here to a tree and leave me to a miserable death. Then they called me a foul adulteress, lustful Goth, and all the worst insults you've ever heard. If you hadn't come to rescue me, they would have killed me. Take revenge, as you love your mother, or never call yourself my children again.
I'll show you that I'm your son.
And take this, too, to show my strength.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, Semiramis—no, barbaric Tamora—for there's no better name to fit your barbaric nature than your own!
[To Demetrius] Give me your knife; you'll see, my boys, that your mother's own hand will take revenge.
Stop, madam; we have more plans for her. Don't burn the straw until you've thrashed the corn. This girl acts like a chaste lady and puts herself above you, parading her faithfulness in her marriage; do you want her to die with that satisfaction?
And if she does, I'd rather be a eunuch. Drag her husband to some secret hole, and we'll rape her on his dead body.
But when you have the honey you want, don't let the wasp live to sting us.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I promise you, madam, we'll make sure of that. Come, mistress, now we'll enjoy that "honesty" of yours that you're so anxious to preserve.
Oh, Tamora! You have the face of a woman—
I will not listen to her speak; take her away!
Sweet lords, just let me say one thing to her.
Listen, dear madam; it's your glory to see her cry. Let her tears fall like rain on your heart of stone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Since when did the tiger's cubs teach their mother? Oh, don't teach her how to be angry; she taught you how—the milk you sucked from her turned to marble, and even at her breast you learned cruelty. But not every mother breeds the same sons—[To CHIRON] Beg her to show me a woman's pity.
What, and show myself a bastard? I'm my mother's son.
It's true; a raven can't give birth to a lark.  But I’ve heard—oh, if only this could happen now!—that the lion has cut off his claws for pity, and that ravens have cared for orphaned children while their own birds starved in their nests. Oh, be to me—although your hard heart says no—if not as kind, then at least a bit merciful!
I don't know what she means; take her away!
Oh, let me explain myself! For my father’s sake—since he didn’t kill you when he might have done so—listen to me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Even if you had never offended me yourself (which you have), I’m merciless for his sake. Remember, boys, how I begged and cried in vain to save your brother from the sacrifice, but fierce Andronicus would not show pity. So take her away, and do whatever you want with her: the worse you treat her, the more I’ll love you.
Oh, Tamora, be a gentle queen, and kill me with your own hands in this place! For it isn’t my life that I’ve been begging for—I was killed when Bassianus died.
What are you asking for, then? Stupid girl, let me go.
It's death now that I beg for—and one thing more, that I can barely speak for modesty's sake. Oh, keep me from their lust, which is worse than killing me, and throw me into some loathsome pit where no one will ever see my body. Do this, and be a charitable murderer.
But if I did that, I would rob my sweet sons of their reward. No, I'll let them satisfy their lust with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come on! You've kept us here too long.
No pity? No womanhood? Oh, foul creature, a blot on the name of all women! May you—
No, then I'll stop you from talking anymore.[To DEMETRIUS] Bring her husband's body; this is the hole where Aaron told us to throw him.
Goodbye, my sons; make sure she isn't a threat to us. I'll never be happy until all the Andronici family are dead. Now I'll go find my lovely Moor, and let my angry sons enjoy their prize.
Come on, my lords, quickly: I'll bring you to the foul pit where I saw a panther fast asleep.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My eyelids are very heavy, whatever that means.
And mine, too; if I weren't embarrassed to do so, I would stop hunting and sleep for a bit.
Where have you fallen? What sort of hole is this, covered in branches with blood on their leaves like the morning dew on flowers? It seems like a very deadly place to me. Tell me, brother, did you hurt yourself when you fell?
Oh, brother, I've seen something that hurt me worse than anything  I've seen before!
[To himself] Now I'll bring the king, who, when he finds them here, will assume that they killed his brother.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why don't you help me out of this horrible blood-stained hole?
I am paralyzed with fear; I feel a cold sweat all over my body, and my heart suspects more than I can see at the moment.
You're right to be afraid: if you and Aaron look into this hole, you'll see blood and death.
Aaron is gone; I'm afraid to look at the thing I fear. Oh, tell me when you see; before now I was never so childish as to fear something I couldn't see.
Lord Bassianus lies here like a slaughtered lamb, in this horrible, dark, blood-soaked pit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If it's dark, how do you know it's him?
He wears a ring on his bloody finger that lights the hole like a flaming candle in a tomb, shining on his cheeks and showing the disgusting insides of the pit. The moon shined like that on Pyramus, covered in a maiden's blood at night. Oh, brother, help me out of here with your weak hand—if fear has made you weak too, as it has me—so that I can get out of this foul hole, as horrible as the mouth of Cocytus.
Give me your hand, so that I can help you. Or, if I don't have the strength to lift you out, I'll fall into this pit (this womb that swallows instead of giving life and has become Bassianus's grave) with you. I don't have enough strength to pull you to the top.
And I don't have the strength to climb without your help.
Give me your hand again; I won't let go until you're up here or I'm down there. You can't come to me—I'll come to you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come follow me; I'll see what kind of hole this is, and who just leaped into it. [Calling down into the hole] Who are you down there, who just jumped in?
The unlucky son of old Andronicus, who stumbling on this hole has found the dead body of your brother Bassianus.
My brother dead! I know you must be joking—he and his wife are both back at the lodge on the north side of the forest; I saw them an hour ago.
We don't know where you left him alive. But out here—God forbid—we found him dead.
Where is my lord, the king?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here, Tamora, although greatly distressed.
Where is your brother Bassianus?
Now you've hit on the subject of my suffering: poor  Bassianus lies in this hole, murdered.
Then I'm too late in showing you this letter, which reveals the whole plot! I'm shocked that people can smile and be so murderous.
[Reads] "And if we fail to meet him on the hunt—meaning Bassianus—just dig the grave for him: you understand us. Your money is buried by the elder-tree near the same pit where we decided to bury Bassianus. If you do this, we'll be your friends for life." [To TAMORA] Oh, Tamora! Have you ever heard anything like this? This is the pit, and this is the elder-tree. [To servants] Find the hunter that planned to murder Bassianus here!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My gracious lord, here's the bag of gold.
[To TITUS] Two of your sons, bloody dogs, have killed my brother here. Drag them from the pit and put them in prison, and leave them there until I've invented some previously unheard-of torture for them.
What, are they in this pit? Oh, it's amazing how easy it is to solve murders!
Mighty emperor, I beg on my knees with tears not easily shed. If this foul crime of my cursed sons—cursed if they're guilty of it—
If  they're guilty! It's obvious that they are. Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Andronicus himself found it in the woods.
I did, my lord. But let me bail them, and by my father's honored grave, I promise I'll produce them for the trial.
You won't bail them; follow me. Someone bring the dead body, and someone bring the murderers. Don't let them speak; their guilt is obvious. By God, if there were some worse fate than death, I'd punish them that way.
Andronicus, I'll advocate for you with the king. Don't worry for your sons; they'll be all right.
Come, Lucius; don't stay to talk with them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So, now go try to tell what happened—if your tongue can speak, say who cut out your tongue and raped you.
Write it down and explain yourself that way—if you can write with those stumps.
See, she can say what she means by gesturing at us.
Go home, ask for sweet water to wash your hands.
She has no tongue to speak and no hands to wash, so let's leave her to walk alone in silence.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If it were me, I'd hang myself.
If you had hands to help you tie the knot.
Who is this? [Sees LAVINIA] My niece, running away from me so fast! Cousin, wait; where's your husband? If I'm dreaming, I would give everything I own to wake up from this nightmare! And if I did wake up, I'd want to die rather than see this. Tell me, sweet niece, who has cut off those two branches, your arms, which kings have desired to sleep in, and thought there could be no greater happiness than to have your love? Why don't you speak to me? Oh, a red river of blood falls from your lips like a fountain, stirred by the wind of your sweet breath. Surely some Tereus has raped you, and, to stop you from naming him, has cut out your tongue. Ah, now you turn away your face, ashamed, and you blush—although you've lost so much blood already from three different spouts. Your cheeks are as red as the sun, that blushes when hidden by a cloud. Can I speak for you? Can I say that I have it right? Oh, I wish I knew what was in your heart—and that I knew the beast who did this, so that I could vent my rage at him. Unexpressed sorrow burns the heart to ashes. Fair Philomela just lost her tongue, and sewed a picture of what was done to her; but, lovely niece, that method won't work for you, since a more cunning Tereus has cut off those pretty fingers that could have sewed better than Philomel. Oh, if the monster had seen those white hands play the lute and make the strings themselves want to kiss them, he would not have touched them were his life at stake! Or if he'd heard the sweet music of your voice, he would have dropped his knife and fallen asleep like Cerberus at the feet of the Thracian poet. Come with me, let's find your father, and make him blind—for such a sight would blind any father's eye with tears. An hour of rain can drown a meadow; what will whole months of tears do to your father's eyes? Don't move away, but come with me, for we'll mourn with you. Oh, if only our mourning could ease your misery!
Listen to me, respected men! Noble tribunes, wait! Take pity on me—for my lost youth, which I spent in dangerous wars while you slept securely at home; for all the blood I’ve spilled for Rome; for all the cold nights when I stayed up guarding the camp; for the bitter tears that now run down my wrinkled cheeks—and have mercy on my sons, who are more innocent than you think. I never cried for my twenty-two sons who died before, because they died with honor.
But for these sons, tribunes, I cry so that my tears write my sorrow in the dust, quenching the earth’s thirst. The sweet blood of my sons will make it blush with shame. Oh earth, if you refuse to drink the blood of my dear sons, I’ll give you more rain from my ancient eyes than you ever got in April. In the drought of summer I’ll rain on you still, and in winter I’ll melt the snow with my warm tears and make it eternally spring, if you refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, powerful tribunes! Oh, merciful old men! Release my sons, take back the sentence of death, and let me say—a man who never cried before—that my tears moved you.
Oh, noble father, there’s no point going on like this, for the tribunes can’t hear. No one is here, and you’re only talking to the stones.
Ah, Lucius, let me plead for your brothers. Honorable tribunes, I beg you once again—
My gracious lord, none of the tribunes can hear you.
Why, it doesn't matter if they hear me, man, for they wouldn’t listen to me—or if they did listen, they wouldn’t have mercy. But I have to beg nonetheless. So I tell my sorrows to the stones, which—although they can’t answer me—in some ways are better than the tribunes. For they don’t interrupt my story; when I cry, they seem to cry with me, as my tears trickle down the stones. If they were dressed in mourning clothes, there would be no better tribunes in Rome. A stone is soft as wax, when tribunes are harder than stones. A stone is silent, and never offends, while tribunes doom men to death when they speak.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But why are you standing with your weapon drawn?
To rescue my two brothers from their death sentence—and for that, the judges have banished me from Rome for life.
Oh, happy man! They’ve done you a favor—foolish Lucius, don’t you see that Rome is just a wilderness of tigers? Tigers must kill, and there’s no better prey than me and my family. You’re fortunate, then, to be banished from this place. But who comes here with my brother Marcus?
Titus, prepare your eyes to weep; or, if you don't cry, for your noble heart to break. I bring all-consuming sorrow to you in your old age.
Will sorrow consume me? Let me see it, then.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This was your daughter.
Why, Marcus, so she is.
Oh, this sight kills me!
Faint-hearted boy, get up and look at her. Speak, Lavinia, and tell us what hand has made you handless? What fool has added water to the sea, or brought another torch to burning Troy? For my grief was already at its height before you came, and now like Nilus, overflows all bounds. Give me a sword and I’ll chop off my hands too, for they have fought for Rome in vain and kept me alive to suffer; I’ve held them up in prayer, and they’ve been no use at all. So now all I ask is that one will do me the favor of cutting off the other. It’s good that you have no hands, Lavinia, since hands are useless in doing any service for Rome.
Tell us, sweet sister: who did this to you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, her tongue—that spoke her thoughts so pleasingly—is torn from her mouth, where it sung like a sweet songbird in a pretty cage, enchanting everyone!
Oh, then speak for her—who did this?
She was already like this when I found her. She was wandering in the park trying to hide herself, like a deer that’s received a death wound.
It was my deer, and whoever wounded her has hurt me worse than if he’d killed me. It’s as if I’m standing on a rock surrounded by the sea, watching the tide surge and expecting that each wave will be the one that drowns me. My poor sons are sent to death; my other son is banished; my brother cries for our misfortune. But dear Lavinia—more precious than my soul—gives me the greatest suffering. If I had just seen a picture of you like this, I would have gone mad; what can I do now that I see it in real life? You have no hands to wipe away your tears or tongue to tell me who did this to you; your husband is dead, and your brothers are condemned to death for killing him. Look, Marcus! Oh, Lucius, look at her! When I mentioned her brothers, new tears appeared on her cheeks like honeydew on an almost-withered flower.
Perhaps she cries because they killed her husband, or perhaps because she knows they’re innocent.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If they did kill your husband, then you should be pleased that they’ve been brought to justice. But no, no, they wouldn’t do something so awful; look how sad their sister looks. Sweet Lavinia, let me kiss your lips. Or give some sign to tell me how I can help: should your uncle, your brother Lucius, and I sit around a fountain and weep, so that we see the reflection of our tear-streaked cheeks, like a meadow streaked with slime after a flood? And should we look into the fountain so long that its fresh water turns salty from our tears? Or should we cut off out own hands, like yours? Or should we stop speaking, and spend the rest of our hateful lives miming at each other? What should we do? Let those of us that still have our tongues plan how to be so miserable that future ages will marvel at us.
Sweet father, stop crying; for, seeing you cry, look how my poor sister sobs and weeps.
Calm yourself, dear niece. Good Titus, dry your eyes.
Oh, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, I know that your handkerchief can’t dry my tears, since it’s already so wet with your own.
Oh, my Lavinia, I’ll wipe your cheeks.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Look, Marcus, look! I understand her signs—if she could talk, she’d say to your brother what I just said to you: his handkerchief, also soaked in his tears, won’t help her sad cheeks. Oh, this is a fellowship of suffering, as far from help as Limbo is from heaven!
Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor sends a message—if you love your sons, you, Marcus, Lucius, or any of your family should chop off your hand and send it to the king. With that ransom for their crime, he’ll send both your sons back to you alive.
Oh, generous emperor! Oh, sweet Aaron! Has a raven ever sounded so much like a lark that sings at sunrise? With all my heart, I’ll send the emperor my hand; good Aaron, will you help chop it off?
Wait, father! Your noble hand—that has defeated so many enemies—shouldn’t be sent. My hand will serve the purpose. I’m young and can spare the loss of blood more easily, and so my hand should save my brothers’ lives.
Which of your hands hasn’t defended Rome, wielding a bloody battle axe and wreaking destruction on the enemy’s castle? Oh, both are deserving. My hand has been merely idle; if it ransoms my two nephews from their death, then it’s done something useful.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come on, figure out whose hand should be sent, lest they die before their pardon comes.
My hand will go.
By God, it won't go!
Sirs, stop fighting; my hands are like withered herbs that need to be plucked out of the garden. So we’ll send one of mine.
Dear father, if I’m ever worthy to be called your son, let me save my brothers from death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And, now for the sake of our parents, let me show you a brother’s love.
All right, I'll spare my hand; you two figure it out.
Then I'll go get an axe.
But I'll be the one to use it.
Come quickly, Aaron; I'll deceive them both. Lend me your hand, and I'll give you mine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To himself] If this is called lying, then I’ll be honest, and never lie to men like this as long as I live. But I’ll trick you another way, as you’ll see less than half an hour from now.
Now stop fighting: what’s done is done. Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand. Tell him it was a hand that defended him from a thousand dangers; ask him to bury it, since it deserved more than this. As for my sons, say I think of this as a good exchange, jewels for a cheap price—although precious, too, since I’ve bought back my own.
I’ll go, Andronicus; and in exchange for your hand, you’ll soon have your sons with you.[To himself] Their heads, I mean. Oh, the very thought of this villainy delights me even before I’ve done it! Let fools do good deeds, and fair men call for mercy. Aaron will have his soul as black as his face.
Oh, now I lift my one hand up to pray to heaven, and kneel on the ground with my feeble body: if any power pities the tears of the miserable, I call on that![To LAVINIA] What, will you kneel with me? Do then, dear heart, for heaven will hear our prayers: we’ll break the dim sky with our sighs and stain the sun with the fog of our tears, as when it’s overshadowed by rain clouds.
Oh, brother, be rational and don’t break into these fits of extreme passion.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Isn’t my sorrow deep, since there’s no end to it? Then let my passions be bottomless as well.
But still, let reason govern your sorrow.
If there were anything reasonable about these miseries, then I could bind my grief within reasonable limits. When heaven weeps, doesn’t the earth overflow with rain? If the winds blow hard, don’t the waves get higher, threatening the swollen face of the sky? And would you like me to tell you the reason for this storm? I am the sea; see how Lavinia’s sighs blow. She is the weeping sky, and I’m the earth. My sea must be moved with her sighs, and my earth must drown with her continual tears. I can’t hide her sorrow in my bowels, but must vomit it up like a drunken man. Then give me permission, for losers must give relief to their stomachs by talking bitterly.
Worthy Andronicus, you’ve gotten a poor reward for the good hand you sent the emperor. Here are the heads of your two noble sons, and here’s your hand, sent back to you in contempt; your sorrow is a joke to them, and your sacrifice is mocked. It’s worse for me to think of what you’ve suffered than remembering the death of my own father.
Now let hot Etna cool in Sicily, and let my heart burn like hell forever! These miseries are too much to bear. To cry with those who cry does some help, but to mock sorrow is like dying twice.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ah, how can I still be alive after this sight has made such a deep wound in me? Oh, life is no more than a living death, when the only thing that tells us we're still alive is that we breathe in and out.
Oh, poor heart, that kiss can’t give any more comfort than frozen water to a starved snake.
When will we wake up from this horrible dream?
Now I’ll speak plainly. Die, Andronicus, for you’re not asleep. Look at your two sons’ heads, your brave hand, your mangled daughter here, your other banished son struck pale with the sight, your brother—me—like a stone, cold and numb. Oh, now I won’t try to calm you down; tear off your silver hair, bite your one remaining hand with your teeth, and let this sad sight kill us here. Now is the time to despair; why are you so quiet?
Ha, ha, ha!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why are you laughing? It doesn't fit the mood.
Why, I don’t have another tear to shed. Besides, this sorrow is an enemy, which would make my eyes weak by blinding them with tears—how will I find Revenge’s cave then? For these two heads seem to speak to me, threatening that I’ll never be happy again until I take revenge by returning all these offenses in kind, back down the throats of those who have wronged us. Come, let’s see what I have to do. You sad people, circle around me, so that I can turn to each of you and swear on my soul to take revenge on your behalf. The vow is made. [To MARCUS] Come, brother, take a head, and in this hand I’ll carry the other. [To LAVINIA] Lavinia, you’ll have a job too—these arms! Carry my hand between your teeth, sweet girl. [To LUCIUS] As for you, boy, get out of my sight; you’re banished, and must not stay. Go to the Goths and raise an army there, and if you love me—as I think you do—let’s kiss and say goodbye, for we have much to do.
Goodbye, Andronicus, my noble father and the saddest man that ever lived in Rome. Goodbye, proud Rome. Until Lucius comes again, he leaves behind a promise to return, dearer than his life. Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister: oh, if only you were like you were before! But now neither Lucius nor Lavinia lives, except in grief and despair. As long as Lucius lives, he will fight for justice for you, and make proud Saturnine and his empress beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen. Now I’ll go to the Goths, and raise an army to take revenge on Rome and Saturnine.
There, there. Sit down. And make sure you eat no more than will keep us alive long enough to take revenge on our enemies. Marcus, unfold your arms: your niece and I, poor creatures, lack hands and can’t show ten times more sadness by standing like that. Instead, I have to beat my breast with my poor remaining right hand. My heart beats in the hollow prison of my body, enraged with misery, and I thump it down. [To LAVINIA] You map of grief, talking in sign language! When your poor heart beats fast, you can’t strike your chest to make it quiet. Try sighing, my girl, or kill it with groans. Or take a little knife between your teeth and make a hole against your heart, so all the tears that fall from your poor eyes may run in and drown it.
Brother, stop! Don’t tell her how to lay violent hands on herself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh! Has sorrow already made you mad? Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but me. What violent hands can she lay on her life? Why do you use the word “hands?” That’s like asking Aeneas to tell the story again of how Troy was burnt and he lost everything. Oh, don’t say anything about hands, lest we remember that we don’t have any. Ha, but I’m talking foolishly—as if we could forget we have no hands, just because Marcus didn’t mention it! Come, let’s eat. And gentle girl, eat this—what, you won’t drink? Hear what she says, Marcus; I can interpret all her signs. She says she’ll drink nothing but the tears on her cheeks, brewed with her sorrow.[To LAVINIA] Speechless victim, I will learn your thoughts; your silent actions will be as clear in meaning to me as the prayers of hermits. You won’t sigh, or hold your stumps to heaven, or wink, or nod, or kneel, or make a sign without me understanding you: I’ll make an alphabet of these actions, and I’ll learn to know what you mean.
Good grandfather, stop this bitter sadness; make my aunt laugh with some pleasing story.
Oh, the sweet boy, moved by compassion, cries to see his grandfather’s grief.
Calm down, innocent boy; you are made of tears, and tears will melt away your life.
What do you strike at with your knife, Marcus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I struck at a fly, my lord, which I killed.
Get out, murderer! You kill my heart; my eyes are filled with tears at seeing this cruelty. The murder of the innocent doesn’t become Titus’s brother; get out, since I see you aren’t fit for my company.
My lord, I've only killed a fly.
But what if that fly had a father and mother? He would fly on his slender golden wings, buzzing sad songs in the air! Poor harmless fly, that, with his pretty buzzing song, came here to make us happy! And you have killed him.
Forgive me, sir; it was a black ugly fly that looked like the empress’s Moor, which was why I killed him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, oh, oh, then forgive me for attaching you, for you’ve done a good deed. Give me your knife, and I’ll butcher him, pretending it’s the Moor come here to poison me. [Stabs the fly.] Here’s for you, and that’s for Tamora. Ah, bastard! At least we’re not so low; between us we can still kill a fly that looks like a coal-black Moor.
Oh, poor man! He is so grief-stricken that he imagines shadows are the real thing.
Come, let’s go. Lavinia, come with me; I’ll go to your room and read sad stories of old times with you.[To LUCIUS] Come with me, too, boy; your young eyes can read when my own begin to fade.
Help, grandfather, help! My aunt Lavinia follows me everywhere, but I don’t know why. Uncle Marcus, see how quickly she comes after me. Oh, sweet aunt, I don’t know what you mean.
Stand by me, Lucius; don't be afraid of your aunt.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She loves you too much to hurt you, boy.
Yes, when my father was in Rome she did.
What does my niece Lavinia mean by this sign language?
Don’t be afraid of her, Lucius; she means something. See, Lucius, how much she loves you; she wants you to go somewhere with her. Oh, boy, Cornelia never read to her sons with so much care as Lavinia reads you sweet poetry and Tully’s Orator.
Can't you guess what she wants from you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, I don’t know and I can’t guess. Unless she’s suffering from some fit or madness, for I’ve often heard my grandfather say that extreme grief makes people mad, and I’ve read that Hecuba of Troy went mad from sorrow. That made me afraid—although, my lord, I know my noble aunt loves me as dearly as my mother ever did, and would only in madness have ever frightened me—and I threw down my books and ran, but perhaps for no reason. Forgive me, sweet aunt; and madam, if my uncle Marcus comes with us, I’ll gladly go with you.
Lucius, I will.
What are you doing, Lavinia? Marcus, what does this mean? She wants to see one of these books. Which book? Open them, boy. [To LAVINIA] You’re a better reader than me—come and take any book from my library, and so distract yourself from your sorrow until the heavens reveal who did this to you. Why does she lift her arms up twice?
I think she means that there was more than one who did this; yes, there was more than one. Unless she’s praying to heaven for revenge.
Lucius, which book is she searching through so frantically?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Grandfather, it's Ovid's Metamorphoses; my mother gave it to me.
Perhaps she chose it for love of Lucius's mother.
Look! See how quickly she turns the pages.
What is she looking for? Lavinia, do you want me to read? This is the tragic story of Philomel, who was raped by Tereus—and rape, I fear, was what happened to you.
See, brother, see; look how she's pointing to particular passages.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lavinia, were you attacked, sweet girl, raped as Philomel was in the silent, vast, and gloomy woods? Of course, of course! Yes, there is a place like that, the wood where we hunted—oh, I wish we had never, never hunted there!—just like the one described by Ovid, made by nature for murder and rape.
Oh, why would nature create such a foul place, unless the gods take delight in our suffering?
Give signs, sweet girl, for everyone here is your friend: what Roman lord is responsible? Was it Saturnine—like Tarquin, who left the camp to attack Lucrece?
Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me. May Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury inspire me, so that I can find some way to expose the criminal! My lord, look; look at this, Lavinia. This is a plain plot of sand; if I take this stick, I can write my name without any hands at all. If you can, do what I did.
Curses on the heart that forced us to this method! Write, good niece; and tell us, at last, what God wants to be known so that we can take revenge. Heaven will guide your pen to show what happened, so that we may know the traitors and the truth!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, do you read, my lord, what she’s written? "Rape. Chiron. Demetrius."
What, what! The lustful sons of Tamora did this horrible, bloody crime?
Magni Dominator poli, Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?
Oh, calm yourself, gentle lord—although I know there’s enough written here on the ground to enrage even the mildest person, and make children exclaim with anger. My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel; and kneel, sweet boy, who we hope will grow up to be the Roman Hector. Swear with me—as Lucrece’s father, Lord Junius Brutus, swore after her rape—that we will take mortal revenge on these traitorous Goths. We’ll see them bleed, or we’ll die instead.
Certainly we will, if we can. But if you hunt these bear cubs, then beware; their mother will wake, and if she sees you once, she’ll set the lion on you—for she lulls him to sleep while she plays on her back, and while he sleeps she'll do what she wants. You’re not much of a huntsman, Marcus; leave it alone. And come, I’ll go get a sheet of brass, and with a steel pen I’ll write these words and lay it aside: the angry northern wind will blow these sands through the air like Sibyl’s leaves.[To YOUNG LUCIUS] And what do you have to say for yourself, boy?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I say, my lord, that if I were a man, these slaves wouldn’t be safe in their mother’s bedroom.
Yes, that’s my boy! Your father has often done the same for his ungrateful country.
And so will I, uncle, if I live long enough.
Come, go with me to my armory; Lucius, I’ll fit you with armor, and you’ll go to the empress’s sons dressed like that, carrying presents from me. Come, come—you’ll take the message for me, won’t you?
Yes, by stabbing them in their hearts, grandfather.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, boy, not that; I’ll teach you another way. Lavinia, come. Marcus, take care of my house while I’m gone; Lucius and I will go make a spectacle of ourselves at court. Yes, indeed we will, sir; and they’ll pay attention.
Oh, heavens, can you hear a good man groan, and not stop these sufferings, or take pity on him? Marcus, care for him in his madness, since he now has more scars of sorrow on his heart than marks of the enemy on his battered shield. And yet he’s so attached to justice that he won’t take revenge. So take revenge for old Andronicus, heavens!
Look, Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius—and he's got some message to give us.
Yes, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
My lords, I bring greetings from Andronicus with all the humility I can. [To himself] And I pray the Roman gods punish you both!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thanks, lovely Lucius; what's the news?
[To himself] That we've found you out, that's the news, and know that you're rapists.[To CHIRON and DEMETRIUS] With all respect, my grandfather has sent me to bring you the best weapons from his armory to amuse your honorable youth, for you are the hope of Rome. He told me to tell you that, and so I do. And I present you these gifts, your lordships, so that you can always be armed whenever you need to—and with that, I'll go. [To himself] Armed like murderous villains, that is.
[Looks at weapon] What's this? A scroll tied around? Let's see.[Reads] "Integer vitae, scelerisque purus, / Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu."
Oh, it's a verse by Horace, I know it well; I read it in school a long time ago.
Yes, right, a verse from Horace. You've got it. [To himself] Ha, what an ass! This is no joke—the old man knows that they're guilty, and sends them weapons wrapped with words that wound them, although they don't pick up on it. But if our sly empress were here, she would applaud Andronicus's cleverness. But we'll leave her be for a while, since she's unwell.[To CHIRON and DEMETRIUS] And now, young lords—wasn't it lucky that we came to Rome, since we arrived as foreigners and captives and now have so much power? It pleased me to have a go at Marcus Andronicus at the palace gate in front of his brother.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And I love to see this great lord bow to us and send us gifts.
Doesn't he have reason, Lord Demetrius? Didn't you treat his daughter in a very friendly way?
I wish we had a thousand Roman ladies like that, to take turns serving our lust.
A kind and loving wish.
We just miss your mother to say "amen."
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And she would wish we had twenty thousand more.
Come, let's go and pray to all the gods for your beloved mother in her labor pains.
[To himself] Pray to the devils; the gods have given up on us.
Why do the emperor's trumpets make that sound?
Probably because the emperor has a son.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Look! Who's that?
Good morning, lords; oh, tell me, have you seen Aaron the Moor?
Well, they've seen me more or less, or they never saw me at all—here's Aaron. What do you want with him?
Oh, gentle Aaron, we're all ruined! Help, or we'll be miserable forever!
Why do you scream and cry like that? What's that bundle in your arms?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, something that I would hide from the eye of heaven—the shame of our empress and the disgrace of noble Rome! She is delivered, lords; she's delivered.
To whom?
I mean, she's had a child.
Well, God give her a good rest afterwards! What sort of child has he given her?
A devil.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, then she's the devil's mother; a happy birth.
It's a joyless, sad, and black child: here's the baby, as disgusting as a toad among the fairest ladies of our land. The empress sends it to you—for it looks exactly like you—and orders you to kill it with your dagger.
By God, you whore! Is black so terrible a color?[To the baby] Sweetheart, you are a beautiful flower, you are.
Villain, what have you done?
That which you can't undo.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You have undone our mother.
Villain, I have done your mother.
And in doing that, hellish dog, you've undone her. Oh, let her good luck come to an end, and damn her disgusting choice! Curses on the offspring of such a foul devil!
It shall not live.
It shall not die.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Aaron, it must; the mother orders it.
What, it has to die, nurse? Then let no one but me kill my own flesh and blood.
I'll stab the tadpole with the point of my blade; nurse, give it to me. My sword will soon get rid of it.
Before you do that, this sword will tear out your bowels.
Stop, murderous villains! Will you kill your brother? Now, by the light of the stars that shone so brightly when this boy was conceived, I'll kill whoever touches this child, my first-born son and heir! I tell you, boys, Enceladus and all of Typhon's offspring, or Alcides, or the god of war couldn't take this prey from his father's hands. What, what, you stupid, shallow boys! You white-washed walls! You painted alehouse signs! Coal-black is better than any other color, because it will never bear another hue: all the water in the ocean can never turn the swan's black legs to white, even if she bathed them hourly in the flood. Tell the empress from me that I'm old enough to keep my own child, whatever excuse she must make for it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you betray your noble mistress like this?
My mistress is my mistress; this child is me, the picture of how I was a child. I prefer this to all the world, and despite everything I will keep it safe—or all Rome will burn.
Our mother will be forever shamed by this.
Rome will hate her if this foul thing lives.
The emperor, in his anger, will condemn her to death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I can't stand to think of this humiliation.
Why, that's because you're white: your treacherous color so easily betrays what you're thinking, since you blush so easily! But this young boy has another kind of complexion. Look how the black slave smiles on his father, as if to say "old boy, I'm yours." He's your brother, lords, fed from the same blood that first gave you life, and from the womb where you were imprisoned he has emerged, too, and come to the light. No, he is your brother, certainly, although he looks like me.
Aaron, what should I tell the empress?
Advise us what we should do, Aaron, and we'll take your advice. Save the child so that we can all be safe.
Then let's sit down and think. My son and I will have some space—stay over there. Stay there; now feel free to make a plan.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How many women saw his child?
Ah, see, brave lords! When we're working together, I'm like a lamb; but when you cross me, the boar, the mountain lioness, and the ocean are not so powerful as Aaron in rage. But tell us, again; how many have seen the child?
Cornelia the midwife, me, and no one else but the empress.
The empress, the midwife, and you: two can be silent when the third's gone. Go to the empress and tell her that.
Ha! She cries like a pig prepared to be roasted.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What are you doing, Aaron? Why did you do this?
Oh, Lord, sir, for strategy. Should this babbling gossip live to tell the tale? No, lords, no—and now let me tell you my full plan. One of my countrymen, Muli, lives not too far from here. Yesterday night his wife gave birth to a child like her, as fair-skinned as you. Go to him, give the mother money, and tell them the situation: if they give us their child, it shall become the emperor's heir and take the place of mine, to calm this storm in the court and let the emperor have his son. Listen, lords, you see I have given her medicine—
And you have to take care of the funeral; bury her in the fields nearby, for you're noble gentlemen. Once you're done with that, hurry up and send the midwife to me. Once I've taken care of the midwife and the nurse, then the ladies can gossip all they want.
Aaron, I see you wouldn't trust the air with your secrets.
For this favor to our mother, we're very grateful to you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, swift as a sparrow, I'll go to the Goths, to leave this treasure in my arms and secretly greet the empress's friends.[To the baby] Come on, you thick-lipped slave, I'll take you there, for it's you that's caused all this mess. I'll feed you with berries and roots, and curds and whey. You'll nurse from the goat, and live in a cave, and I'll bring you up to be a great warrior and command a camp.
Come on, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way.[To Young LUCIUS] Sir boy, now let me see your archery; make sure you draw home and shoot straight. Terras Astraea reliquit: remember it. Marcus, justice is gone, she ran away. Sirs, pick up your weapons. You, cousins, will go around the ocean and cast your nets; perhaps you can catch her in the sea. But there’s just as little justice there as on land—so never mind. No, Publius and Sempronius, you must do it; dig with a fork and spade until you get to the center of the Earth. Then, when you get to Pluto’s underworld, give him this petition. Tell him I ask for justice and for help, and that it comes from old Andronicus, who suffers in ungrateful Rome. Oh, Rome! Well, I made you miserable when I threw the people’s votes on the tyrant Saturninus. Go, go away; and be careful everyone, and don't let a ship get by without searching it. This wicked emperor may have had her shipped her away. And then, kinsmen, we're searching for justice in vain.
Oh, Publius, isn’t this distressing, to see your noble uncle so mad?
And for that reason, my lord, we make sure to watch him all day and night, and take care of him as best we can, until perhaps time will heal him.
Kinsmen, his sorrows are past fixing. Join the Goths, and by going to war take revenge on Rome for this ingratitude, and on the traitor Saturnine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Publius, how are you? How are you, my masters? What, have you found her?
No, my good lord; but Pluto says that you will have revenge from hell, if you ask for it. He thinks that Justice is busy with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else, so you need to wait a bit.
It’s wrong to make me wait. I’ll dive into the burning lake in the underworld, and pull her out of Acheron by the heels. Marcus, we’re just shrubs, not cedars, not big-boned men like the cyclops. We’re just metal and steel, Marcus, and yet we’ve had more wrongs done to us than our backs can bear. And, since there’s no justice in earth or hell, we’ll pray to heaven and move the gods to send down Justice to right our wrongs. Come, let’s do it. You are a good archer, Marcus.
"To Jove," that's for you; here, "To Apollo"; "To Mars," that's for me. Here, boy, to Pallas; here, to Mercury; to Saturn; Caius. Not to Saturnine—you might as well shoot against the wind. Get to it, boy! Marcus, let your arrow fly when I tell you. I swear I’ve written to every god for justice.
Kinsmen, shoot all your arrows at the palace; we’ll annoy the prideful emperor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, masters, draw.
Oh, nicely done, Lucius! Good boy, in Virgo's lap; give it to Pallas.
My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon; I've sent your letter to Jupiter.
Ha, ha! Publius, Publius, what have you done? See, see, you've shot off one of Taurus's horns.
This was the game, my lord; when Publius shot his arrow, Taurus butted heads with Aries, and both the ram’s horns fell down into the court. And who should find them but the empress's villain? She laughed, and told the Moor he should give them to the emperor as a present.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, there they go: God give joy to his lordship!
News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come. Man, what do you hear? Do you have any letters for me? Will we have justice? What does Jupiter say?
Oh, the gibbet-maker! He says that he has taken the gibbets down again, for the man won’t be hanged until next week.
But what does Jupiter say, I ask you?
Sorry, sir, I don’t know Jupiter; I’ve never had a drink with him in my life.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But villain, aren't you the messenger?
Yes, I carry pigeons, sir—nothing else.
Why, didn't you come from heaven?
From heaven! Oh, sir, I’ve never been there. God forbid I should barge into heaven when I’m still so young. Why, I’m going with my pigeons to the tribune of the plebs, to deal with a fight between my uncle and one of the emperor’s soldiers.
[To TITUS] Why, sir, this is the perfect messenger for your speech. Let him take the pigeons to the emperor from you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tell me, can you deliver a speech to the emperor with a grace?
No, truly, sir, I've never said grace in my life.
Man, come here; don’t say anything else, but just bring your pigeons to the emperor; you’ll get justice from him, for my sake. Wait, wait; here’s money for your trouble. Give me pen and ink. Man, can you deliver a petition gracefully?
Yes, sir.
Then here is a petition for you. And when you come to him, you must first kneel, then kiss his foot, then give him your pigeons, and then wait for your reward. I'll be close by, sir; make sure you do it well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Leave it to me, sir.
Do you have a knife? Come, give it to me. Here, Marcus, fold it in the letter, for you’ve made it look like a humble petition. And when he’s given it to the emperor, knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
God be with you, sir; I will.
Come, Marcus, let's go. Publius, follow me.
Why, lords, this is an outrage! Has there ever been a Roman emperor oppressed, disobeyed, and troubled like this—and treated with such contempt, simply for enforcing the law? My lords, you and the mighty gods know that whatever these disturbers of the peace say, buzzing like bees in the common people's ears, that what happened to old Andronicus's sons was just and legal. And so what if he's gone crazy? Do we have to deal with the consequences of his fits and bitterness? And now he writes to heaven for justice. See [shows arrows], here's to Jove, and this one's to Mercury; to Apollo, to the god of war . . . and these papers are scattered throughout the streets of Rome! Isn't this libel against the Senate, accusing us of injustice everywhere? Good ammunition, my lords, for those would say there's no justice in Rome. But if I live, his pretended madness won't protect him—he and his family will know that justice lives as long as Saturninus is here, and if she sleeps, he'll wake her and set her on them in fury.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine, lord of my life, commander of my thoughts: calm yourself. Remember that Titus is old; his grief for his sons has pierced him deeply and scarred his heart. Comfort him in his distress instead of prosecuting the greatest or least member of his family for this.  [To herself] Well, it's clever to pretend to defend him like this. But Titus, I've got you, and I've spilled your life-blood. if Aaron's plan goes smoothly, then we're almost there.
Hello, good man! Do you want to speak with us?
Yes, indeed, if you're an imperial lady.
I'm the empress, but the emperor is there.
It's him. God and Saint Stephen give you good evening; I've brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To guards] Go, take him away, and hang him immediately.
How much money do I get?
Go on, man, you must be hanged.
Hanged! By our Lady, then I've come to a good end.
Spiteful and intolerable treatment! How can I endure this monstrous behavior? I know where this came from—can I bear this? He acts as if his traitorous sons, that died lawfully for murdering my brother, have been unjustly killed by me! Go, drag the villain here by his hair; I won't go any easier on him because he's old and honored in battle. For this proud mockery I'll kill him, the crafty, crazy bastard, who helped to give me the throne hoping he could take control of Rome and me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What do you have to report, Aemilius?
Raise an army, my lord—Rome has never been under attack like this before. The Goths have arrived with an army of soldiers intent on sacking the city. They come here under the command of Lucius, old Andronicus's son, who threatens to take as much revenge as Coriolanus ever did.
Fierce warrior Lucius is general of the Goths? This news nips me like a flower covered in frost or grass beaten down with storms. Yes, now our sorrow comes; the common people love him. When I've disguised myself and walked through the streets, I've often heard them say that Lucius was wrongfully banished, and that they wish he were their emperor.
Why should you be afraid? Doesn't the city have strong defenses?
Yes, but the citizens prefer Lucius, and will rebel against me to support him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* King, your thoughts should be as imperial as your name. Is the sun dimmed when gnats fly in it? The eagle doesn't mind when little birds sing, since he knows he can shut them up whenever he wants—so can you with the silly citizens of Rome. Then cheer up, emperor. For I will enchant the old Andronicus with words sweeter and more dangerous than baits to fish or stalks of honeysuckle to sheep, when they're wounded with the bait or poisoned with delicious food.
But he won't beg his son to stop the attack.
If Tamora asks him, then he will. For I can smooth things over and fill his ear with golden promises. Even if his heart were hard as stone and his old ears deaf, both his heart and his ears would obey my words. [To AEMILIUS] You, go ahead of me and be our ambassador. Tell Lucius that the emperor requests a meeting with him at the house of his father, old Andronicus.
Aemilius, take care with this message. If he asks for some proof that we won't harm him, ask him what we can do to show we're in good faith.
I'll deliver the message as well as I can.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now I'll go to old Andronicus and deal with him with all the cunning I have, to get him to bring proud Lucius here from the warrior Goths. And now, sweet emperor, be cheerful again, and don't be afraid, since I'm taking care of it.
Then go now and talk to him.
Faithful friends and proven warriors, I've received letters from Rome telling me how much they hate the emperor and how eagerly they look forward to our arrival. So, great lords who are impatient with the wrongs done to you, however Rome has hurt you, make sure you repay it threefold.
Brave son of great Andronicus—whose name once terrorized us and now comforts us, and whose honorable service to Rome has been badly repaid—you can count on us. We'll go where you lead us, like stinging bees led by the beekeeper to a field of flowers, and take revenge on cursed Tamora.
Everything he says, we say with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I thank him humbly, and I thank all of you, too. But who's that, led by a Goth warrior?
Famous Lucius, I went ahead of the army to see a ruined monastery, and as I looked at the building, I heard a baby cry underneath a wall. I followed the noise to its source, and heard someone shushing the baby by saying, "Be quiet, brown slave, half me and half your mother! The color of your skin betrayed who your father was; if nature had made you look like your mother, you might have been an emperor. But when the bull and cow are both milk-white, they don't breed a coal-black calf. Be quiet, villain, be quiet!"—so he said to the baby—"Since I have to take you to a trustworthy Goth, who, when he knows that you're the empress's child, will take good care of you for your mother's sake." When I heard this, I rushed at him with my weapon drawn, took him prisoner, and bought him here to do with as you see fit.
Oh, many thanks, Goth, for this is the devil incarnate who robbed Andronicus of his good hand. This is the pearl that pleased the eye of your empress, and this child is the fruit of his burning lust. Tell us, slave, what should we do with this growing image of your devil-like face? Why don't you say anything? What, are you deaf? Not a word? Come on, soldiers! Hang him on this tree, and hang the fruit of his adulterous affair next to him.
Don't touch the boy; he is of royal blood.
But he's too like the father to ever be good. First hang the child so he can see it die, which is a sight that will distress a father's soul. Get me a ladder.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lucius, save the child, and bring it to the empress from me. If you do this, I'll show you marvelous things that will be to your advantage to hear. If you don't, whatever happens, I'll say nothing more but "revenge rot you all!"
Say what you have to say: if I'm pleased with what you say, your child will live and I'll see it taken care of.
If it please you! Why, I assure you, Lucius, you'll be enraged when you hear what I have to say, for I'll reveal murders, rapes, and massacres; acts committed under cover of night; horrible deeds; treasonous plots; and villainous deeds which would make you have pity when you hear them, but were performed without pity. And all this will be buried with me when I die, unless you promise to me that my child will live.
Tell what you know. I promise that your child will live.
Swear that he will, and then I'll talk.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What can I swear? You don't believe in any gods; if that's true, then how can you believe an oath?
So what if I don't? Indeed, I don't—but I know you're religious and have a thing called "conscience," and I've seen you perform twenty popish rituals and ceremonies, which you're always careful to observe. So that's why I make you swear, since I know that an idiot treats a toy like a god and keeps the promise he swears by that god. So you will swear by that god—whatever god it is that you worship—to save my boy, take care of him, and raise him, or else I won't tell you anything.
By my god, I swear to you that I will.
The first thing you should know is that his mother is the empress.
Oh, insatiable and lustful woman!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, Lucius, that was a charitable deed compared to what you'll hear from me soon. It was her sons that murdered Bassianus, and they were the ones who raped your sister, cut out her tongue, and cut her hands and trimmed her as you saw.
Oh, horrible villain! You call that trimming?
Why, yes, she was washed and cut and trimmed, and it was good fun for those who did it.
Oh, barbaric animals, just like you!
Indeed, I was the one who told them to do it—they got their cunning from their mother, like a trump card that always wins the match. But their violence, I think, they learned from me, like a dog that goes for the bull's head. Well, my deeds will show what I'm made of. Plotting with the queen and her two sons, I lured your brothers to the hole where Bassianus's dead body lay; I wrote the letter that your father found and hid the gold mentioned in the letter, in league with the queen and her sons. What has happened that made you suffer that I wasn't involved with in some way? I cheated your father out of his hand, and when I had it, I broke down with laughter as soon as I was out of your sight. When he got his two sons' heads in exchange for his hand, I saw his tears from a hiding spot in the wall and laughed so hard that I cried too. When I told the empress this funny story, she almost fainted with pleasure, and as a reward gave me twenty kisses.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, can you say all this and not blush with shame?
Yes, like a black dog, as the saying goes.
Aren't you sorry for these horrible crimes?
Yes, I'm sorry that I didn't do a thousand more. Even now I curse the day—although there haven't been many such days, I admit—when I didn't do some horrible thing like kill a man (or else plot his death), rape a girl (or plot some way to do it), accuse some innocent person, swear, make two friends hate each other, break the neck of poor cattle, or set barns and hay-stacks on fire and tell the owners to put out the flames with their tears. I've often dug up dead men from their graves and set them standing up at the doors of their dear friends—who had begun to get over their grief—and used my knife to write on their skins, as on the bark of trees, "Don't let your sorrow die, although I'm dead." Ha, I've done a thousand awful things as easily as one would kill a fly, and nothing makes me sadder than not being able to do ten thousand more.
Cut the devil down; he doesn't deserve such an easy death as hanging.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If there are devils, I wish I were one, and could live and burn forever in fire—so that I could see you in hell, and continue to torment you with my bitter words!
Sirs, shut him up, and don't let him say anything else.
My lords, a messenger from Rome is here asking to see you.
Let him come in.
Welcome, Aemilius. What's happening in Rome?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lord Lucius and princes of the Goths, the Roman emperor sends his greetings. He understands that you are here with an army, and asks to meet with you at your father's house—if you ask for hostages to ensure your safety, they'll be immediately sent to you.
How does our general respond?
Aemilius, if the emperor gives these promises to my father and my uncle Marcus, we'll come. Let's march away.
So, I’ll go to Titus dressed in this strange costume, and tell him I am Revenge, sent from below to help him right his terrible wrongs. I’ll knock at the door to his study—which is where he spends most of his time, they say, plotting ways to take revenge—and tell him Revenge has come to help him destroy his enemies.
Who’s bothering me? Are you trying to make me open the door, so that I’ll lose my resolve and all my work will come to nothing? You’re wrong if you think that will happen—for I’ve written my plan on this paper in blood, and what is written will be done.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Titus, I've come to talk with you.
No, I won’t hear it. How can I talk, since I lack a hand to accompany my words with appropriate gestures? You’ve gotten the better of me, so don’t say anything else.
If you knew who I was, you'd talk to me.
I’m not crazy; I know who you are. By my poor stump, these lines of blood, these lines of grief on my face, my exhausted days and heavy nights, and all my suffering, I know that you’re our proud empress, mighty Tamora. Have you come for my other hand?
You sad man, I’m not Tamora. She’s your enemy, and I’m your friend. I am Revenge, sent from hell to ease your mind, vulture-like in the way it gnaws at you, by taking bloody vengeance on your enemies. Come down, and welcome me to this world; talk to me about murder and death. There isn’t a hollow cave, secret hideaway, obscure place, or misty valley where they can hide that I won’t find them. I’ll whisper  “Revenge" in their ears, and the criminals will quake with fear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Are you Revenge? And have you been sent to me to torture my enemies?
I am; so come down and welcome me.
Do something for me before I come to you. I see that Rape and Murder stand by your side; to prove that you really are Revenge, stab them or crush them under the wheels of your chariot. Then I’ll come and be your charioteer, and travel with you around the globe. I’ll give you two black horses to pull your wagon of revenge as you find the murderers in their guilty caves; and when the cart is loaded with their heads, I’ll dismount and trot alongside your wheel like a slavish footman all day long, from when the sun rises in the east until it falls into the sea. And I’ll do this hard task every day, if you destroy Rape and Murder there.
These are my agents, and come with me wherever I go.
Are these your agents? What are their names?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They’re called Rape and Murder because they take revenge on rapists and murderers.
Good Lord, they look a lot like the empress’s sons! And you look like the empress! But we mortal men have miserable, mad eyes that are easy to deceive. Oh, sweet Revenge, now I’ll come to you; and, if you can be happy with a one-armed embrace, I’ll embrace you soon.
[To CHIRON and DEMETRIUS] Since he’s crazy, I’ll just keep agreeing with him. Whatever I come up with, just support my story in whatever you say—for now he thinks I’m Revenge. And, since he’ll be easy to deceive now, I’ll make him bring his son Lucius to his house. And during the banquet, I’ll find some cunning way to destroy the Goth army, or at least to make them turn against him. Look, here he comes; I have to keep this up.
I’ve been waiting for you for a long time. Welcome to my sad house, dreaded Fury; Rape and Murder, you’re welcome here, too. You look so much like the empress and her sons! You would look even more like them if you had a Moor with you—couldn’t you find such a devil in hell? For I know that the empress doesn’t go anywhere without a Moor, and if you’re trying to look like her, it would be convenient to have a devil like that. But you’re welcome just as you are. What should we do?
What do you want us to do, Andronicus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
Show me a villain that's raped someone, and I'm here to take revenge on him.
If you show me a thousand people who have wronged you, I'll take revenge on all of them.
Look around the wicked streets of Rome, and when you find a man that looks like you, good Murder, stab him, for he’s a murderer. Go with him, good Rape, and when you find someone who looks like you, stab him, for he’s a rapist.[To TAMORA] Go with them, and in the emperor’s court there’s a queen served by a Moor—you’ll recognize her, since she looks exactly like you. I beg you, give them both a violent death, for they’ve been violent to me and my family.
You’ve told us well; we’ll do it. But wouldn’t it be nice, good Andronicus, to send a message to your brave son Lucius—who is coming towards Rome with an army of Goths—and invite him to come for a banquet at your house? And when he’s here at this feast, I’ll bring the empress and her sons, the emperor himself, and all your enemies. They’ll kneel before you and beg for mercy, and you can do what you want with them. What do you think of this plan?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marcus, my brother! Sad Titus is calling for you.
Go to your nephew Lucius, gentle Marcus, and tell him to come to my house, bringing some of the Goth princes with him. Ask him to leave his army where they are; tell him the emperor and the empress are also coming for a banquet at my house, and he’ll feast with them. Do this out of love for me, and tell him to come out of love and respect for his old father.
I'll do it, and return soon.
Now I’ll go and take revenge for you, bringing my agents with me.
No, no, let Rape and Murder stay with me. Or else I’ll call my brother back again, and I’ll count on Lucius to take revenge for me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To her sons, so that only they can hear] What do you think, boys? Will you stay with him while I go tell my husband the emperor how I’ve handled this new joke? Play along, be nice, and stay with him until I return again.
[To himself] I know who they are, although they think I’m crazy. I’ll beat them at their own game, this pair of cursed hell-dogs and their mother!
Madam, go whenever you want; leave us here.
Goodbye, Andronicus; Revenge is going now to lay a plot against your enemies.
I know you are. Sweet Revenge, goodbye.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tell us, old man, what should we do?
Oh, I have enough work for you to do. Publius, Caius, and Valentine, come here!
What do you want us to do?
Do you know these two?
They're the empress's sons, Chiron and Demetrius.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, Publius, you’re wrong. One is Murder, and the other’s name is Rape. So put them in chains, gentle Publius; restrain them, Caius and Valentine. You’ve often heard me wish for this moment, and now it’s here, so make sure they’re bound tightly. Gag them if they start to cry out.
Stop, villains! We are the empress's sons.
And so we’ll do what we’re told. Gag them, don’t let them speak a word. Is he tightly bound? Make sure they can’t escape.
Come, come, Lavinia; see, your enemies are in chains. Men, stop them from talking, I don’t want to hear it. But I want them to hear every word I say. Oh villains, Chiron and Demetrius! Here is the fountain you’ve stained with mud, the lovely summer you’ve mixed with your winter. You killed her husband, and for that vile crime two of her brothers were condemned to death, and my hand was cut off and made into a joke. You cut off her sweet hands and her tongue. And worse than that, inhuman traitors, you took something from her more precious than hands or tongue—you raped her. What would you say, if I let you speak? Villains, you’d be ashamed to beg for mercy. Listen, miserable criminals! This is how I mean to kill you. I still have one hand left to cut your throats, while Lavinia holds between her stumps the basin that will receive your guilty blood. You know that your mother means to dine with me, and calls herself Revenge, and thinks that I’m crazy. Listen, villains! I’ll grind your bones to dust, and with your blood and that dust I’ll make a paste, and of that paste I’ll make two pies out of your shameful heads. And then I’ll tell that whore, your unholy mother, to eat you and swallow her own children. This is the feast I’ve prepared for her, and this is the food she’ll eat. For you treated my daughter worse than Philomel, and I’ll be revenged worse than Progne. And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,
catch the blood. And when they’re dead, I’ll go grind their bones to a fine powder, and mix it with their hateful blood. And then their vile heads will be baked in that paste. Come, come, everyone do your part in preparing this banquet, which I hope will be more bloody and cruel than the Centaurs' feast. So, now bring them in, for I’ll be the cook, and make sure they’re ready for when their mother comes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Uncle Marcus, since my father wants me to come back to Rome, I’ll do it.
And we're with you, whatever happens.
Good uncle, take this barbaric Moor as your prisoner—he's a hungry tiger, a cursed devil. Don’t feed him, but keep him in chains until he’s brought before the empress, to prove what she’s done. And make sure our army is close by; I’m afraid the emperor plans to betray us.
May some devil whisper curses in my ear and give me the words, so that I can say all the venomous things that are in my heart!
Get away, inhuman dog! Unholy slave! Soldiers, help our uncle take him away.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The trumpets show that the emperor is here.
What, is there more than one sun in the sky?
What's the point of calling yourself a sun?
Rome's emperor, and nephew, stop it; these differences must be discussed quietly. The feast is ready, which Titus has carefully prepared to make peace between you, and to bring love, fellowship, and honor to Rome. So please come and take your places at the table.
Marcus, we will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, mighty queen. Welcome, warrior Goths; welcome Lucius; welcome to everyone. Although the food is modest, it will fill your stomachs, so please eat it.
Why are you dressed like that, Andronicus?
Because I wanted to make sure that everything was perfect for you and your wife.
We're grateful to you, Andronicus.
If you knew what's in my heart, you would be. My lord, give me your opinion on this. Was it a good choice for quick-tempered Virginius to kill his daughter with his own hands, because she had been raped?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It was, Andronicus.
Why do you think so, mighty lord?
Because the girl shouldn't live any longer after having been dishonored, and by staying alive she reminds him of his grief.
You make a strong case and give me a pattern to follow. I'll follow that miserable example. Die, die, Lavinia, and let your shame die with you—
and with that shame, may your father's grief die as well!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who have you done? This is cruel and unnatural!
I've killed the girl who made my eyes blind with tears. I am as miserable as Virginius, and have a thousand times more cause than him to do this horrible thing. And now it's done.
What, was she raped? Tell us who did it.
Will you eat? Will it please your highness to enjoy the food?
Why have you killed your only daughter like this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It wasn't me. It was Chiron and Demetrius; they raped her and cut out her tongue, and so they're responsible for all this.
Go bring them here now.
Why, they're both here, baked in that pie. Their mother has been daintily eating the flesh of her own children. It's true, it's true; I'll prove it with my sharp knife.
Die, madman, for this murder!
Can a son watch his father bleed and do nothing? You'll die for this!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You sad-looking men, people, and sons of Rome—torn apart by conflict, scattered like a flock of birds in the wind—we'll show you how to put this broken body back together again, how to put the scattered corn back into its sheaf. If we don't, Rome will be a curse to herself. The empire that once defeated many mighty kingdoms will, like a pitiful and desperate person shipwrecked on an island, collapse. But if white hair and wrinkles (the signs of experience) can't convince you to listen to me—[To LUCIUS] then speak, Rome's good friend. Speak as eloquently as Aeneas when he told lovesick Dido about the fall of Troy—that destructive, burning night when the Greeks surprised King Priam's city. Tell us what Sinon has betrayed us, or who brought in the Trojan horse that has caused civil war in Rome. My heart isn't made of flint or steel, and I can't talk about all our suffering without crying—so I'll have to stop talking, even when you should listen most closely to what I have to say. Here's your captain: let him explain everything. Your hearts will throb and cry when you hear him.
Then, noble listeners, you should all know that it was Chiron and Demetrius who murdered our emperor's brother and raped our sister. For their foul crimes our brothers were beheaded, and my father's tears were mocked and his hand—the hand which has fought so many battles for Rome and sent her enemies to the grave—cut off as a joke. Lastly, I was unkindly banished from Rome. The gates shut on me and I turned away crying, and went to seek help from Rome's enemies. They drowned their hatred for Rome in my own honest tears and treated me as their friend. I'm the one who was turned away and yet I have saved Rome with my own blood, turning the knife's point away from her and allowing it to pierce my own body. Oh, you know that I'm no boaster; my scars (although they're silent) can prove that what I say is fair and honest. But wait! I think I'm talking too much in praise of myself. Forgive me, for people praise themselves when friends aren't around to do it for them.
Now it's my turn to speak. Look at this child:
This is the son of Tamora and a corrupt Moor, who was responsible for plotting all these crimes. The villain is a prisoner in Titus's house; we've kept him to alive to prove it. Now you see how many reasons Titus had to take revenge—these crimes against him were unspeakable, past endurance, more than any living man could bear. Now that you've heard the truth, what do you say, Romans? Have we done anything we shouldn't have? If we have, tell us so, and the poor remains of the Andronici family will throw ourselves off the walls of our house, hand in hand, and crack our skulls on the stones below. Speak, Romans, speak: if that's what you want us to do, Lucius and I will fall hand in hand.
Come, come, you respected elder of Rome, and take our emperor gently by the hand. I mean our emperor Lucius; for I know that the common people want him to take the throne.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* All hail Lucius, Rome's royal emperor!
Go, go into old Titus's sad house,[To servants] And bring that atheist Moor here, so that we can condemn him to some horrible death as punishment for his evil life.
All hail, Lucius, Rome's gracious governor!
Thanks, gentle Romans; I hope that I'll govern graciously, to heal Rome's wounds and suffering. But, gentle people, give me a moment to mourn my father. Everyone stand aside. But uncle, come closer, to cry with me on this body. Oh, take this warm kiss on your pale cold lips.
These sad drops on your blood-stained face are the last marks of respect and love from your noble son!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your brother Marcus, too, gives you tears and a kiss. If I could give you an infinite number of both, I would!
Come here, son; come, come, and show us how to cry. Your grandfather loved you very much. He would often bounce you on his knee, or sing to you until you fell asleep on his chest; he told you many things that were fit for you to know when you were a child. Like a loving child, then, shed some tears, since kind nature requires it. Friends should be together in times of grief and sorrow. Say goodbye before we bury him. Do that kindness, and then leave him in peace.
Oh, grandfather, grandfather! I wish I were dead, so that you could live again! Oh, God, I can't talk through my tears; they'll choke me if I open my mouth.
You sad family, stop your mourning to pass judgment on the evil man who is responsible for all this suffering.
Bury him up the chest in the ground, and starve him. Let him stand there, and scream, and cry for food; if anyone gives him anything or takes pity on him, they'll die for it. This is my judgment; someone make sure he's buried in the ground.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, why should I be silent when I'm so angry? I'm no baby that will pray and ask forgiveness for the evil things I've done. I'd do ten thousand worse things, if I could. If I ever did one good thing in all my life, I regret it from my very soul.
Loving friends, some of you take the emperor away and bury him in his father's grave. My father and Lavinia will immediately be buried in our family tomb. But as for that vicious tiger, Tamora, there will be no ceremony, no mourners, no bell, no funeral. Throw her body out as prey for beasts and vultures; her life was beast-like and she had no pity, so she won't get any from us. Make sure justice is done on Aaron, that damned Moor, who is responsible for all of this. And after that, I'll reform the government, so that such horrible events won't ever happen again and destroy our country.
This play is set in Troy. The proud princes of the Greek islands, their blood boiling, have sent their ships to Athens, loaded with soldiers and weapons. Sixty nine royal rulers have set sail from Athens towards the Phrygian sea. They have promised to ransack Troy, in the strong walls of which, Helen, the kidnapped wife of Menelaus, sleeps with Paris. This is why the two nations are at war. At first, the Greeks arrived at Tenedos, their over-laden ships unloading their military cargo there. Next the fresh and untested Greeks set up their splendid tents on the fields surrounding Troy.King Priam's city has six gates: the Dardan, Timbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien, and Antenorides, each one is fortified with large beams and bolt-holes: containing the citizens of Troy. A sense of excitement grips both sides, agitating the eager Trojan and Greek soldiers, who are prepared to risk everything in combat. I have come here, as a prologue, to tell you these things, not to brag about my author's talent but dressed appropriately for the story. This play skips past beginnings of the conflict and begins in the middle of it, including in it as much as can be included in a play. Love it or hate it, do whatever you want: in war chance sometimes favors the good and sometimes the bad.
Come here servant, I'll take off my armour again. Why should I go outside Troy's walls to fight, when I have to fight such a cruel battle within them? Every Trojan that still is in control of his heart should go and fight, but I have lost mine!
Will this problem never be solved?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The Greeks are strong, and they are also skillful, fierce, and brave. I am weaker than the sobbing of a woman, more tame than sleep, more foolish than ignorance, less brave than a virgin in the night, and less skilled than untrained infancy itself.
I have given you enough advice on this matter. I will not involve myself any more than I have. If you want to bake a cake you have to be persistent enough to grind the wheat into flour.
Have I not been persistent?
Yes, you've been persistent enough to grind the flour, but you must also be persistent enough to sift the flour.
Have I not been persistent?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, you've sifted the flour, but you must also be patient enough to let the the cake rise.
Even this have I endured.
Yes, up to the rising of the cake. But there is always more to be done, the kneading of the dough, the making of the cake, the heating of the oven, and the baking of the cake itself. You must also wait for the cooling of the cake too, or you may burn your lips.
Patience personified, whatever kind of goddess she is, is able to endure less suffering than me. I sit at King Priam's royal table, but when beautiful Cressida comes into my thoughts... No! "When Cressida comes" is a treacherous phrase. For when is she not in my thoughts?
Well, she was prettier last night than I ever saw her or any other woman look.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I was going to tell you this: my heart felt as if it was being forced apart by a sigh, as if it was going to split in two. But in order that Hector or my father did not see what I was feeling, I disguised my sigh with a smile, like when the sun lights up a storm. But the sorrow that is disguised by the appearance of happiness is just as false as the joy that suddenly turns into sadness.
If Cressida's hair wasn't quite a bit darker than Helen's... well, never mind... she would be in a different league to Helen. But, as for me, she is family to me. I wouldn't want to, as they say, praise her. But I wish someone else had heard her talk yesterday. And I'm not trying to say your sister Cassandra's not clever, but Cressida is even cleverer...
Oh Pandarus! I'm telling you, Pandarus! When I tell you how my hope for success have sunk, do not go on to tell me how deep they are! I tell you I am madly in love with Cressida, and you reply that "she is beautiful". You pour into the open wound of my heart her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her step, her voice, when you talk about them. Oh, that hand of hers, which is so white it makes all other whites seem like ink, ink writing its own failure to be as white as her. Her hand is so soft that it makes a young swan's feathers seem as rough as the hands of a farm laborer. You tell me these things, and no less truly do I say that I love her. Speaking like this you don't heal my wounds with oil and balm, you stick the same knife that made the wounds into every one of them.
I only say what is true.
You can't describe all of her virtues.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Honestly, I will not meddle in your problem anymore. Leave her alone, I say. If she is beautiful, good for her. If she isn't, she can sort it out herself.
Don't be so hasty, good Pandarus!
I have had no reward for my hard work, which makes both you and her think badly of me. I have gone between and between you two, but nothing for my hard work.
Are you angry with me, Pandarus? Surely not with me?
I say she's not as beautiful as Helen out of modesty, because Cressida is family to me. If she weren't my relative, she'd beat Helen any day of the week. But why should I care? I don't care if she is an African, it's all the same to me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Don't I say she is fair?
I don't care if you do or not. She's a fool to wait behind her father. Send her to the Greeks I say, and that's what I'll say to her next time I see her. I'm finished with this whole affair.
Pandarus...
It's nothing to do with me.
Sweet Pandarus...
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I beg you, speak no more about it to me. I will leave you two as I found you, and that's that.
Be quiet, awful noises! Be quiet, unpleasant sounds! Both sides of this war are fools! Helen has to have a beautiful face if her blush is painted on with your blood. I cannot fight for this cause, it is a weak reason for me to draw my sword. But Pandarus... Oh gods, you disturb me! I cannot meet Cressida without Pandarus's help, but he is as difficult to persuade to court Cressida as she is difficult to be courted. Tell me, Apollo, how should I understand Cressida, Pandarus and myself? Cressida's bed is like India, and she is like its jewel. The distance between my home and hers is like a vast ocean, and like a merchant I must invest my wealth in a risky venture, with Pandarus as my ship.
Hello, Prince Troilus! Why haven't you gone to battle?
Because I haven't. I only have a womanly answer like this, and will always be womanly from this moment on. What news has come from the battlefield today, Aeneas?
That Paris has come back with an injury.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who injured him, Aeneas?
Menelaus, Troilus.
Let Paris bleed, it's only a laughable injury when Paris is injured with Menelaus's horn.
Listen, there is good sport outside the city walls today.
There would be sport inside the walls if I had what I wanted. But talking about the sport outside, are you going out to fight?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As quickly as I can.
Come, let's both go.
Who were those people that passed?
Queen Hecuba and Helen.
And where are they going?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They are going to watch the battle from the top of the eastern tower, from where you can see the land outside the city, where the battle is happening. Even Hector, whose patience never fails, was angry today. He scolded Andromache and hit his armorer. Like a farmer, he was prepared to go into the battlefield before the dawn. He went into the field that was wet with dew, and every flower he passed wept, anticipating the lives that he would take.
Why was Hector so angry?
Rumor is that a soldier with Trojan ancestry named Ajax, a nephew of Hector's, has joined the Greek army.
Okay, so why is that a problem?
People say Ajax is an incredible soldier, and stands out.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* All men may stand unless they are sick, drunk or have no legs.
This man is like a mix of beasts, my lady; he is as brave as a lion, as cruel as a bear, and as slow as an elephant. He is a man who has so many characteristics that his bravery has become foolishness, and his foolishness is mixed with some wisdom. There is no virtue that he doesn't have some of, and no flaw that he doesn't carry in some way. He is sad without a reason, and happy when others are sad. He contains something of everything but everything is so confused in him that he is like Briareus whose many hands were useless or Argus whose many eyes were all blind.
But why does this man, who sounds funny to me, make Hector angry?
Rumor is that yesterday he fought Hector and knocked him down. Ever since that, the anger and shame has stopped Hector from eating or sleeping.
Who's coming now?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, that is your uncle Pandarus.
Hector is a brave man.
As brave as any man in the world.
What was that? What was that?
Good morning uncle Pandarus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good morning cousin Cressida, what are you talking about? Good morning Alexander. How are you, cousin? Since when were you in Ilium?
This morning, uncle.
What were you talking about when I arrived? Had Hector woken up and left before you came to Ilium? Helen wasn't awake was she?
Hector has gone, but Helen wasn't awake.
Ah I see, Hector got up early.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That was what we were talking about, that and his anger.
Was he angry?
That's what Alexander told me.
This is true, Hector was angry. I know the reason as well. Hector will attack everyone around him, I can say that. And Troilus will not be far behind him. The Greeks should beware of Troilus, I could say that too.
What? Is Troilus angry as well?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
By Jupiter, you cannot compare the two men.
What? No comparison between Troilus and Hector? Are you not able to recognize a man if you see him.
Yes, if I had seen the front of him and "knew" him.
Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then we agree, because he is certainly not Hector.
You're right he is not Hector, neither does Hector have the same qualities as Troilus in some ways.
This is fair to both of them: they are both themselves.
"Himself!" If only! Poor Troilus, I wish he were himself.
He is himself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As likely as me walking to India without shoes.
He is not Hector.
Himself! No, he's not himself. I wish he would be himself. Oh Gods, time must either help Troilus to recover or end him. Oh, why could my heart not be in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.
Excuse me.
He is older.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pardon?
Troilus hasn't fully come of age. You will have a different view when Troilus he has come of age. By the end of the year Hector will not have the intelligence of Troilus.
Hector will not need Troilus's intelligence, if he has his own.
Hector will not be able to match Troilus's qualities.
It wouldn't matter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Troilus will be the more beautiful.
Hector would look silly, since his beauty is better than Troilus's.
You have no judgement, niece. The other day, Helen herself swore that Troilus, even though he is a little dark, which I have to admit he is, although not really that dark...
No, he has dark skin.
In truth, it is dark but not that dark.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In truth, true and not true.
Helen praised Troilus's complexion more than she praised Paris's complexion.
I see, Paris has a good enough color.
This is true.
Then Troilus has too much colour. If Helen praised Troilus's complexion above Paris, then his complexion is darker than Paris's. Since Paris has just enough color, it is not a compliment to say that Troilus has more color than Paris. I would rather Helen said Troilus had a red nose.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I promise, I think Helen prefers Troilus to Paris.
Then Helen is truly promiscuous.
I am quite sure she does prefer Troilus to Paris. They met in privacy the other day, and you know, he has not more than three or four hairs on his chin.
Even a barmaid could add them up.
That is because he is very young, and yet he can lift as heavy a weight as his brother Hector... give or take three pounds.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is a young man used to carrying other people's things?
But, as proof that Helen loves him, she came and put her white hand on his split chin.
Oh God! Why is it split?
You know full well it has a dimple. I think he smiles better than any man in all of Phrygia.
Oh, he smiles well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Right?
Yes, like a rain cloud in autumn.
Oh shut up, but look, to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus...
If you can make that happen I am sure Troilus will stand happily to see it.
Troilus! Why, Troilus doesn't think better of her than I think of a rotten egg.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you loved rotten eggs as much as you love stupidity, you would eat nothing else.
I have to laugh when I think of how Helen touched Troilus's chin. She has such a beautifully white hand, I must say...
Without any provocation.
And she happens to see a white hair on his chin.
Poor chin, that has less hair than most warts.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It was such a funny sight that Queen Hecuba wept with laughing.
Wept stones.
Cassandra also laughed.
She rarely laughs, did she weep as well?
Hector also laughed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why were these people laughing at all?
Well, at the white hair that Helen had seen on Troilus's chin.
If it was a green hair I might have laughed too.
They weren't laughing at the hair, they laughed at his clever response.
What was his response?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She said: "There are only fifty two hairs on your chin, but one of them is white."
That's what Helen said, not what Troilus said.
True, I don't doubt that. "Fifty two hairs," he said, "and one is white? That white hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.""Jupiter!" she said, "which of these hairs is Paris, my husband?""The split one," he said, "pull it out and give it to him." Oh and there was so much laughter. And Helen blushed, and Paris was so angry, and all the others laughed, and so it ended.
Please let it stay ended, that story took ages.
Right, cousin. I told you something yesterday, think about it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am thinking about it.
It's all true, he will cry after you as if he were a man born in April.
I'll grow in his tears like a nettle during May.
Listen, the soldiers are coming back from the battlefield. Let's stand up here and watch as they pass towards Troy? Be good and join me, Cressida my niece.
I'll do whatever you like.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here, here, this place will do. We will see them well from here. I'll point them all out as they pass, but watch for Troilus in particular.
Don't talk so loudly.
That's Aeneas. Isn't he a brave man? He's one of the best soldiers of Troy, I promise, but wait, Troilus will come soon.
Who's that?
That's Antenor. He is very clever, I promise. He's a good soldier too, an excellent judge, and a noble man. Where's Troilus? I'll point out Troilus soon. If he sees me he'll nod at me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will he give you the nod?
You'll see it.
It will only make you more insufferable.
Look, there, that's Hector, he is a brave man! Go on Hector! He's a brave man, niece. Oh brave Hector! Look at his physique! Look at his face! Isn't he a brave man?
Oh, he is definitely a brave man!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Isn't he? It makes me proud to see him. Look at those gashes on his helmet! Do you see them? You see that, you can't fake those gashes. I'm laying on the praise thick, but if anyone can do better, as they say, let them try. Look at those gashes!
Are they from swords?
Swords or anything else, he wouldn't care if the devil attacked him, he can handle anything. By God, it makes my heart good to look at him. Look, there's Paris.
Look over there niece, isn't he also an impressive man? He is looking strong. Didn't somebody say he was injured today? He's not hurt at all! I am sure Helen will be overjoyed. I wish I could see Troilus. You'll see him soon.
Who's he?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That's Helenus. I wonder where Troilus is. That's Helenus. I'm not sure he went out to fight today. That's Helenus.
Is Helenus a good fighter, uncle?
Helenus? Oh, sure, he fights well enough. I do wonder where Troilus is though. Listen! Can't you hear the people shouting "Troilus?" Helenus is a priest.
Who is that skulking man over there?
Where? Over there? That's Deiphobus. Oh that is Troilus! What a man, niece! Wow! Brave Troilus, a prince of chivalry!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be quiet uncle, you're being embarrassing.
Pay attention, look at him. Oh brave Troilus! Observe him, niece! Do you see how sword is covered in blood, and his helmet has more gashes than Hector's did, and how proudly he walks! Oh what a shining example for young men, and he isn't even twenty three! Go on Troilus, go on! If I had the perfect sister, or a goddess of a daughter, he could choose between them! Oh what a man! Paris? Paris is dirt compared to him. I am sure Helen would give anything to have Troilus instead of Paris.
More soldiers are coming.
Asses, fools, idiots! They are like eating porridge after meat. I would be happy having only seen Troilus. Oh don't look at these men, they are lesser men, like crows instead of eagles. I would rather be Troilus than Agamemnon or any other Greek.
Among the Greeks there is Achilles, who is a better man than Troilus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Achilles! Pah, Achilles is a cart-driver, a servant, a camel of a man.
If you say so.
"If I say so!" What, are you a great judge now? Do you have eyes? Do you have any idea what makes a good man? Is it not parentage, beauty, a good figure, witty conversation, manliness, education, gentleness, strength, youth, generosity, and such virtues that are like spice and salt, the seasoning of a great man?
Ha, that would make an unmanly man, who has all the ingredients except for the most important one.
Ahh! You are like other women, how is any man supposed to understand you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would lie on my back to defend my belly, I would rely on my wit to defend my desires, I would lie secretly to defend my honor, wear a mask to defend my beauty, and beat you down to defend these virtues. I will always guard myself in these ways.
Say one of your prayers for protection.
Don't ask me to talk about protection. I will make sure that you do not betray me by talking, which is one of the most important kinds of protection. If I cannot protect myself from being seduced, I can at least make sure you don't go around telling everyone! Unless it swells past the point where I can hide it, but in that case nothing can be done.
You are an odd one.
Sir, my lord wants to speak to you urgently.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where?
At your house, he is removing his armor there.
Good boy, tell him I am coming.
I fear he will be hurt. Good bye, niece.
Goodbye, uncle.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I shall see you shortly.
Why?
To give you a gift from Troilus.
If you do that you are a pimp.
All these things he does, he does for another man. I see a thousand times more in Troilus than Pandarus can praise, but still I don't admit it. When a man woos a woman he treats her like an angel, and then takes her for granted when he has won her, the happy part is being wooed. Any woman who has been in loved will know this: men value what they haven't had more than is worth. No woman is better off than when a man is trying to please her. I like to use this saying: when a man has a woman he controls her, but until then he must try to please her. Because of this, although in my heart I love him desperately, I shall not show him my love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Princes, what sadness has made you look so pale? All human projects fall short of what they promise to achieve. You should always expect obstacles even in the greatest undertakings. Nor should it come as a surprise that after seven years Troy's walls still stand, since we have been testing many ways of breaking the siege and each has met firm resistance. Why, then, do you great men feel so ashamed of our attempts, and look down like you are failures? Our attempts aren't failures, we are just being tested by Jove, who does not give great men an easy time or else everyone would appear to be a great man. Rather Jove throws great men into a storm and tosses them, so that they can prove their greatness!
With due respect to your office, great Agamemnon, I Nestor shall continue your words. Only dire circumstances prove the greatness of a soldier. After all, anyone is willing to go to sea on a calm day. But if the Gods stir up a great storm, only mighty vessels will sail between the earth and the sky and appear godlike by doing so. The smaller boats are not out in weather like this, are they? No, they flee to their harbors and beg Neptune to show them mercy. Great men aren't encouraged by timid quests, but excel when they are tested by misfortune, their ferocity mirroring the storms they face.
Great Agamemnon, mighty commander and example of Greek strength. We all must give you our opinions. It is proper that we all find strength in your words, although please hear me. As well as praising you both for...
being a mighty and respected king...
You are respected for being so old, and I want to voice my agreement with your speeches. The words you spoke deserved to be held in high esteem by Agamemnon and the leadership of Greece. And similarly, your words should be seen as great wisdom by all Greeks, as you are so wise and knowledgeable, Nestor. But, even so, please listen great man and wise man, to my speech.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You may speak, Ithacan prince. You should know that I am confident you will not speak like Thersites, who is disgusting and harsh in his speech. From you we will hear beauty, intelligence and wisdom.
Troy would have been razed and Hector would be dead if it were not for the following reasons. Military rank has not been respected enough. However many Greeks we send from our camp, we gain no advantage. There are too many empty tents in the camp and too many different factions. Would you expect to get honey from a hive in which the bees are not all working to one common purpose? If the rank has been hidden, the lowest seems not worse than the best. Even the planets show a respect for order, standing in a line before the glorious sun that sits in the best place in the sky. The sun is like a king whose gaze corrects the bad potential of the planets, which would otherwise become disordered. When the planets wander they bring with them plagues, mutinies, tempests, earthquakes, raging storms and other terrifying events. When rank, which is key to all great plans, is not respected, there can be no success. How could any community, from schools or guilds in cities, or ports by the sea, or siblings dividing an inheritance, or any monarchy survive without proper respect for rank? If you ignore rank, it is like you take the instrument of society out of tune, and you are guaranteed a disharmony. Everything will fall out of place, and we will face an apocalypse. There would be lawlessness, where men rule by might alone and morality is ignored. Justice would be lost as the powerful do as they please, and chaos, like an all-consuming wolf, would turn all humanity into its prey. If proper respect for rank is ignored, great Agamemnon, then this chaos must follow. A lack of respect for rank can spread from the top to the bottom of an army. First the second-in-command loses respect for his general, then his men lose respect for him, and their men for them as they learn to disrespect duty from their masters. A lack of respect grows like a great sickness of envy, and it is this sickness that keeps Troy from falling to us, not Troy's own strength. Troy is still standing, not because of its strength, but because of our weakness.
Ulysses has very wisely revealed the cause of our weakness.
If this is our sickness, Ulysses, what is our cure?
Achilles, who is considered our best soldier, has been made complacent by his fame, and sits in his tent refusing to aid our plans. He lies there all day with Patroclus laughing disobediently, and Patroclus impersonates us in the most rude way. Sometimes, great Agamemnon, he pretends to be you. Like a prancing actor, who loves nothing more than the sound of his own voice, and with none of your genius, he mimics your greatness pitiably and poorly. He speaks ridiculously, like a bad actor on the stage. Lying on his bed, the great Achilles laughs heartily at this ridiculous impersonation, and says: "Excellent, this is just like Agamemnon. Now pretend to be Nestor, say ahem and stroke your beard, and dress like you were going to speak to the king." When Patroclus does this, even though he gets the part totally wrong, the god-like Achilles shouts out "Excellent, this is just like Nestor. Now, Patroclus, pretend to be Nestor if he thinks we are being ambushed at night." With this instruction, your old age is made fun of, and Patroclus pretends to cough, spit, fumble like an old man, and shake with fear. At this depiction Sir Valor cannot control his laughter, saying: "Oh, that is enough, Patroclus. My ribs ache from laughing, and if I laugh anymore I will split in two from it." And in this way all of our abilities, strengths, appearances, general and specific parts of our character, our achievements, plans, orders, commandments, eagerness for battle or discussion of peace is mocked by those two.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By these two men's mockery, two men who you rightly say are perceived to be our best soldiers, are many other soldiers infected. Ajax refuses to follow orders, and, having grown as proud as Achilles, also refuses to leave his tent. He makes the same slanders as Achilles, speaks poorly of our chances as if he was an oracle. And he has Thersites, a slave who produces slanders like a mint makes coins, mimic us with cheap comparisons, and leaves us undefended.
They say our careful planning is only done to avoid fighting, they say we do not show any wisdom in how we fight this war, ignore our plans, and say that nothing but swordsmanship is worthy of men. Whilst we consider our army's numbers, tactics, timing, and enemies, they say that this has no dignity at all. They call us armchair generals. It is like saying that the battering ram, because it hits hard, deserves all the credit, and refusing to acknowledge the engineer who created it or the commander who deployed it.
If this is how they behave Achilles's horse is worth much more than him.
What? A trumpet? Look Menelaus.
Men are coming from Troy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why are you stood before our tent?
Please tell me, is this mighty Agamemnon's tent?
It is.
May I, as a messenger and as a prince, deliver a message to the king?
You certainly may. Announce your message before the Greek commanders loyal to Agamemnon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You are kind and generous. How should I know which of these men are the princes?
What?
Yes, I ask so that I may show them proper respect and work out in advance who to treat with blushing respect: who is the divine king? Who is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
This Trojan either mocks us, or the Trojans are very polite courtiers.
As ambassadors we are polite, courteous, and as friendly as bowing angels, this is how we are known in peace-times. However, as soldiers, Trojans are strong willed, able-bodied, capable, and skilled with swords, and, by Jove, show no love or mercy. But I should not talk like this, it is immodest to praise yourself. The only worthy praise comes reluctantly from our enemies.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, Trojan, are you Aeneas?
Yes, Greek, that is my name.
Why are you here?
Sir, I may not say, I must speak only to Agamemnon.
No news arrives from Troy that he does not hear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do not come to whisper privately with him, rather I will wake him with my trumpet, and then I will speak to him.
Speak then. Agamemnon isn't asleep, in fact he is telling you this himself.
Be loud trumpet. Wake the Greek tents, so that any worthy Greek might know what the Trojan king would say.
In Troy, great Agamemnon, there is a prince called Hector, the son of Priam, who is growing rusty in this long truce. He told me to take this trumpet and to say this: "Kings, princes, lords! If there is anyone among the best of the Greeks who values his honor more than an easy life, who seeks glory more than he fears death, that is is brave and unafraid, who is willing to actually defend his mistress's honor rather than merely promise to do so, and will fight for her, I have this challenge for such a man. Hector, in front of both Trojans and Greeks, shall prove that he has a wiser, more beautiful, and more truer lady than any Greek has ever had. Tomorrow he will sound this trumpet as he stands halfway between your tents and our walls, hoping to wake a chivalrous Greek. If any Greek like this comes, Hector shall fight him honorably. If no such many comes, when he returns to Troy he shall say that Grecian women are sunburned and worthless." This is his message.
Our soldiers in love shall be told this, lord Aeneas. If none of them are brave enough to come forward, we must have left the brave Greeks at home. But listen, we are soldiers, and a soldier is worthless if he is not in love! If one of them accepts your challenge he will meet Hector. If none will, I will volunteer myself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Deliver him a message from Nestor, who was a man when Hector's grandfather was being breast-fed. He is old now but if there is not one man in the Greek army whose heart is filled with the passion to fight for his love, tell Hector from me that I will hide my white beard in a golden helmet and in my armor hide these withered muscles, and when I meet him I will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandmother and as chaste as anyone in the world. I'll challenge him in his prime with the little life that is left to me.
Heaven forbid such a lack of young, eager men.
Amen.
Fair lord Aeneas, give me your hand, that I may guide you to my tent. Achilles will hear about this challenge, as will every Greek lord. You must feast with us before you go, and be the guest of your worthy enemy.
Nestor!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What are you thinking, Ulysses?
I've just had an idea, help me to develop it.
What is it?
It is this, the pride that has grown hugely in Achilles must be dealt with now. If we ignore it, it will cause lots of problems and ruin us all.
I agree, but how?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Although the brave, young Hector offered this challenge to everyone he intended it only for Achilles.
That is so obvious it may as well have been said in the message. Even if Achilles was a moron - and lord knows he is not very clever - he will quickly figure out that Hector's purpose is to engage him.
And do you think he will rise to the challenge?
Yes, it is almost certain, who else could possibly defeat Hector apart from Achilles? Although it is not a major battle much honor hangs in the balance, as the Trojans will send their best against ours, our ability shall be greatly judged. Victory, although the fight is only between two men, shall reflect either for better or for worse upon the whole army. And this small demonstration shall be used to predict future battles and even the war as a whole. We must assume that the person who meets Hector is our choice, and they will only deserve selection if they are our very best, because the victorious side would gain such a boost to their morale. Bolstered by strong morale, soldiers fight better and harder, like their weapons are extensions of their arms.
Allow me to suggest something: it is because of what you have said that Achilles should not meet Hector. Let us, like merchants, show our worst merchandise in the hope that that it will sell. If it doesn't sell, our best will seem even better when it is compared to the first. Do not allow Hector and Achilles to fight. Both our victory and defeat will be determined by the two strange followers of this fight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do not know who these strange followers are, what are you talking about?
If Achilles were not so proud, the glory he would take from defeating Hector would be shared between us all. But he is too insolent already, and we would suffer his pride and scorn if he defeats Hector. If he were beaten, then our reputation would be crushed alongside our best soldier. No, I think we should hold a lottery and make sure that by some underhand method the brutish Ajax has the ticket to fight Hector. We and the other generals should all pretend that Ajax is the best soldier we have. This will cure our other champion of his pride, Achilles is too used to being praised and it is time for him to feel passed over. If the idiot Ajax wins, we'll praise him as our greatest hero, and if he doesn't succeed we will say we still have better soldiers. But either way our main victory will be having Ajax humble Achilles.
Ulysses, I am starting to appreciate your plan. I'll go and tell Agamemnon about it. Let's go there together immediately. We'll have our two troublesome dogs solve each other, their pride will be the bone that the two dogs fight over.
Thersites!
What if Agamemnon had boils  all over him?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thersites!
If those pus-filled boils ran would that not mean that the general was running? Wouldn't that be a sight.
You dog!
If that happened we might finally see something meaningful coming from him.
You son of a bitch, are you ignoring me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you won't listen to me, I'll beat my meaning into you.
Curse you, you thick mongrel of a lord.
If you talk, you rotten yeast, I will beat you back into shape.
It would be easier for me to talk you into being clever and righteous, but it's more likely your horse will deliver a speech that you will be able to recite a prayer by heart. You can hit things can you? A plague on your pathetic actions.
Toadstool, tell me what the proclamation says.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do you think I have no feelings? Is that why you hit me like this?
Read the proclamation!
You are proclaimed to be a fool, I think.
Do not push me, little satirist, my hands are itching to beat you again.
I wish you itched from head to toe and that it was my job to scratch you, I'd scratch you until you were the most disgusting scab in Greece. When you are actually out in the battlefield you are no quicker to engage than anyone else.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am telling you, read the proclamation!
You spend all day insulting Achilles, yet you only bark at him out of jealousy.
Mistress Thersites.
You should hit Achilles.
Worthless creature!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He would pound you into pieces with his fists, just like a sailor breaking a biscuit.
[Beating Thersites] You son of a whore!
Oh go ahead.
You toadstool!
Go on, you brutish lump. You have less intellect in your head than I have in my elbows. A small donkey is brighter than you, you mock-brave ass! You are only here to beat Trojans, traded like a slave by brighter men than you. Hit me again and I'll tell you exactly what you're worth, you gutless wretch, from bottom to top.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You dog!
You worthless lord!
[Beating him] You worthless creature!
Brainless brawler, go ahead idiot, go on, you camel, go on.
Woah there, Ajax! Why are you hitting him? Why, Thersites, what is wrong?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You see that man, yes?
Yes, what is the problem.
Look at him.
I am, what is the problem?
No, really look at him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, I am looking at him.
You can't look well upon him, for he is Ajax.
I know that, fool.
Yes well the fool does not know himself.
Which is why I hit you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh look here, what small pieces of wit come out of his mouth! He has the wit of a donkey. I have made him look like a fool more than he has beaten me physically. If I buy nine sparrows for a penny I could not buy a ninth of a sparrow with all his wit. This man Ajax, Achilles, has no thoughts beyond basic impulses. I'll tell you what I think of him.
What do you think of him?
I think this Ajax...
Be gentle, good Ajax.
Has not got enough wit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Leave it Thersites.
To fill the eye of Helen's needle, who is the only reason he was brought here.
Be silent, fool.
I would happily live in peace and quiet, but the fool will not, he is the fool, look at him.
Oh you cursed wretch! I shall...
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you set your wit against that of a fool?
I doubt he will, because my wit will make him look stupid again.
Good one, Thersites.
Why are you arguing?
I asked the stupid creature to tell me what the proclamation said, and he started insulting me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am not your servant.
Well then, go away, begone.
I serve in the army as a volunteer.
You last task wasn't voluntary it was forced upon you, no one chooses to be beaten up. Ajax volunteered for his role, you were forced into yours.
Even so. If most of your intelligence does not reside in your muscles, then people were lying about you. If Hector cracks open either of your heads it would be like cracking open a nut to find nothing inside
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Are you mocking me too now, Thersites?
Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy by the time your grandfathers had toenails, are still able to get you two to be like ploughmen for their wars.
Pardon?
Oh yes, hya Achilles, hya hya Ajax.
I shall cut out your tongue.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It doesn't matter, afterwards I'll still speak as much sense as you.
Okay stop now Thersites, be silent.
I'll be silent on the orders of Achilles's bitch, shall I?
That's what you get for helping him, Patroclus.
I'll never come to your tent again unless it is to see you thickheads hanged. I will go where there is more wit and leave you fools behind.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good riddance.
Indeed, Ajax this is what was proclaimed through our camp: Hector, five hours after sunrise tomorrow, will come with a trumpet to the ground between our tents and Troy and call out to fight him any knights who are brave enough, and whoever dares... whatever, it doesn't matter, the whole thing is trash. Goodbye.
Goodbye, who shall fight him?
I don't know, it will be a matter of chance, otherwise his opponent would be obvious.
Oh, you mean yourself. I will go find out more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Even after all the time, lives, and messages that have gone by Nestor still sends the message from the Greeks: "Deliver Helen, and all other damage, all honor, wasted time, effort, money, wounds, friends, and whatever else that is wasted in this war, shall be forgotten." Hector, what do you think of this?
Although no one is less afraid of the Greeks than I am regarding the chance of being killed, yet, powerful Priam, there is no compassionate or concerned woman more eager to cry out "How will this end?" than I am. Peace is dangerous because it makes us complacent in our security. A little doubt is known as the beacon of the wise, it is like a surgical probe that searches a wound. Let Helen leave, since we first begun this battle, every sacrificed soul, each of the many thousands, has been as important as Helen's. I mean the souls of our soldiers, not the Greeks. If we have lost so many men guarding something that is not Trojan nor worth as much to us a Trojan life, why shouldn't we just hand her over?
Away, away, brother! Do you value the king's honor as lowly as common soldier's lives? Are you going to try to count out his infinite worth with the worthless lives of soldiers? Are you going to let down the infinite respect he is due for petty concerns and fears? Away, this shame is unbearable!
It is no wonder you are so dismissive of concern and reason, you are empty of such things. Shouldn't our father rely on reasons to make his judgments, seeing as you have nothing reasonable to say?
You only care about dreaming and sleeping, priest and brother of mine. You invent reasons for living comfortably. Here are those reasons: You know an enemy wants to hurt you, you know fighting them is risky, and that logically you should avoid being hurt. Who is surprised then that when Helenus sees a Greek with a sword, he uses reason as an excuse to run away like a shooting star or Mercury the messenger god away from Jupiter? No, if we only care about logic let's close the gates and go to sleep. Brave and honorable people would live in fear if they allowed reason to govern them. Reason and logic make men into impotent cowards.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Brother, Helen is not worth the price of keeping her.
What is anything worth except what we decide it is?
But value isn't decided by one man's will, value exists in the object as well as the person who desires it. It is mad idolatry to give more in sacrifice than the god is worth, and the desire that is too strong is like a sickness when it cannot see the object's true worth.
If I get married today, my choice was decided by my will. My will is kindled by my eyes and ears, which are like sea-captains navigating a narrow passage between the two dangerous shores of desire and good judgement. How could I choose as a wife anyone other than the person I desired? There is no honorable way to turn away from choosing the person you desire once you desire them. We don't return silks to the merchant we bought them from once we have made them dirty, nor do we throw away our food stores when we are full. We all thought it was appropriate that Paris takes revenge upon the Greeks, your voices were like a wind of consent that blew his ship to Greece, the seas and winds even helped him on his way. He got to his destination, and because the Greeks held one of his old aunts captive, he stole the Greek queen, who is more youthful than Apollo and who makes the morning seem old. Why do we keep her? Because the Greeks keep our aunt. Is Helen worth keeping? She a pearl, so valuable that the Greeks launched over a thousand ships to get her back, making settled kings into merchants who would risk everything on the water. If you admit that it was wise Paris went, which you must because you all told him to go; if you admit he brought home a prize worth having, which you must because you all clapped and called his prize unbelievable; why do you now question what you once thought was wise, and do something never before done, question the value of something that was once worth more than the world? Oh it was a stupid theft if we stole something we are too afraid to keep! Even more ridiculous, we are thieves unworthy of such a thing, that are willing to disgrace the Greeks in Greece, but are afraid of our treasure when we are back home.
[Speaking offstage] Cry, Trojans, cry!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is that noise? Who is screaming?
It is our mad sister, I recognize her voice.
[Speaking offstage] Cry, Trojans!
It is Cassandra.
Cry, Trojans, cry! Give me ten thousand eyes, and I will have them all weep for what will happen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be quiet, sister, calm down!
Virgins and boys, the middle-aged and the wrinkled elderly, young children that can do nothing but cry, join me in moaning! Let us begin early to pay off the debt of tears we will have. Cry, Trojans, cry! Get your eyes used to tears! Troy will be destroyed, and Ilium will fall. Our hot-headed brother Paris will be the ruin of us all. Cry Trojans, cry! Cry because of Helen and misery! Troy will burn if Helen is not let go.
Now, young Troilus, do our sister's prophecies not make you doubt yourself? Or are you so madly excited that no amount of reason, nor fear of defeat or moral wrong-doing, can make you change your mind?
Brother Hector, we mustn't decide what is right or wrong only from the results nor stop being brave just because Cassandra is mad. Her unhinged prophecies don't change the morality of a cause that we all fighting for properly. Personally, I am no more passionate than any of Priam's sons, and God forbid we would fight for anything that any of us are too afraid to fight for and win!
Otherwise the world will think your wisdom and my actions were worthless, but I swear that it was your agreement that made me hurry to ignore my fears and embark on my dangerous task. I couldn't have done all this on my own. How could I have started this war on my own? Yet even without your support if I had as much strength as I have will power I wouldn't do anything differently and would continue the war.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Paris you are speaking like a man who is drunk on their delight. You have the sweetness of Helen, and these men have the bitterness of war, so it is hardly brave of you to want to continue.
Sir, I'm not only concerned with the pleasures I take from her beauty, but would rather our actions be proved honorable by us keeping her. It would be a kind of treason to Helen, disgraceful for you all, and shameful for me, to give her up because of shameful obligation! Surely such cowardly thoughts would never enter your gracious minds? There is no creature so pathetic on our side that they do not have the heart or sword to defend Helen, nor is there anyone so worthy that they would be shamed by dying for Helen. I say it is a proper thing to fight for someone who is without comparison throughout the world.
Paris and Troilus you have both given good speeches even if they were superficial, like the young men who Aristotle thought were unfit to be part of moral debates. The reasons you give are full of passion rather than an unbiased decision between right and wrong, after all pleasure and revenge are deaf, like a snake is, to logic. Nature demands that all debts are settled, and what debt could be greater than a wife being kept from her husband? If natural law is upset by a man's lust, and great minds resist natural law because of their weak will, there are laws in each nation to stop those whose appetites cannot be controlled. If Helen is the wife of Menelaus, as we all know she is, the moral laws of nature and society say that she must be returned. To continue doing an immoral act does not make it better but worse. This is my honest opinion, but nonetheless, my youthful brothers, I feel like agreeing that we keep Helen, because it would reflect so badly on us if we did not.
That's exactly what I was trying to say, if there was no glory in carrying on the fight I wouldn't want another drop of Trojan blood to be spilled in her defense. But, worthy Hector, she is a legendary prize, proof of our excellence and bravery, and if we are courageous enough to defeat our enemies we will become famous heroes. I presume brave Hector would not give up this promise of fame for all the wealth in the world.
I will help you, brave son of Priam. I have sent a rousing challenge to the slow and in-fighting Greek nobility that will rouse them. I was told that their great champion, Achilles, refused to fight, whilst the others sought to imitate him. I presume that my challenge will wake him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh Thersites! What, are you stuck in a maze of your own hate? Will the elephant Ajax win over you like this? He hits me and I insult him, oh that's a worthy payback! I wish it were the other way around, and I could hit him whilst he shouted at me. God's foot, if I have to learn magic and how to conjure demons I will do it, to make my hatred productive. Then there's Achilles, a strange sapper. If Troy isn't taken by these two, it won't be until the walls fall over on their own. Oh Jupiter give up your thunderbolts, and Mercury give up your medicine, if you don't take the last of Ajax and Achilles' pathetic wit from them. Those stupid creatures couldn't think of a way of saving a fly from a spider without drawing their swords and cutting the web apart. After these two, I'd put a plague on the whole camp! Or I'd make their bones ache, a suitable curse for those that go to war over a woman. I have said my prayers and now only need the devil of Envy to agree. What's this, my lord Achilles.
Who's there? Thersites! Oh good, come in and start complaining.
If my memory was able to remember a gilded fake you would not have left my prayers: but it's not important. Be true to yourself! May you be kept wealthy by the common failings of mankind, stupidity and ignorance. May the gods give you the wisdom of a tutor, and you never experience punishment. Be guided by your passions until you die, and if the woman who prepares your body when you die calls you beautiful, then I was a liar and swore that she never prepared anyone who wasn't a leper. Amen. Where's Achilles?
What, are you devout? Were you praying?
Yes, may the heavens hear me!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who's there?
Thersites, my lord.
Where, where? Have you arrived? Oh, my entertainment, my comedian whilst I eat, why haven't you performed whilst I eat for so long? Come on then, what is Agamemnon like?
He is your commander, Achilles. Now tell me, Patroclus, what's Achilles?
He is your lord, Thersites. Now tell me, please, what are you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am the one who understands you, Patroclus. Now tell me, Patroclus, what are you?
You can tell me if you know me.
Tell him, tell him.
I'll begin from the beginning. Agamemnon commands Achilles, Achilles is my lord, I am Patroclus's knower, and Patroclus is a fool.
You rascal!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be quiet, fool! I am not finished.
He is allowed to speak. Go on, Thersites.
Agamemnon is a fool, Achilles is a fool, Thersites is a fool, and as I have already said, Patroclus is a fool.
How did you figure this out, then?
Agamemnon is a fool to try and command Achilles. Achilles is a fool because he is commanded by Agamemnon. Thersites is a fool because he serves such a fool. And Patroclus is definitely a fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why am I a fool?
Ask God, who will be your judge. It is enough for me that you are. Who is coming here?
Patroclus I do not want to speak to anyone, come into the tent Thersites.
These are good tricks and traps. My argument was a baseless show, a clever argument that will make these men argue and fight to the death. Now, a plague on the subject! Let war and greed ensnare everyone!
Where is Achilles?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He's in the tent, but he's ill, my lord.
Let him know we are here. He has shamefully turned away our messengers, and we are willing to forget our rank by visiting him. Tell him this so that he does not think we aren't willing to pull rank on him or that we do not know our power.
I will tell him this.
We saw him at the entrance of his tent so he can't be sick.
He's got the sickness of a lion, he's sick from pride. If you want to make him feel better call it sadness. But I know it is pride. But why is he proud? Let him show us a reason for his pride. A word with you, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why is Ajax so angry at Achilles?
Achilles has taken his fool from him.
Who do you mean, Thersites?
Yes.
Ajax probably has nothing to think about, without Thersites to argue with.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, the fool takes his argument from his keeper. So now Achilles has become Thersites's argument.
This is good, their division is better to us than their alliance. It must have been a strong bond that a fool could break up.
A friendship that isn't wise can be easily broken by folly. Patroclus is coming back.
Without Achilles.
The elephant has joints but no knees to bow with, its legs are only for walking, not for showing respect.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Achilles asked me to say that he is very sorry if you had any serious business to come all this way to him. He hopes you only came this way as part of a leisurely walk after dinner.
Listen, Patroclus, we know these responses very well. But his desire to avoid us, sent with such scorn, can't escape our notice. He has a great reputation, and it is well deserved, but all his virtues begin to seem less impressive to us if he does nothing, just as fresh fruit placed in a rotten meal won't be eaten. Go and tell him we want to speak to him, and don't be afraid to tell him we think he has grown too proud and dishonest. He thinks he is better than he is. Tell him that while he acts aloof a better man is waiting outside, a man who is pretending not to be a divine king, a man who is willingly waiting for him to get off his high horse. I am watching his sulking and pathetic self-assured demeanor. Go, and tell him these things, and say that if he thinks too much of himself we will not see him, but rather we will let him lie here like a siege engine without wheels and place a note outside his tent: "Unless the fighting comes here, this engine cannot go to war, we would rather take an active dwarf than a sleeping giant." Tell him this.
I will, and I will tell you what he says as soon as possible.
I don't want to speak to a middle man, we will come in too. Ulysses, go in.
Is he better than anyone else?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He thinks he is.
And is he as good as he thinks he is? Do you think he thinks he is better than me?
Undoubtedly.
Do you agree with him, and think he is better than me?
No, noble Ajax, you are as strong, valiant, wise, noble, and more gentle than he, and much more easily ordered to do things.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why is anyone proud? Where does pride come from? I don't even know what pride is.
Your smarter and more virtuous for being that way, Ajax, proud men tarnish themselves. Pride is like a mirror to itself, its own trumpet, and its own biography. Anything that honors itself except by acting well ruins the action.
I hate proud men as much as I hate the reproduction of toads.
[Aside] Yet he is a proud man, what does that imply?
Achilles will not fight tomorrow.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What's his excuse?
He doesn't have one, but carries on acting as he has been without respect for anyone else, solely on his own authority.
Why won't he, when we have so politely asked him, leave his tent and talk with us?
He pretends trivial requests are important, purely because they are asked of him. He is so certain of his greatness he is not even satisfied with his own praises of himself, his sense of self worth has such a grip on him that the mental landscape of Achilles is in a state of civil war. What else is there to say? He is so sickeningly proud that his symptoms cry out: "No recovery is possible."
Let Ajax go to see him. Dear lord, go and greet him in his tent, it is said that he respects you, and will at your request be persuaded to make some small change in his behaviour.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh Agamemnon, don't let that happen! We should treasure every step that Ajax takes away from Achilles. The proud lord that stews in his arrogant pride and is incapable of thinking about anyone other than himself shouldn't be given the honor of a visit from a man we worship more than himself. No this very worthy and truly valiant lord must not have his deserved honor sullied. Nor would I want to see his merit, that is as great as Achilles's, treated as worse by making him go to Achilles. That would be like pumping up his already massive ego or throwing fuel into a mid-summer sun of pride. That Ajax should go to him? May Jupiter forbid it and shout down with thunder "Achilles go him."
[Aside to DIOMEDES] Oh this is excellent, Ulysses is playing Ajax perfectly.
[Aside to NESTOR] Look at how he silently enjoys this applause.
If I go to him, I'll smash him in the face with my armored fist.
Oh no, you mustn't go in.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If he is proud to me, I'll sort his pride out. Let me go to him.
Not for all the honor of defeating Troy.
He is a small, insolent man.
[Aside] Ajax could be describing himself!
Is it so much for him to come out?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] The pot is calling the kettle black.
I'll spill his arrogant blood.
[Aside] He should be the patient, but wants to be the doctor.
If all men thought like me...
[Aside] Being witty would no longer be in fashion.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He should eat swords before he acts like this. Will pride be allowed to win?
[Aside] If it was allowed to win it'd half be your fault.
[Aside] He would have ten portions of pride.
I will pound him like bread, I'll make him give in.
[Aside] He's not ambitious enough yet, stuff him with more praise, go, go, he's not ready.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To AGAMEMNON] My lord you let Achilles's snubbing of you play too heavily on your mind.
Noble general, do not think about it.
You must prepare for the battle with Hector without Achilles.
Saying Achilles's name is upsetting Agamemnon. Here is a man who could be our champion... but I should not discuss this whilst he is here, I will be silent.
Why shouldn't you speak of it? Ajax isn't as proud as Achilles is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But the whole world knows he is as brave.
That son of a bitch, how dare he swindle us like this? I wish he were a Trojan.
How terrible would it be if Ajax now...
If he were proud...
Or sought after praise...
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, or if he was aloof...
Or refused to be sociable.
Thank heavens, lord Ajax, that you are such a great man, and may the gods bless your father and mother! Your education must have been magnificent, but no education could teach you to be as great as you naturally are. The man who taught you to fight should be blessed by Mars, even the mighty athlete Milo  seems weak next to Ajax. I cannot praise the wisdom which disciplines your body, but might compare it to Nestor, who is so old that must be wise. I'm sorry father Nestor, but I think if you were as young as Ajax, your natural wit would not exceed his, but would be its equal.
Will you be my father and mentor?
Yes, my good son.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Follow his directions, lord Ajax.
We shouldn't wait around here, the unsociable Achilles won't come into the open. If it pleases our great general we should call together the war council as more Greek kings have arrived to help us. Tomorrow morning we should assemble the men on the field of battle. Even if all of the knights in the world came here, and we had our choice of them all, Ajax will perform best.
Let's go to the council. Let Achilles sleep, he will only weigh us down.
You there, friend! I wish to speak with you, aren't you follower of the young lord Paris?
Yes, sir, I follow him when he walks in front of me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He provides your livelihood, I mean?
Sir, I am provided for by the lord.
You are provided for by a noble gentleman, who deserves praise.
The lord be praised.
You know who I am, right?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Honestly, sir, only vaguely.
Friend, we should know each other better. I am the lord Pandarus.
I hope we can be better friends.
I hope so.
Are you in a state of grace?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A grace? No, friend, I am called 'your honor' and am only a lord.
What is this music?
I only partly know, sir, but the music has many parts.
Do you know the musicians?
Yes, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who are they playing for?
They are playing to the people that are listening, sir.
For whose pleasure, friend?
Well it pleases me, sir, and anyone else that loves music.
Not "pleasure," I meant "command," friend.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who will I command, sir?
Friend, this conversation isn't working, my language is too courtly and you are too quick-witted. Who has asked these people to play?
That's it, sir. To tell you the truth, sir, they play because Paris asked them to. He's there listening to them now. With him, the human Venus, the real expression of ideal beauty, love itself...
You mean my cousin Cressida?
No, sir, I mean Helen. Could you not tell by my description?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You've clearly not seen Lady Cressida, man. I am here to speak with Paris on behalf of Prince Troilus, I will go on a charm offensive as my business with him is boiling hot.
Is your business wet? Your language itself is over-cooked.
I hope you and your companions are all well, my lord! I hope you are are not troubled by your thoughts, especially you beautiful queen, may you rest easily.
Good sir, you speak very kindly.
You speak well, sweet queen. Sweet prince, I like the pieces of this music.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well it is in pieces, cousin, now that you have broken it up. I swear it shall be up to you to make it whole again with a piece of performance of your own. My love, he is full of sweet sounds.
Honestly, my lady, I'm not.
Oh, but sir do sing for us...
Honestly, I am a very bad singer.
You speak well, my lord, speaking with such a rhythm.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have business with Paris, dear queen. My lord could I have a word with you?
No, you won't come between us in this way. You owe me a song for sure!
Sweet queen, you are trying to wind me up aren't you? But listen to this, lord Paris, your brother Troilus, my lord and most esteemed friend...
My lord Pandarus, sweet lord...
Please, sweet queen, shhh... (Troilus) wanted you to know that he is very fond of you (Paris)...
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You won't cheat me out of a song. If you do I shan't forgive you!
Sweet queen, sweet queen! Please don't be upset with me, I beg you.
To upset a sweet lady is a sour offense.
No, that won't work, it really won't. No, I don't care for such words, no and no. Anyway, Troilus wants you to excuse him if the king asks to see him at supper, and asks that you would give an excuse for him.
My lord Pandarus...
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is it my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?
What is he up to, where will he be eating tonight?
No, my lord listen to me...
What is it sweet queen? My cousin will fall out with you. I cannot say where he will be eating.
I'll bet my life Cressida's stolen him away from my company.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, no, nothing of the sort, you couldn't be further from the truth. Be reasonable, anyway Cressida is unwell.
Sure, I'll make an excuse for him.
Ah, thank you my lord. Why did you think it was Cressida? It couldn't be her, because she's ill.
I spy...
You spy! What do you spy? Quickly, give me an instrument. Now I will play, sweet queen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, suddenly you are very keen to play.
My niece is jealous of you, sweet queen.
Whatever she wants I am sure she'll have it, so long as it isn't Paris.
Ah she doesn't want anything to do with him, those two are so different.
They could still fall in love and fall out again, such falling in and out could make the two of them into three of them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh be civil, I'll hear no more of this. I'll sing a song for you now.
Yes, yes, play now. Honestly, sweet lord, you do look so handsome and smart.
Yes, you may treat me like that.
Sing a love song. Love will be the ruin of us all. Oh, Cupid, Cupid, Cupid.
Ah, yes. It will be about love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ah wonderful, sing about nothing but love, love, love.
Truly I will, and now I begin.
Love, love, nothing but love, even now!Because, oh, love's bowShoots buck and doe.The arrow confuses,But doesn't hurt,It tickles the wound.The lovers cry "Oh! Oh! I am dying!"But the arrow that seems to pierce the wound,Turns moaning into laughter,Letting the dying lovers live on:At first they moan, then they laugh,And those that moan long to laugh.So it is!
This is love alright, summed up perfectly.
Love eats nothing but doves, and that causes a hotness in the blood. Hot blood leads to passionate thoughts. Passionate thoughts cause lustful actions. And lustful actions are love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is this really where love comes from? Hot blood, heated thoughts, and lustful actions? These things sound like a can of worms. Is love a can of worms? Sweet lord, who is out on the battlefield today?
Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the knights of Troy. I was eager to go out today, but my sweetheart wouldn't let me. How come my brother Troilus didn't go out?
He's keeping tight-lipped, I'm sure you know why, Lord Pandarus.
I don't, sweet queen. I wonder how the battle has gone today. Remember to excuse Troilus from dinner?
I will excuse his whole body.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Goodbye, sweet queen.
Say hello to your niece for me.
I will, sweet queen.
They are leaving the battlefield. Let's go to Priam's hall to greet the soldiers. Sweet Helen, would you mind helping Hector out of his armor, your delicate white hands will open the buckles on his armor more easily than any weapon or Greek would. Go do something no Greek king has done, disarm great Hector.
I'd be glad to help him, Paris. Doing him this service will enhance my beauty. Yes the act of service will outshine my beautiful self.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweetheart, I love you more than I can say.
Hey! Where's your master? Is he at my cousin Cressida's house?
No sir, he is waiting for you to take him there.
Oh, here he comes.
Hi, how's it going?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Servant, you may leave.
Have you seen my cousin?
No, Pandarus. I wait outside her door like a lost soul waiting to be taken across the river Styx. Oh, be my Charon, and take me to the paradise where deserving people lie on beds of lilies. Oh gentle Pandarus, carry me like Cupid to Cressida!
Wait here in this orchard, I'll bring her over soon.
I am giddy, and dizzy with excitement. Thoughts of her enchant my senses. What is it going to be like to taste love? I fear it would kill me or knock me out, or that some great joy, whose strength and sweetness I couldn't handle, would overpower me. I worry that all the things that make me happy will become totally indistinguishable, like a heap of bodies in a battle.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She's getting ready, she will soon come here, so pull yourself together. She's flustered and blushing and doesn't know how to feel, I'll bring her out. She's a pretty sight, she is short of breath, like a bird that has just been caught.
I feel the same. My heart is beating like a drum, and I can barely contain myself, I feel so unprepared.
Hey now, why are you blushing? Shame is for children. [To Troilus] Here she is, tell her all those feelings you told me. [Cressida moves away] What's this, are you going away? Do I have to guard over you while you're tamed? Come along, come along, if you try and run off, I'll have to hold you still. [To Troilus] Why aren't you saying anything? Come, let's take off this veil and see your face. [PANDARUS unveils CRESSIDA] Oh my, you shouldn't hide your face from the sun, I'm sure you'd be more open in the dark. Go on, go on, start the game, kiss her. [TROILUS and CRESSIDA kiss] Woah there, a kiss without an end. This is going well and love is in the air. You'll soon be a couple. She is as keen as he is, go on, go on.
You've left me speechless, lady.
Actions speak louder than words, and she'll have your actions too, given half a chance. [TROILUS and CRESSIDA kiss] Hah, kissing again? The debate seems to be going well with both sides in agreement... come on in, I'll get a fire going.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you go inside, my lord?
Oh Cressida, I have so often wished you would call me that!
You have, my lord? Well may the gods grant... oh my lord!
What have the gods done? Why do you suddenly seem so startled? Is there something wrong with the fountain of our love?
There's more dirt than water, if my fears are correct.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fear makes good things seem bad, it hides the truth.
Blind fear, following reason, takes a safer path than blind reason stumbling ahead without fear. Expecting the worst often prevents it from happening.
Oh, don't worry my lady. In Cupid's pageant there are no monsters.
Not only no monsters, but nothing monstrous at all?
Nothing is monstrous except for our promises: when we claim that we could weep seas, live in fire, eat rocks or tame tigers, because we assume that it would be more difficult for our mistresses to ask something that we would not do. This is the thing that is monstrous about love, my lady, that our will-power is greater than our abilities. Our desire is great but our abilities are limited.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They say that all lovers promise more than they can do but don't do everything that they can, promising ten times what they can do and doing only a tenth of it. Isn't it monstrous that they can speak like lions but only act like hares?
Do such people exist? We are not like that. Speak of us as you find us, let us prove ourselves. We won't congratulate ourselves until we deserve it. Nor will we promise things that will happen in the future, but only look to the here and now. We won't claim a virtue before it is demonstrated, and when it has been we will admit it humbly. A few words are enough to swear loyalty. Troilus will be so true to Cressida that Envy itself will not be able to mock him, except for being true. Troilus will be as true as Truth itself.
Will you go inside, my lord?
You're still blushing? Have you not finished talking?
Uncle, if I talk too much I must have learnt that from you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thank you for the offer! If you do become pregnant by Troilus, you can "dedicate" it to me. Stay faithful to Troilus. If he pulls away from you, blame me for it.
Well now you have two hostages: your uncle's promise and my oath of loyalty.
No, I'll vouch for her to you as well. Members of my family, although they take a lot of time to be seduced, are faithful when they are won. Like a dart they stick where they land, I swear.
I feel bold and confident now. Prince Troilus, I have loved you desperately for many long months.
Why were you so hard to win over then?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hard to be won over only in appearance. I was won, my lord, by the first glance that I ever ... I'm sorry. If I say too much you'll be able to take advantage of me. I love you now. But before now I loved you and was able to control it. Oh, that's not true, my thoughts about you were like naughty children that had become too confident to obey their mother. Oh we are such idiots! Why have I spoken so openly? Who would be honest to someone who is so bad at keeping their own secrets? Even though I loved you, I didn't pursue you. But I did wish that I were a man, or that women had the male privilege of being able to approach the men that they liked. Sweetheart, tell me to be quiet, because in this elated state of mind I will say something I'll regret. Oh you aren't saying anything, it is a trick to make me talk so that in my weakness I give up all of my judgment. Kiss me to stop me talking!
As you wish. [He kisses her]
How cute.
My lord, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to seem like I was begging for a kiss. Oh I am ashamed of myself. Oh heavens! What have I done? I think I should leave for now, my lord.
You have to leave, sweet Cressida?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Leave? If you go anywhere before tomorrow morning...
Please, don't argue.
What is upsetting you, lady?
My own behavior, sir.
You can't leave yourself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let me try to. I have a kind of self that lives with you, and an unnatural self that will betray itself and become someone else's fool. I want to leave. Where has my mind gone? I don't know what I'm saying.
No one speaks as well as you without knowing what they are saying.
Maybe I am just pretending to be in love, my lord. And faked my confession of love to lower your guard. But I couldn't fool you, or you can't truly love me, because to be wise and in love at the same time is more than a man is capable of. Only the gods can do that.
If I believed that a woman could keep her love burning forever, and to remain faithful, and to maintain a clear mind after the end of her beauty, then I would believe that you were capable of it. Or if I could be convinced that my own integrity and truth could be matched with another equal to it, I would be overjoyed! But alas, I am as true as truth, and I am more straightforward than truth in its own infancy.
I'd argue against that.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well it would be a virtuous argument, when one truthful person argues with another about who is most true. In the future when young men want to prove their honesty they will call themselves Troilus. When they write poems about love, full of claims, promises and grand comparisons, and run out of imagery after using every trick in the book they will say at last that they are "as true as Troilus," a phrase that will prove their love.
I hope that you will be shown to be a prophet! If I am unfaithful, or in any way stray from loyalty, I hope that future generations, when the rain has worn away the stones of Troy, and entire cities have been forgotten, and whole states disappear into nothing, still use my name for those women who are unfaithful in love! When they've said "as false as air, as water, the wind, or the sandy earth, as false a fox is to a lamb, or as a wolf is to a cow, or hunter to a deer, or step mother to her son," at that point let them get right to the heart of falseness and say they are "as false as Cressida."
Go for it, that sounds like a deal. Seal the deal, and I will be your witness. [PANDARUS holds the hand of TROILUS and CRESSIDA] Now I am holding your hand, and yours. If you are ever unfaithful to each other, let all go-betweens be forever called by my name. Call them Pandars. Let all faithful men be called Troilus, all unfaithful women be called Cressida, and all match-makers be called Pander! Say, amen!
Amen.
Amen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Amen. Now we have agreed that I will show you to a room with a bed. Don't worry about the bed, which it can't tell anyone what it sees, smother it until it dies. Go! May Cupid give all confused young women the gifts of a bed, a room, and a pander to help them along!
Now, princes, the time has come for me to ask you for a reward for the service I have done for you. Remember that, because I can see into the future, I have left Troy, leaving behind all my possessions and deserving a traitor. I have risked my comfortable and stable life. I have given up all the time, friends, and good-standing that I had. Because I wanted to help you I have come here, as if I was new to the world. I ask you to show me now a small part of the reward  that you promised me.
What would you like, Trojan? Ask for it.
You have a Trojan prisoner called Antenor, who you captured yesterday. Troy values him very highly. You have often asked Troy to release my Cressida in hostage exchanges, which I thank you for, but you have had no luck. Now I know that Antenor, who is so important to their leadership that their discussions must be slack without his management. I reckon they would almost give us one of the royal princes, one of King Priam's sons, in return for Antenor. Let him go back, great princes, in return for my daughter. Her presence would be payment enough for all the service I have done for you, despite the hardships it has brought upon me.
Let Diomedes hand over Antenor, and bring Cressida here. Calchas will get what he wants. Good Diomedes, dress well for this exchange, and tell them that if Hector is still willing to go through with his challenge that Ajax is ready.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll do this, I am honored that I can be of service.
Achilles is standing in the entrance of his tent. If you please general, you should walk past him and treat him like a stranger, as if you had completely forgotten him. And, fellow princes, I suggest you also pay no attention to him. I will walk behind everyone else. It is likely he will ask me why no one recognizes him. And if he does this, I will provide a bitter-sweet medicine, and advise him on how to fix his reputation, a medicine he'll willingly take. It will do him good. Only pride can be a lesson for pride, and our previous attempts to bow to Achilles only made him more proud.
We'll do as you say, and deliberately pretend not to notice him as we walk by. Each lord should do this, and don't greet him unless you do so disdainfully, which will upset him even more than if he were ignored. I will go first. [AGAMEMNON walks past ACHILLES]
What, does the general come to speak with me? You know my decision, I won't fight against Troy anymore.
[To Nestor] What is Achilles saying? Does he want to talk with me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To Achilles] Do you want to say something to the general, my lord?
No.
[To Agamemnon] He has nothing to say, my lord.
Excellent.
[To Menelaus] Hello, good day.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To Achilles] How are you? How are you?
Huh, does the cuckold treat me scornfully?
[To Patroclus] Hello, Patroclus!
[To Ajax] Good morning, Ajax.
Huh?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To Ajax] Good morning.
[To Achilles] Yeah, have a good week.
What is wrong with these people? Don't they know me?
They pass by like they don't know you. They used to bow before you and smile when they came to Achilles, as humble as when they go to pray.
What, have I lost my reputation? When great men lose their good fortune they also lose all the respect of their fellow man. The newly unfortunate man reads his fall in the eyes of other people. In that respect people are like butterflies who only show their wings during the summer: men show respect only to those who appear honorable on their outside, even if their successes were by accident rather than merit. And when a great man falls the love that other people have shown to him falls too, the one bringing down the other so they both die. But it won't be like this with me, good fortune is my friend. I still have all the strengths I used to have, except these men's attentions. I think these men have seen something in me that they don't respect as much as they used to. Ulysses is coming, I'll interrupt his reading. [To ULYSSES] How's it going, Ulysses!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hello, great son of Thetis.
What are you reading?
A strange man tells me: "That no man, no matter how naturally talented, rich, or in favor with the king, can boast of what he has nor understand what his duty is except by seeing how other people treat him. Virtues warm the people around them, and that heat is then reflected back."
That is not strange, Ulysses. Someone with a beautiful face wouldn't know it unless other people tell them. And an eye, our greatest natural tool, cannot see itself except by looking at something reflective, or gazing at another person's eye. Sight only happens when we look away, and the image comes back to us. There is nothing unusual about what the man says.
I'm not calling his argument strange, it is a common idea, but I wonder what he means by it. He argues cleverly that no one really possesses any quality, no matter how there is in him, until they have demonstrate it to others. He also shows that we cannot know anything of ourselves except through other people's applause. We only can only judge ourselves through the reflection of our actions, like an echo in a tunnel, or a steel gate that receives the sun and shines it back. I have been very interested in this, and was immediately reminded of Ajax. By heaven, what kind of man is he? He's like a horse that doesn't know how he is being exploited. By nature, there are some creatures that are hated but useful, and others that we value highly but have no use! Tomorrow we'll all see an opportunity that pure luck has given him. Can you imagine Ajax being a hero? Oh heavens, it is amazing what opportunities some men will take and others will leave. Some men skulk around and avoid greatness even though luck is on their side, whilst others act like fools to try to become famous. The second man, although he is less worthy, steals the fame that should be the first man's. You should see the Greek lords! They are already patting the idiot on his back and cheering him as if he had already triumphed over Hector and made great Troy shriek.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know, they all walked past me earlier and looked at me like I was a beggar, saying nothing and not even looking at me. Are my deeds already forgotten?
As time passes all our actions are forgotten. Good deeds only last a moment and then become worthless. Only perseverance, my lord, keeps honor fresh and bright. To have done something is to be always out of fashion, like a rusty suit of armor. Take the most direct route, because honor always takes a path that is straight and narrow: keep on the path as there are always a thousand other men running after, one by one. Give them any room, or step aside, they'll rush past you in an instant and leave you behind. It is like a horse who falls at the front of the battle, and is run past and trampled on by those who come from behind. A success made now is worth much more than a past success, even if it is a lesser success, yes. Time is like a fashionable host who quickly says goodbye to his parting guest before embracing the next guest coming in: you are welcome when you show up but not when you leave. Virtues like honor, intellect, beauty, and so on, shouldn't ask to be respected for what they were but for what they are. People only value new things, even when their old possessions are better made. Someone in the present only praises things that are in the present: so you shouldn't be surprised that all the Greek lords are starting to cheer for Ajax, as he is still active. They once cheered for you, and still could cheer for you again, if you stopped burying yourself in your tent and thinking about how great you were. Especially since you were so great that the gods themselves had to enter the field of battle, even Mars!
I have good reasons for not coming out.
Well, there are better and more heroic reasons for you to come out. It is well known that you are in love with one of Priam's daughters, Achilles.
Hah, what do you mean?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Are you surprised? Nothing escapes the notice of a good government, even the affairs of the gods can not be kept private from their spies, and thoughts can be understood before they are spoken. There is a kind of government knowledge that is never spoken of, and that is more godly than I could ever express in words. Every message you have sent over to Troy is as well known to us as it is to you, my lord, and I think it would be far more fitting that you wrestle Hector than Polyxena. It will be embarrassing for your son, Pyrrhus, back in Greece, when the news comes in and all the Greek girls start singing:"Achilles won great Hector's sister,But our great Ajax bravely slayed Hector."Goodbye, my lord, speaking as your good friend I have to say, the fool is taking what should be yours.
I have told you this before, Achilles. An angry woman who acts like a man is better than a man who acts like a woman when it's time to fight. I am getting the blame for this, as everyone thinks that because I don't want to fight and you don't want to leave me you won't fight as well. Sweetheart, get up, and matters of love will fall from you like sweat from a lion's mane.
Will Ajax fight Hector?
Yes, and maybe become famous for defeating him.
My reputation is at stake, my good name has been attacked.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then be cautious, the damage we do to ourselves is the hardest to heal. Refusing to do what you have to guarantees a bad result. And danger is always just around the corner, even when we are idle.
Go and fetch Thersites, sweet Patroclus. I'll send the fool to Ajax and tell him to invite the Trojan lords here after the fight to meet us here without our weapons. I am sick with love, and desperate to talk with Hector away from the battlefield.
You won't have to bother fetching Thersites.
There is an incredible sight!
What?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ajax is pacing up and down the field looking for "a jakes."
Why?
He must fight one-on-one with Hector tomorrow, and is proudly confident that he will be heroically defeated so he walks around saying nothing loudly.
How is that possible?
Oh he is walking around like a peacock, taking a step then standing still, and posing like a barmaid who can't count up the bill. He bites his lip and looks contemplative, like a man who has all the answers but wont say them, but the only way you'd get anything out of his head is by knocking his brains out! He can't win, because if Hector doesn't kill him, his vanity would. He didn't even recognize me earlier: I said "Good morning Ajax," and he replied "Thanks, Agamemnon." What kind of man would think I am the general? He's like a walking goldfish or some kind of language-less monster. Reputation is ridiculous. Man can wear it one way or another, like a leather waistcoat.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I want you to tell him something from me, Thersites.
Me? He won't speak to anyone, it's like a motto to him: speaking is for beggars. He only talks through his fighting. I will show you what he's like, tell Patroclus to give me your message, and you'll see how ridiculous Ajax looks.
Go on Patroclus, tell him I humbly desire that the valiant Ajax would invite the valorous Hector to come unarmed to my tent, and to ask the very brave Agamemnon not to harm my guests, et cetera. Say that.
Jupiter bless the great Ajax!
Hmm!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have come on behalf of the worthy Achilles...
Ha!
Who very humbly asks you to invite Hector to his tent...
Hmm!
And to get a guarantee of safety from Agamemnon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Agamemnon!
Yes, my lord.
Ha!
What is your reply?
God bless you with all my heart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your response, sir?
Tomorrow's battle, if it happens, will have been decided by eleven o'clock. And whatever happens I shall make sure he is hurt before either of us wins.
Your response, sir?
A warm goodbye.
Surely he isn't really like this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, but he is. I don't know what sense will be in him when Hector has dashed out his brains, but it would take Apollo to make him understand.
Come here, I want you to deliver a letter to him.
I should take it to his horse, his horse is more sensible.
This is all very troubling, and I don't know how the future will play out.
Stupid man! I'd rather be an insect than this arrogant fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Look there! Who is that?
It's the lord Aeneas.
Are you the Prince himself? If I had as good a reason not to get out of bed as you, prince Paris, nothing but prayer would get me to leave my wife alone.
I agree. Good morning, Lord Aeneas.
A brave Greek, Aeneas, greet him! You told me he has been finding you out on the battle field all week and never leaving you alone, and here he is again!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I hope you are well, valiant sir, for at least as long as we have this truce. But when we begin fighting again, I'll make sure I see you dead.
[Embracing AENEAS and PARIS] Greetings to both of you. We aren't enemies at the moment, so for now I hope you are well! But when we start fighting again, by Jupiter, I'll try to kill you with all my strength, skill, and intelligence.
It will be like you are hunting a lion, one that will run from you facing towards you. But now I greet you as a human, welcome to Troy! Now, on my father's life, welcome! By Venus my mother's hand I promise, that no one has ever loved a person they intend to kill as much as I do now.
I feel the same. Jupiter, let Aeneas live a thousand years, unless I kill him myself. But, let him die bloody and broken tomorrow, all for the sake of my honor.
We understand each other well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, and we both hope that the other will be worse as well.
This is the most violent and polite greeting I have ever heard of, with the most noble and hateful love. Why are you up so early, lord?
I was told to come to the king, but I don't know why.
I can tell you why he sent for you. He wants you to bring this Greek to Calchas's house, and when you are there to give him the beautiful Cressida for the freedom of Antenor. You're welcome to stay with me for a bit, or, go there before me. [Aside to AENEAS] I am quite sure, or to be honest I know for a fact, that my brother Troilus is staying at that house tonight. Wake him up and tell him we are coming, although I don't think we'll be very welcome when he finds out why.
I am certain you are right, Troilus would rather we gave Troy to Greece than Cressida to the Greeks.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It can't be helped, this bitter time demands that it must be so. Go, lord, we'll follow you.
Goodbye everyone.
Tell me honestly, noble Diomedes, given this spirit of friendship, who most deserves to have the beautiful Helen, myself or Menelaus?
Both of you equally deserve her. Menelaus deserves her since he is willing to do all this, bringing about a hellish war and costing two countries a massive amount, without caring that she has been spoiled. Equally, you deserve to keep her, since you fight for her without noticing that she is dishonorable, having cost so much money and so many of our friends. He, like a grovelling cuckold, is desperate for someone else's table scraps, and you, like a creep, are willing to father your children with a whore. If you compare the two of you, both of you deserve her the same amount, you're identical except that one of you has the whore.
You're too unkind towards your countrywoman.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Trust me, Paris, she's been too unkind to her country. A Greek has died for every worthless drop of blood in her unfaithful veins. And a Trojan has died for every gram of her festering flesh. She hasn't spoken as many pleasant things as Trojans and Greeks died for her.
Fair Diomedes, just like a trader you are insulting the thing you want to buy, so it will be cheaper. But I won't defend her, as I have no desire to sell her. Come this way please.
Don't get up, my dear, it's cold this morning.
Then I'll have my uncle open the gates, my lord.
Don't trouble him, go to bed, go to bed. Let sleep close your beautiful eyes, and rest peacefully.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Goodbye, then.
I beg you, go to sleep.
Are you tired of me?
Oh Cressida! If it was still night and day hadn't broken, I'd stay with you.
Night has been too short.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Curse the witch! If you have troubled sleep she seems to last forever, but if you are holding your lover she barely lasts long enough to realize. You'll catch a cold and hate me, if you stay out at this time of day.
I beg you, stay. You men never stick around. Oh foolish Cressida! If I hadn't given in to you you might have stayed. Listen! Someone's nearby.
[Within] What, why are all the doors open?
It is your uncle.
Curse him. He's going to start mocking me again. I'll never hear the end of this!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, well. What's the price of virgin? Hey, you there young girl! Where's my cousin Cressida?
Go hang yourself, naughty mocking uncle! You go about making me do something, and then you laugh at me for it as well.
Do what? Do what? Let her say what, what have I helped you do?
Oh behave, have some decency! You'll never live a good life, nor allow others to live good lives.
Ha ha! Alas, poor wretch! Ah, poor thing. Haven't you slept last night? Would the naughty boy not let the thing sleep? Oh what a naughty man!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What did I say he would be like? I wish someone would knock him out.
Who's at the door? Good uncle, go and see. [To TROILUS] My lord, come back into my bedroom. Why are you smiling? Oh, not like that!
Haha.
Come on, you're wrong, I'm not thinking about that.
They are knocking so loudly! Please, come in. I don't want anyone to know you are here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who's there? What's the matter? You're going to break the door down! What's the matter?
Good morning, lord, good morning.
Who's there? My lord Aeneas! I honestly, didn't recognize you. What's wrong that means you come here so early in the day?
Is Prince Troilus here?
Here? Why would he be here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Look, he's obviously here, don't deny it. It's important he speaks to me.
You say he's here? Oh, well, I wouldn't know, honestly. I only came back recently. Why would he be here?
You mean "who" should he be doing here! No, come on then. You'll hurt him if you're not careful. You're covering for him, but betraying him. I don't care if you know he is here, go get him. Now.
Hey, what's the matter?
My lord, I hardly have time to say hello, my business is so important. Outside the house are your brother Paris, Deiphobus, the Greek Diomedes and the Trojan Antenor, who has been returned to us. And in return for Antenor, before we even go to prayer, right now, we must give up Lady Cressida to Diomedes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This has been decided?
By Priam and the politicians of Troy, they are outside ready to make it happen.
My success has turned to despair! I will go and meet them, my lord Aeneas, I'll pretend to have just been passing by, don't say you saw me here.
Yes, my lord. No one is more discrete than me.
Is it possible? No sooner got than it is lost? I'd give Antenor to the devil! The young prince will go mad, I hope a plague takes Antenor! I wish the Greeks had broken his neck!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hey, what's the matter? Who was here?
Ah, ah!
Why are you sighing so deeply? Where's my lord? He's gone! Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
I wish I were dead!
Oh gods! What's the matter!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I beg you, go inside, I wish you had never been born! I knew you'd be the thing that kills him. Oh, poor gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!
Good uncle, I beg you, on my knees, I beg you, what's happened?
You must go, girl, you must be gone, you are going to be traded in return for Antenor. You must go to your father and away from Troilus. It will be his death, his torture, the one thing he couldn't possibly bear.
Oh gods! I will not go.
You have to.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will not, uncle. I have broken relations with my father, and don't recognize him as my family. He is not my relative, I feel no love for him, I am not of his blood, and there is no soul worth so much to me as that of Troilus. Oh divine gods! Make my name a common by-word for infidelity if I ever leave Troilus! Oh Time, Force, and Death: do whatever you can to me, my love for Troilus is stronger than the gravity that holds us on the earth. I'll go into my room to cry...
Do, do.
I'll tear out my hair and scratch at my cheeks, scream until my throat hurts, and break my heart crying Troilus's name. I will not leave Troy.
It is late in the morning, and nearly time we give her to this brave Greek. Good brother Troilus, go tell the lady what she has to do, and tell her to be swift.
Go into her house, I'll bring her to the Greek immediately, and when I hand her over to him, I will think of it as a marriage ceremony. Like a priest, except I will give away my own heart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know what it is to love, and wish I could help him. Please go in, my lords.
Be reasonable, be reasonable.
Why are you telling me to be reasonable? This grief is totally appropriate and exactly as violent as the reason that causes it! How can I be more reasonable that this? If I could make it less painful, or water down my love, it would also be an appropriate cure for my grief. My love can't be diluted, nor can my grief, when what I am losing is so precious to me.
He is coming.
Oh, such a sweet couple.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh Troilus! Troilus!
These two are an extraordinary sight! Let me embrace you too. "Oh heart," as the great saying goes, "... oh heavy, heavy heart, Why do you sigh without breaking?" and the heart replies:"Because you cannot ease your pain,with company or words."There has never been a better saying. Let us never forget anything, for one day we might need a saying like this. How are you, lambs?
Cressida, I love you so purely that the divine gods are taking you away from me, as they are angry that my devotion to you is stronger and more passionate than my devotion to them.
Are the gods envious of me?
Yes, yes, yes, yes. That is too obvious a question.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And is it also true that I must leave Troy?
A hateful truth.
And must I leave Troilus too?
You have to leave Troy and Troilus.
How can it be?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And our bad luck is splitting us up suddenly. It stops us saying goodbye, pushes past our moment of hesitation, rudely prevents our lips from meeting, and stops us from embracing each other. It strangles our promises to each other when they have only just been born. Even though we spent so many thousands of sighs winning each other, we now lose each other spending only one sigh. Time is hasty like a thief, bundling up his stolen object without knowing how valuable it is. What is as valuable as the stars in heaven, with so much breath and kisses devoted to each one, he bundles up into a brief goodbye. He allows us only a brief kiss, ruined by our salty tears.
[Within] My lord, is the lady ready to leave?
Listen! They are calling you. Some people say that a guardian spirit shouts "come" to a man who is about to die. [To PANDARUS] Tell them to be patient, she will come soon.
Why am I not crying? I feel like I need to cry or my heart will be torn out.
I have go to the Greeks, then?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There is no way of stopping it.
I will be a sad Cressida among happy Greeks. When will we meet again?
Listen to me, my love. If you are just true to your heart...
Are you questioning my truth? How come? What an evil judgment on me is that?
No, we must protest gently, as we don't have much time. I'm not saying "be true to me" because I fear that you won't be. I would duel with Death himself to prove that there is no stain of infidelity in your heart. But I say "if you are true" so that I can add "then we will see each other again."
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, you will face dangers, my lord, as immediate as they are infinite! But I will be true to you.
I will befriend danger. Wear this sleeve. [TROILUS gives CRESSIDA a sleeve]
Wear this glove. [CRESSIDA gives TROILUS a glove] When will I see you?
I'll bribe the Greek guards, so that I can see you at night. Just be true to me.
Oh heavens. He's telling me to "be true," again!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Listen, love. Young Greek men are full of good qualities: they're loving, well put together, fluent in their education and swollen from exercise. The way that this new situation could persuade you, and touch certain parts of you, I'm afraid that a kind of godly jealousy... Which I hope you can consider a virtuous sin... Makes me afraid.
Oh heavens! You don't love me.
Then I would die a villain! I am not questioning your loyalty so much as my own merit. I cannot sing or dance the "volta," I don't sweeten my speech, and I'm not manipulative. These are the good virtues that the Greeks are all good at and full of. And in each of their talents there will be a tempting devil. But don't be tempted.
Do you think I will be?
No. But sometimes things happen against our will, and sometimes we are devils to ourselves if we assume that our power to resist temptation will not change.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Within] No, my good lord...
Come, kiss me, and let us go outside.
[Within] Brother Troilus!
Good brother, come here, and bring Aeneas and the Greek with you.
My lord, will you be true?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who me? Alas, my fault, my vice, is that I must be true. Other people are very artful in fishing for a good reputation, but with my great honesty the only thing I can catch is a reputation for being simple. Other people gild copper crowns with cunning, I wear my crown bare, expressing only truth and plainness. Don't worry about me being loyal: my motto has always been "plain and honest," and that's all there is to it.
Welcome, Sir Diomedes! Here is the lady which we must give you in return for Antenor. I'll give you her hand at the gate, lord, and from there you will possess what she is. Treat her as fairly as she is fair. I promise you, good Greek, that if you are ever at the mercy of my sword in battle, you just have to say her name and your life will be as safe as Troy.
Fair lady Cressida, you don't need to thank this prince: the spark in your eye and your blushing cheek demand that I treat you fairly. You shall be mistress to Diomede, and command me wholly.
Greek, you are not to treat me courteously, by insulting my genuine request that you keep her safe and praising her yourself. I'm telling you, Greek lord, she flies above your praises and you are unworthy of being her servant. I charge you to treat her well, and do it because I charge you to do it. If you do not do it, even if the huge Achilles were protecting you, by Pluto, I will cut your throat.
Oh don't get upset, Prince Troilus. The privilege of being a messenger and a noble means that I can speak freely. When I am away from here I'll do as I please, and I don't do anything because I am charged to. She will be prized well because of her worth. But if you tell me to treat her well, then on my honor and with all my heart I'll tell you "No."
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let us go to the gate. This insult, Diomedes, will make you flee me on the battlefield. Lady, give me your hand, and as we walk to the gate we'll talk between us only.
Listen, it is Hector's trumpet.
How has the morning already passed? The prince must think I am late and neglectful, since I promised to ride out to the battlefield before him.
It's Troilus's fault. Come, let's go to the battle with him.
We should go immediately.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, let's follow Hector with the speed of a bridegroom who is full of joy. The glory of Troy all depends today on his strength and chivalry.
You are here fresh and ready, waiting bravely for the time to fight. Blow your trumpet loudly to give a message to Troy, terrifying Ajax, that the awful sound might assault his ears and bring him here.
You, trumpeter, here is my money. Now blow as hard as you can. Blow, man, until you cheeks are more full of air than the entire sky. Now puff out your chest and play until your eyes cry blood. You are blowing to Hector.
There is no reply.
It's not been long enough.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Isn't that Diomedes with Calchas's daughter?
It is him, I recognize the way he walks. He has a spring in his step, and his spirit seems to lift him above the ground.
Is this the lady Cressida?
It is her.
Welcome to the Greek camp, sweet lady. [AGAMEMNON kisses CRESSIDA]
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Our general greets you with a kiss.
But this is just the kindness of one man, she should be kissed by everyone.
That's good advice, I'll begin. This is from Nestor. [NESTOR kisses CRESSIDA]
I'll warm your lips, fair lady. Achilles welcomes you. [ACHILLES kisses CRESSIDA]
I used to have a good reason to kiss.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But that's no reason for kissing now. Paris thrust himself in, with his boldness, and separated you from your reason. [PATROCLUS kisses CRESSIDA]
Oh that terrible reason, the reason for all our suffering! The reason is why we lose our heads to decorate his horns.
The first kiss I give you is from Menelaus. This one is your kiss from Patroclus. [PATROCLUS kisses CRESSIDA again]
Oh, good one.
Paris and I do all his kissing for him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, if you don't mind.
Do you give a kiss or take one?

I bet my life that the kiss you take is better than the kiss you receive. Therefore I won't kiss you.
I'll give you a profit, I'll kiss you three times in return for one kiss from you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You're an odd man. Give equally or don't give at all.
An odd man? Lady, every man is just one person.
No, Paris isn't, and you know that because of him you are alone and he has got even with you.
That hurt.
I don't think it was me that hurt your head.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It's no competition, your nails against his horn. May I, sweet lady, beg for a kiss from you?
You may.
I wish to.
Go on, then, beg.
Why then, for Venus's sake, give me a kiss when Helen is a virgin again and back with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will honor that when what you say is true.
Then I'll never have a kiss from you.
Lady, may I talk with you. I will bring you to your father.
She's a quick-witted woman.
Bah, sod her! There's wit in her eyes, cheeks, lips, even her foot is witty. Her promiscuous spirits pour out of every joint and limb of her body. Oh, these confident women, so clever with their tongue, they show what they really want to anyone willing to take her up on it! Consider her either an easy prize to be won by anyone bold enough to try or a prostitute.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The Trojans' trumpet.
Here come their soldiers.
Greetings to you, Greek rulers. How will the winner be rewarded? Or how do you intend that the victory be decided? Do you want the knights to fight to the death, or should they be stopped by a referee? Hector told me to ask you.
What conditions does Hector want?
He doesn't care, he'll obey any conditions.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is how Hector speaks, confidently, a little proudly, and greatly underestimating his opponent.
Who are you, if you aren't Achilles?
If I'm not Achilles, I am nothing.
Therefore Achilles, or whoever you are, listen: there is great braveness and little pride in Hector. The first is almost infinite, the other almost nothing. If you look at him you'll see that when he seems proud, he is actually being polite. Ajax is a relative of Hector, and so their blood is half the same. Because of this, half of Hector comes to fight. And with only half of his heart, and one of his hands, Hector comes to fight this half-Trojan, half-Greek knight.
This won't be a fight to the death then? I see.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is Sir Diomedes. Go, noble knight, and stand with Ajax. Whatever terms you and Lord Aeneas agree to shall be the rules for the battle. Let it be either to death or just a sporting fight, if the combatants are related they won't be able to hate each other fully.
They are already prepared to fight.
Who is that Trojan who looks so sad?
The youngest son of king Priam, a good knight, not yet fully grown up, but still an unequaled knight: an honest man, who speaks with actions not words. It's hard to make him angry, and hard to calm him down when he is angry, but he is generous with both his love and his possessions. Whatever he has he shares, and whatever he thinks he shows, but only to people who he should be generous towards, and he would never be so dishonorable as to say anything inappropriate. He is as manly as Hector but more dangerous. For while Hector can be expected to show mercy even when he is angry, when he is in the heat of the fight, this knight is even more vengeful than a jealous lover. He is called Troilus, and the Trojans see him as a second hope, as well built as Hector. This is what Aeneas said to me in private when I visited Troy, and he knows the young man very well.
They are fighting.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come on Ajax, defend yourself.
Hector you are fighting as if you're asleep, wake up!
His attacks are well aimed, good shot, Ajax!
You must stop fighting.
Princes, please stop.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I haven't even broken a sweat, let's fight again.
If Hector is happy to continue...
Then I will stop here: you are, great lord, my father's sister's son, and the first cousin to all of Priam's sons. Because we are family we are not allowed to kill each other. If it were possible to separate your Greek and Trojan parts so that you could say: "This hand is all Greek, and this one is Trojan, the muscles in this leg are all Greek, and this one is Trojan, my Trojan mother's blood is in my right cheek, and the left cheek is made of my father's Greek blood," then, I swear by Jove, you would not leave this fight with a Greek limb on your body. But the gods forbid that I use my sword to spill any of your mother's, my sacred aunt's, blood! Let me embrace you, Ajax, by Jove, you have strong arms and I'd rather they embraced me than fought me. All honor to you, cousin!
Thank you Hector, you are too generous and gentle. I came to kill you, cousin, and gain honor from you dying.
Not even the great Achilles, who Fame herself declares is her favourite, could expect to have that honor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Both sides wait for your answer about what you will do.
We'll give you this answer: the outcome of this fight is an embrace. Ajax, goodbye.
Maybe I can have more success with my words, something I rarely get a chance to do. I invite my famous cousin to the Greek camp.
It is Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles wants to see the valiant Hector without his weapons.
Aeneas, go bring Troilus to me, and tell the Trojans who expect me to come back that I am going to meet the Greeks and that they may go home. Give me your hand, cousin, I will eat with you and meet your knights.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Great Agamemnon is coming to meet us here.
Tell me the names of the most important people. Except for Achilles, I'll recognize him from his large build.
Brave fighters! You are welcome here, even though we would be glad to be rid of such an enemy. But that's no welcome. Understand me clearly, our past and future are full of skeletons and total destruction. But this moment allows you to be welcomed, great Hector, honestly and faithfully, free of any prejudice, with the most divine fair dealing.
Thank you, imperial Agamemnon.
[To TROILUS] I welcome you as well, famous Trojan lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'd like to welcome you as well, warrior brothers, you are welcome here.
Who are you, may I ask?
The noble Menelaus.
Oh it's you? Many thanks, by Mars! Don't be upset that I don't pass on best wishes from your ex-wife, but she told me not to.
Let's not talk about her now, sir, she's a bad topic.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, excuse me. I'm offending you.
I have, gallant Trojan, often seen you doing Death's job and cruelly cutting a path through ranks of young Greek soldiers, and I have seen you, as hot as Perseus, riding your warhorse showing your scorn for those soldiers who beg for mercy, holding your sword in the air rather than letting it fall on the fallen. And I have said to some other observers: "Look, Jupiter himself has come, deciding who should live and who should die!" And I have seen you pause and catch your breath, when you have been surrounded by a ring of Greek soldiers, like a wrestler entering the ring. This I have seen but until now I never saw your face without a helmet on. I knew your grandfather, and once fought with him. He was a good soldier, but by Mars, the captain of us all, I never saw anyone like you before. Let an old man embrace you, and welcome you to our tents, worthy warrior.
This is old Nestor.
Let me embrace you, wise old story-teller, that has lived a very long life. Respect-worthy Nestor, I am glad to hold you in my arms.
I wish my arms were as strong as yours, I cannot hold you so tightly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I wish they could.
Ha! By my white beard, I would fight with you tomorrow if I could. Well, welcome, welcome! I cannot believe I have lived to see this.
I wonder how Troy is still standing without you standing there to hold her up.
I know your face well, Lord Ulysses. Ah, sir, many Greeks and Trojans have died since I last saw you and Diomedes in Troy as ambassadors.
Sir I told you then what would happen. My prophecy has only been half fulfilled, though. For those walls over there, that hold up your town so shamelessly, and those towers, which so lustfully kiss the clouds, will kiss their own feet when they fall.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I can't believe your visions will come true. Troy's walls are still standing, and they look modest to me. Every stone that falls from our walls will cost a drop of Greek blood. The end is the conclusion of everything, and time will be the judge of everyone.
Then we will leave it to him. Most gentle and valiant Hector, welcome. After you have visited the general, I ask that you will come and eat with me at my tent.
I shall interrupt you there, lord Ulysses! Now, Hector, I have feasted my eyes on you. I have seen you very well indeed, Hector, and considered every joint.
Is this Achilles?
I am Achilles.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stand still, please. Let me look at you.
Take your fill of looking.
No, I am already done.
You are too quick. I'd like to see you a second time, so that I will know what to do with you.
Oh, you'll read me like a hunting book will you? There's more inside me than you understand. Why are you glaring at me like this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tell me, heavens, how I should destroy him? Should I attack there, or there, or there? I need to know so that I may name the place where I wound him, and can know the breach out of which Hector's great spirit flew. Answer me, heavens!
It would be dishonorable for the blessed gods to answer, proud man. Stand up again. You think it will be so easy to speculate in advance where you will strike me dead?
I think so, yes.
If you were an oracle and thought so, I would not believe you. From now on protect yourself well. For I won't kill you there, nor there, nor there. But, I swear by Mars, I'll kill you everywhere, yes, over and over again. Wise Greeks, forgive me for boasting like this, I'll make sure I carry out what I have said or I'll never...
Don't get angry cousin. And you, Achilles, stop making threats, until by accident or intention you may do it. You can spend every day fighting Hector as much you want, if you have the stomach for it. The generals, I suspect, cannot encourage you enough to triumph over him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I beg you, come find me on the battlefield. We've been play-fighting since you stopped fighting.
Are you asking me to do that for you, Hector? Tomorrow I will find you, as terrifying as death. Tonight we are friends.
I'll shake to that.
First, all of you brave men, go to my tent. There we shall feast together, and afterwards you can all meet Hector when you want. Beat the tambourines, play the trumpets, so that this great soldier knows how welcome he is.
Lord Ulysses, please tell me where Calchas is staying?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is in Menelaus's tent, Prince Troilus. Diomedes is feasting with him there tonight. He is unable to look up or down, but only has loving eyes for the fair Cressida.
Would you be so kind as to take me there after we leave Agamemnon's tent?
If you wish, sir. Would you mind telling me what Cressida's reputation was like when she was in Troy. Did she not have a lover there who misses her?
Oh, sir, those who boast by showing their scars deserve to be mocked. Will you go ahead, lord? [To himself.] She was beloved, she used to love. She is loved, and she loves. But sweet love is the food of fortune.
I'll heat Hector's blood with Greek wine tonight, and tomorrow I will cool it with my scimitar. Patroclus, lets entertain him well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here comes Thersites.
Hey there, you heart of envy! You ugly misfit, what's the news?
That you are what you look like, an idol for people who worship idiots. Here's a letter for you.
Who from, worm?
You dish of fool, from Troy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who is staying in their tent now?
I'll laugh at his wounds.
Very clever, always understanding the opposite of what I'm saying! Are your tricks useful?
Please, stop talking, boy. I don't gain anything from talking to you. You are thought to be Achilles's boy-lover.
Boy-lover, you rogue! What did you say?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, his male prostitute. Now I will call you syphilis, gut-ache, lesions, mucus, gall-stones, tiredness, fevers, sore eyes, bladders full of abcesses, liver disease, boils, gall-stones, skin-diseases, ringworm, accept these many unacceptable truths!
Oh you evil, box of envy. What do you mean by cursing like this?
Are these your names I have been cursing you with?
No, you hateful arse, you son of a whore, you malformed wretch, no.
No? Then why are you so angry, you idle fabric decoration, you pampered eye-patch, you ornament, you? Ah the whole world is filled with leeches like you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Get out, you blister!
You finch-egg!
My sweet Patroclus, I can't carry on with my plan to go to battle tomorrow. This is a letter from Queen Hecuba, and has a message from her daughter, whom I love, which is making me promise not to break an oath I have sworn. I can't break my oath even if it means the Greeks losing or my losing my fame. The only vow I care about is this, and I'll obey it. Come, come, Thersites, tidy up my tent, we will spend this night banqueting. Let's go Patroclus!
With too much passion and too little brain, these two will go mad. But if they do go mad with too much thinking and too little courage, I will be considered a curer of madmen. Here comes Agamemnon, an honest man and one that loves eating quails. But he doesn't have as much brain as he does earwax. And the walking embodiment of Jupiter stood next to him, his bull-like brother, the original model and monument to all cuckolds, is a coward, like a tool hanging from his brother's belt... What worse shape could an angry god make you into? If he were turned into an ass or an ox that would be fine, because he is already both. If were turned into a dog, a mule, a cat, a polecat, a toad, a lizard, an owl, a hawk, or a worthless fish, I wouldn't care, but I would do anything to avoid being turned into Menelaus. Don't ask me what I would be if I wasn't myself, because I would be perfectly happy as a louse or a leper, anything but Menelaus! Look at that, they are caring torches!
We've gone the wrong way, we've gone the wrong way.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No it is this way, there, where the light is.
I've asked too much of you.
No, not at all.
Here he comes to show us the way.
Welcome, brave Hector, welcome everyone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, now I will say goodnight, fair prince of Troy. Ajax will tell the guard to look after you.
Thanks and goodnight, Greek general.
Goodnight, my lord.
Goodnight, sweet lord Menelaus.
[Aside] That's a "sweet" thing to say! "Sweet" like a drain, "sweet" like a sewer.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Goodnight or welcome, if you are coming or going.
Goodnight.
Old Nestor is staying here, and you too, Diomedes, come in and keep Hector company with me.
I can't, lord, I have important business that must be seen to at once. Goodnight, great Hector.
Give me your hand.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Aside to TROILUS] Follow his torch, he's going to Calchas's tent: I'll come with you.
[Aside to ULYSSES] Sweet sir, you honour me.
And so, good night.
Come this way, enter my tent.
That Diomedes is a false-hearted rogue, and an unjust fool. I don't trust him when he looks at me anymore than I do when a snake hisses at me. He is always promising so much and never delivers, like a hound running away from the scent. If he is ever actually honest astronomers see it as a sign from the gods, it is such a rare event: the sun will take its light from the moon before Diomede keeps his word. I'll leave Hector rather than stop following him. Apparently he has a Trojan mistress, and keeps her in Calchas's tent, I'll follow them. I'll have nothing but lechery and easy women!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hey, is anyone awake in there? Speak.
[Within] Who is asking?
I think that is Calchas. Where's you daughter?
[Within] She is coming out to meet you.
Stand in the shadows, away from the light.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cressida is coming out to him.
How are you, my ward?
Oh, my sweet guardian! Listen, I want to tell you something.
She's acting so familiar with him!
She will play with any man without knowing them first.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And any man may sing her song, if he can find her key. She's noted like an instrument.
Will you remember?
Of course I will remember.
Well, make sure you do, and prove what you say with actions.
What has he asked her to remember?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Listen.
Sweet-speaking Greek, don't tempt me to do any more foolish things.
What kind of poor behavior is this?
No, then...
I'll tell you what...
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Bah! Tell me nothing. You are promised to someone else.
Honestly, I can't. What would you have me do?
A clever thing to say... one that shows her to be secretly open.
What did you promise you'd give to me?
I beg you, don't make me do what I promised. Ask me anything other than that, sweet Greek.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Goodnight.
How can I endure this?
Quiet, Trojan!
Diomedes...
No, no, goodnight. I'm not going to be your fool anymore.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You better had.
Listen, let me say one thing into your ear.
[Shouts] Oh plague and madness!
You are upset, prince. Let's go, I beg you, in case your anger makes you violent. This is a dangerous place and a deadly time for you to be here. I beg you, go.
Look, I beg you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, my lord, leave. You are going insane, come, my lord.
I beg you, stay.
You don't have the patience, come.
I beg you, stay. No matter what torture I see I won't say a word.
And so, goodnight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, you are still angry.
Does that bother you? Oh your truth has died!
Woah, lord!
By Jupiter, I will be patient.
Guardian... oh, Greek!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pah, pah, goodbye, you time waster.
Honestly, I am not wasting your time. Come here again.
You are shaking, my lord, will you leave here? You are going to blow your cover.
She is stroking his cheek.
Come, come.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, stay, by Jupiter, I won't say a word. My patience will stop me from saying or doing anything dangerous. Let's stay a little longer.
Luxury, like a little devil with a fat bottom and thick fingers is getting these two excited. Go on, Lechery, go on!
So you will then?
Honestly I will, ha. If I don't then never believe me again.
Give me a token so that I can be sure.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll fetch you one.
You have promised to be patient.
Don't worry about me, sweet lord. I will pretend I am not me and put my emotions aside. I can be patient.
Here's her promise. Now, now, now.
Here, Diomedes, keep this sleeve. [CRESSIDA gives DIOMEDES the sleeve Troilus had given her]
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh beauty! Where is your loyalty?
My lord...
I will be patient, or at least I won't move.
You look at that sleeve, take good care of it. He loved me... oh you unfaithful girl... give it back to me. [Cressida takes the sleeve back]
Whose was it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It doesn't matter, I want it back. I won't meet with you tomorrow night, I beg you, Diomedes, don't visit me again.
Now she whets his appetite. Well done, like a whetstone!
I'll have it.
What, this?
Yes, that.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, all you gods! Oh, pretty gift! The person who gave you to me is lying in his bed now, thinking of his gift and me, and sighing. He will be taking my glove, and kisses it to remember me, just as I kiss you now. [CRESSIDA kisses the sleeve and DIOMEDES steals it from her] No, don't take it from me! The person who takes that from me steals my heart itself.
I have already won your heart, so this token comes afterwards.
I swore patience.
You won't have it, Diomedes. I swear, you won't. I'll give you something else.
I will have this. Whose was it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It doesn't matter.
Come, tell me, whose was it.
It belonged to someone that loved me better than you will. But now you have it, keep it.
Whose was it?
By Diana and all her companions, I will not tell you whose it was.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tomorrow I will wear this on my helmet, and see if he comes forward.
[Quietly] If you were the devil himself, and wore it on your horns, I would still come and fight you.
Right, it is done, it is over. But no, it's not, I won't keep my word.
Okay then, goodbye, you'll never see me again.
You mustn't go. I can't say anything without you running off.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'm getting bored of this.
Nor me, by Pluto. But I am glad you are upset.
Well, should I come when we agreed? Same time?
Yes, come. Oh Jupiter! Do come. I will be cursed.
Goodbye until then.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Goodnight. I beg you, come tomorrow.
Goodbye Troilus. Part of me still belongs to you, but another part of me cannot help itself. Ah, women are so weak! I think our fault is that we use our eyes to make decisions not our brains! People who are only guided by bad judgments, must do bad things. Oh, brains that are lead by eyes are full of bad thoughts.
She couldn't sum herself up better, unless she said "My mind has become a whore."
It's over, my lord.
It is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why are we still here, then.
To make a record in my soul of everything that was said here. Although these two are so deceitful together, that if I spoke the truth everything I said would be dishonest. Although there is still some trust in my heart and some hope so stubbornly strong, that it turns upside down what my eyes and ears have seen, as if those organs had been created only to make up lies. Was Cressida here?
I can't perform magic, Trojan, I couldn't fake all the things you saw.
Surely she wasn't here.
She definitely was.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I don't think I have gone mad, she wasn't.
I definitely haven't gone mad, Cressida was just here.
For the sake of womankind, let this not be believed! Since we ourselves had mothers. Don't let the stubborn critics of women, who don't have an example of their depravation, blame their sex by Cressida's example. It is better not to think this was Cressida.
What has she done, prince, that would be an insult to our mothers?
Nothing at all, unless that was her.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will he convince himself out of it, despite all he's seen?
This, her? No, this is Diomedes's Cressida. If beauty has a soul, this is not her. If souls guide promises, if promises are sacred, if being sacred is what the gods care about, if there is any justice in the world, that was not her. Oh mad talking, that argues against itself! A duplicitous judgment! Why won't my logic let her be and not be Cressida. There is a fight in my soul to bring these two possibilities together although they are further apart than the sky and the earth. But the divide between these two possibilities is as impossible to get out of as a labyrinth using Ariachne's broken spider web. With one important exception! At once Cressida is mine and tied to me by heaven, and at the same time those ties have broken and she has tied another knot to Diomedes with her unfaithful dishonesty.
Can the worthy Troilus really be as angry as he seems?
He'll beat him for his lover.
Oh Cressida! Oh false Cressida. False, false, false! Let all lies be given your name, that way they'll seem glorious.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, be patient, your anger is drawing attention to us.
I have been looking for you for an hour, my lord. Hector is getting ready for war in Troy, and Ajax, your guard, is getting ready to walk you home.
I'll come with you, prince. Courteous lord, goodbye. Farewell, ugly beauty! And, Diomedes stand up tall, you'll need a strong helmet to protect you!
I'll show you to the gates.
Please forgive me for not thanking you well enough, I am overwhelmed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I wish I could wait outside Diomedes's tent like an omen of bad luck. I know, Patroclus would give me anything for information of such a woman as this. A parrot will not do more for an almond as he will do for easy women. Lechery, lechery, more wars and lechery! Nothing else is so fashionable at the moment. I hope a devil takes the lot of them.
Since when have you been so angry, husband, that you won't listen to my advice? Take off your armor, put down your weapons, and don't go out to fight today.
You're provoking me want to upset you. Go back inside, by all the gods, I swear I will go out and fight.
I am sure my dreams predict something bad happening today.
Stop speaking, enough.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where is my brother Hector?
Here he is, sister, in his armor and intent on fighting. Join my loud and clear pleas, let's follow him on our knees. I have had dreams of a bloody disaster, for the whole night, nothing but dreams about different kinds of slaughter.
Oh, it is true.
Ha! Tell them to blow my trumpet!
For heaven's sake, don't make any suggestion that you will go out there, sweet brother.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go away, I say. The gods have heard my promise.
The gods are deaf to unwise and angry promises. They aren't proper promises or offerings to the gods, and are bad sacrifices.
Oh, listen to her! Don't think it is holy to let yourself be injured for being just. It is as holy as stealing for the purpose of charity.
It is only the reason behind a promise that makes it justified. Any old promise does not need to be binding. Disarm, sweet Hector.
Stop there, I said. My honor is more important to me than my destiny. Every man values his life, but a brave man values his honor far more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hello there, young man! Are you planning to fight today?
Cassandra, bring my father here to help persuade them.
No, honestly, young Troilus, take off your armor, young man. I am going out today as a knight should. You should let your young body grow older, don't take the risks of war yet. Disarm yourself and go, and don't doubt, brave boy, I'll fight hard enough today for you, me and all of Troy.
Brother your mercy isn't appropriate here. You aren't a lion, you are a man.
What inappropriate mercy have I shown, good Troilus? Tell me off for it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Many times when a Greek soldier was defenseless in front of your sword, and you let them get up and live.
Oh, this is just fair play.
This is how idiots fight, by heaven, Hector.
Woah, woah.
For the love of all the gods, leave your pity at home with our mothers, when we are armed, we carry vengeance in our swords, and we must use them to do sad work, without becoming sad about it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, savage, you're wrong!
Hector, this is a war.
Troilus, I don't want you to fight today.
What is going to stop me? Fate won't, nor would obedience, nor the hand of Mars if he used a burning weapon to make me go back. Not my father or mother begging on their knees and their eyes full of tears. Not you, brother, if you drew your sword to fight me, unless you managed to kill me first.
Grab him, Priam, hold him still. He is like your crutch, he supports you. Now if you let him go all of Troy will fall down with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, Hector, go back inside. Your wife has dreamed, your mother has had visions, Cassandra foresees, and even I feel like a prophet and feel inspired to tell you that today is ominous. Therefore, come back inside.
Aeneas has gone to battle. And I have promised myself to many Greeks, bound with a oath of bravery, to go out there this morning.
Yes, but you should not go.
I must not break my promise. You know that I am honest. Therefore, dear sir, don't make me disrespect you by ignoring you. Allow me to go out with your blessing, royal Priam.
Oh Priam, don't let him go!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Don't, dear father.
Andromache, I'm upset with you. If you love me, go inside.
This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl is the person making all these bad predictions.
Oh, goodbye, dear Hector! I can see you dying! I can see your eyes turning pale! I can see blood pouring from your many wounds! I can hear Troy screaming! I can hear Hecuba crying! Your wife, Andromache, is screaming with grief! I see confusion, hatred, shock, and awful things all coming for you! Everyone will scream: "Hector! Hector's dead! Oh Hector!"
Go away, go away!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Goodbye, still living Hector! Let me go, you are going to ruin yourself and all of Troy.
You are in shock, my liege, at what she has said. Go in and make the town happy, we'll go out and fight, and perform great deeds that we can tell you about tonight.
Goodbye. May the gods watch over you.
The men outside are fighting, listen! Proud Diomedes believe me that I will either lose my arm or regain my sleeve!
Have you heard, my lord? Have you head?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is it?
A letter has come from the poor girl.
Let me read it.[TROILUS reads the letter]
A terrible cough, a really awful cough is troubling me, and the fortunes of this girl. What is true of one thing is true of the other: I will leave you one of these days. My eyes are rheumatic, and my bones ache so much. I must be cursed, because I cannot thing what else I might have. What does she say in the letter?
Words, only words, nothing meaningful. What she says and the truth aren't the same.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Scatter and dance in the wind. She still feeds my love for her with her words, but loves another person with her actions.
Now the two armies are fighting hard, I'll watch them. That lying, detestable crook Diomedes has got the equally awful young Trojan's sleeve on his helmet. Oh I would love to see them fighting and see the young Trojan that loves the whore send the whoring Greek villain to the lying and unfaithful girl without any sleeves at all. On the other side of the battlefield, the tactics of the old mouse Nestor and foxhound Ulysses are as worthless as a blackberry. They had made me set up Ajax against Achilles, but now Ajax is even prouder than Achilles and won't fight today either. Soon the whole Greek army will be uncontrollable, but I must keep quiet, here comes the knight with the sleeve and the other man.
Don't flee me. Even if you were crossing the river Styx, I would swim after you.
You are wrong to say I'm retreating: I wasn't fleeing, bu being careful to withdraw from a place where I was outnumbered, alone in a crowd. Defend yourself! [They fight]
Defend your whore, Greek! Fight for your whore, Trojan! Now fight for the sleeve! The sleeve!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who are you, Greek? Are you able to fight Hector? Are you brave and noble?
No, no, I am not a brave man, I am just a sick, unpleasant creature, a dirty rogue.
I believe you, you may live.
God bless you for believing me, but curse you for scaring me! What's happened to the whoring thugs? Maybe they have eaten each other up, that would be a hilarious sight, although I suppose lust and greed do consume the people they meet. I'll find them.
Go, go, servant, take Troilus's horse and show it to my lady Cressida. My man, tell the beautiful lady that she is mine, tell her I beat her Trojan lover, and I am now her knight because of this.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will go now, my lord.
Rally! Rally! The fierce Polydamas has beaten Menon, Margarelon the bastard has Doreus prisoner and stands over him like the Colossus of Rhodes, waving this sword over the broken bodies of the kings Epistrophus and Cedius. Polyxenes is dead, Amphimachus and Thoas are fatally wounded, Patroclus has been taken prisoner or killed, and Palamedes has been badly beaten. Their cavalry are terrifying our soldiers. We must hurry, Diomedes, to reinforce our soldiers, or all of us will die.
Go, show Patroclus's body to Achilles, and tell Ajax to arm himself. It is as if there are a thousand Hectors out there today, you see him one moment fighting on Galathe his horse, and the next moment he is fighting on foot where our soldiers either flee or are killed like schools of small fish before a hungry whale. Then you'll see him over there, harvesting Greeks like they were wheat. He appears here, there, and everywhere and decides who shall live and who shall die. His skill is perfectly matched to his desire to kill, so much so that he can do anything he wants, and he is doing so much that proof of it would be called impossibility.
Be brave, be brave, princes! Great Achilles is arming himself, weepings, cursing, and promising revenge. Patroclus's wounds have awoken his sleepy rage, and he is rallying his Myrmidons many of whom have been horribly injured and all of them wanting to kill Hector. One of Ajax's friends has died, and he is now foaming at the mouth with anger, because of this he has armed himself and come out to find Troilus, who has killed a great many people today. Troilus has been reckless in engaging our soldiers and even when the odds almost guaranteed his death, he simply kills them and moves on as if luck itself was on his side.
Troilus! You are a coward Troilus!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, over there, over there.
We are pulling together now.
Where is Hector? Come here boy-killer, show yourself. You will learn what it is like to meet me when I am angry. Hector? Where's Hector? I won't deal with anyone except Hector.
Troilus, you coward Troilus, show yourself!
Troilus, I say! Where's Troilus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What do you want with him?
I want to correct him.
You aren't taking the pleasure of killing him away from me. Troilus, I say! Where are you, Troilus!
Oh it is the traitor Diomedes! Turn your deceitful face towards me, you traitor, and die for stealing my horse!
Ha, where are you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I want to fight him alone, stand back Diomedes.
I have the right to kill him, I won't just be a spectator.
Come, both of you cheating Greeks, I'll fight you both!
Is that Troilus? Oh, you fight well youngest brother!
Now I see you, ha! Defend yourself, Hector! [ACHILLES fights HECTOR]
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You can rest, if you like.
I disdain your courtesy, proud Trojan. You should be glad that I am out of practice. My rest and recent refusal to fight has given you the advantage, but I will find you another time, until then go and do what you want.
Goodbye, I wouldn't have let myself be so tired if I knew I would have to fight you. What's this, here's my brother!
Ajax has captured Aeneas, should we allow him to do this? No, by the sun, he won't be allowed to capture him. I'll either be captured as well, or I'll set Aeneas free. Fate, hear what I am saying! I don't care if I die today.
Stand and fight me, you Greek. You are a worthy target. No? You won't fight me? I like your armor, I'll hack at it and take it to pieces, so that I can keep it for myself. Won't you fight me, you beast? Why then keep running away, and I'll hunt you for your hide.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Gather around me, my Myrmidons, and listen to what I say. Form up behind me and follow me as I turn, don't attack anyone but instead keep yourselves ready, and when I have found the bloodied Hector, surround him with your weapons and kill him fiercely. Follow me, men, and watch where I go. I demand that the great Hector must die.
The cuckold and the man who made him a cuckold are fighting each other. Attack him, bull! Attack him, dog! Go, Paris, go! Fight.  Go, Paris, go! The bull can fight, watch out for his horns, woah!
Turn, slave, and fight.
Who are you?
One of Priam's bastards.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am a bastard too, I love bastards. I am a bastard by parentage, educated by a bastard, a bastard in my thoughts, when I fight I fight like a bastard, and am illegitimate in every way. Bears don't eat each other, so why would two bastards? Listen, two children with whores for mothers shouldn't fight, because we might be brothers, and then we would be guilty of killing a relative. Goodbye, bastard.
Curse you, coward.
Cowardly man, so beautiful on the outside, your beautiful armor has cost you your life. Now I am able to finish for the day, and rest well. Take a rest, sword, you have had enough blood and death today.
Look how the sun begins to set, Hector. Now night is pursuing him. Just as a dark shadow is coming over the earth, Hector's life is over.
I have disarmed, don't take advantage like this, Greek.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Attack, men, attack. This is the man I have been hunting.
Now, Troy, you will fall next. Fall, Troy, now! Here's your heart, strength and support. Carry on, Myrmidons, and cry out that "Achilles has killed the mighty Hector."
Listen, are the Greeks retreating?
The Trojan trumpets are doing the same thing as ours, my lord.
As night comes our armies stop fighting. My sword has only just begun to drink blood, and it would have liked to be fed, but it can go to bed happy at having killed this man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, tie his body to my horse's tail, I'll drag the Trojan through the battlefield.
Listen! Listen! Who is shouting like that?
Drums, stop playing!
Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles!
The message is that Hector's slain, and by Achilles.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If that's true he shouldn't boast about it. Great Hector was as good a man as Achilles.
Let's carry on walking back, send someone to ask Achilles to see us in our tent. If the gods have let Hector die then Troy is ours and these awful wars will be over.
Keep fighting! We are winning the battle. Never return home, we'll fight throughout the night.
Hector is dead.
Hector! Oh gods, don't let it be true!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He's dead, and he is being dragged through the shameful battlefield from his killer's horse's tail like an animal. Be angry at this, gods, and smite them! Oh gods, sitting on your thrones, and smile on Troy! Put us out of our misery, and don't prolong our destruction!
My lord, you are upsetting our army.
You don't understand me, I'm not saying we should run away, or be afraid, or that we will die, but I challenge all imminent dangers from gods and men that they are preparing for me. Hector is dead, and who is going to tell Priam or Hecuba? Send someone who is prepared to tell this ominous news go to Troy and tell them that Hector is dead. That word will make Priam turn to stone, that will make young women and wives turn into wells of tears, and, with that one sentence, scare Troy out of its senses. Go, march away, Hector is dead, there's nothing else to say. But you hateful tents that are pitched proudly outside our city, you can stay. Let the sun rise early tomorrow, because I will run you through with my sword! And you, huge coward, there is no distance that shall stop me hating you. I'll haunt you like a bad conscience that created goblins as quick as frenzied thoughts. March quickly into Troy, and go with the comfort: hope of revenge will hide our inner sorrow.
Listen, listen!
Go away, you middleman! May dishonor and shame follow you for the rest of your life, and may your name always mean "pimp."
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, this is a good medicine for my aching bones! Oh world! World! World! In this way the poor servant is hated! Oh traitors and matchmakers, how honestly are you made to work, and how badly are you rewarded? Why should people love what we make possible, but hate us when we do it? What poem can describe this What argument can I used to object to this? Let me see: [Singing]The bumble bee sings very merrily,Until he has lost his honey and his sting.And when his weapon has been subdued,His sweet praise and happy words are spent.[Stops singing] Men who trade in flesh, make pictures out of this: "As many people here are in Pandar's house, even though your eyes are half-gone, you should still cry for Pandarus's sad fate. If you cannot weep, groan instead, and if not for me then for your aching bones." Brothers and sisters of the prostitution business, two months from now I'll die and my will will be read. I would put it on now, but I am worried that some bitter Winchester goose would shout at me. Until then I will try to find something to help ease my symptoms, and at that time I will let you inherit my diseases.
If music feeds love and makes it stronger, then keep playing music. Give me too much of it, so much that it kills my longing for love and makes it go away. Play that part again—it sounded melancholy. Oh, it sounded to me like a sweet breeze blowing over a bank of violets, stealing their scent and distributing it to everyone. That's enough now, no more music. It doesn't sound as sweet as it did before. Oh spirit of love, how restless you are! You make me want to accept everything, like the sea does, but then the next minute everything seems worthless, no matter how valuable it is. Love is like a hallucination—nothing else is so imaginative and extravagant.
Do you want to go hunting, my lord?
Hunting what, Curio?
The hart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am already hunting a hart, but it's also my heart being hunted. Oh, when I first saw Olivia, it seemed to me that she purified the air with her very presence. In that instant I was transformed into a hart, and ever since then my desire for her has pursued me like a pack of cruel hunting hounds.
What's going on? What's the news from her?
I'm sorry, my lord, they wouldn't let me enter, but Olivia's handmaid gave me this answer: the outside world won't see Olivia's face for the next seven years. She'll wear a veil like a nun, and once a day she'll water her room with her tears. All of this is to preserve her love for her dead brother, whose memory she wants to keep fresh forever.
Oh, if the heart inside Olivia's beautiful body loves her brother this much, then imagine how she will love me once Cupid's arrow has killed all her other emotions except love! Her mind, heart, and body—each of them a precious kingdom—will all be ruled by one man—me! Now take me to a garden of flowers. My thoughts of love will be strengthened by a beautiful setting.
What country is this, friends?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is Illyria, my lady.
And what should I do in Illyria? My brother is in Heaven. Or perhaps there's a chance he didn't drown. What do you think, sailors?
It was only by chance that you yourself were saved.
Oh, my poor brother! But maybe he has been saved by chance too.
True, madam. And let me comfort you: when our ship was wrecked, and you and the few other survivors hung onto our drifting lifeboat, I saw your brother tie himself to the mast that was floating on the waves—acting with courage and hope in the middle of great danger. For as long as I could see him, he safely rode upon the waves like Arion on the dolphin's back.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Giving him money] Here's some gold to thank you for telling me this. My own escape gives me hope for my brother, and what you've told me now gives me even more reason to hope. Do you know this country?
Yes, madam, I was born and raised less than three hours' travel from here.
Who rules here?
A duke who is as noble in his character as he is in his rank.
What is his name?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Orsino.
Orsino—I have heard my father mention him. He was a bachelor back then.
And he still is, or was very recently at least. I only left here a month ago, and at that time there was a popular rumor—as, you know, people gossip about the nobility—that he was courting the fair Olivia.
Who's she?
A virtuous young woman, the daughter of a count who died a year ago. He left her in the care of his son, Olivia's brother, but the brother died soon after. They say that out of love for her brother, Olivia has stopped interacting with men altogether.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, I wish that I could serve that lady—then I wouldn't have to reveal myself to the world until I was ready to identify my place in society.
That would be hard to bring about, because she won't allow anyone in to see her, not even the duke's men.
You seem to be a good man in both behavior and appearance, captain, and even though nature often makes beautiful people corrupt on the inside, I believe that you have a noble mind to fit your good looks and manners. Please—and I'll pay you well for this—help me conceal my identity, and find me the disguise that will suit my intentions. I want to serve this duke. You will present me to him as a eunuch. It will be worth your trouble, for I can sing and speak well, and he will surely consider me for his service. What might happen after that, only time will tell. You must only match my wit with your silence and discretion.
You will be his eunuch, and I will be your mute attendant. If I tell your secret, may I lose my sight.
I thank you. Lead me on.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is ailing my niece, that she reacts so strongly to her brother's death? I'm now sure that caring too much is bad for one's health.
By God, Sir Toby, you must come home earlier at night. Your niece, my lady, strongly disapproves of the late hours you keep.
Well, let her disapprove of me—I disapprove of her.
Yes, but you must at least confine yourself within the limits of order and decency.
Confine myself? I'll only confine myself to these clothes I'm wearing. They're good enough to drink in, and these boots are too. And if they aren't, then let them hang themselves by their own straps.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* All this drinking will be your ruin: I heard my lady Olivia talking about it yesterday. She also spoke of some foolish knight you brought here one night to woo her.
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
Yes, him.
He's as tall and brave as any man in Illyria.
What does that have to do with anything?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, he has an income of three thousand ducats a year.
Yes, but he'll only make all those ducats last for one year. He's foolish, wasteful, and reckless.
How dare you say so! He plays the violin, and speaks three or four languages word for word from memory. He has all of nature's good gifts.
He does indeed seem like a natural-born fool—and besides being a fool, he's argumentative. If he didn't have the coward's gift of stepping away from a fight, they say he would've been long dead by now.
By God, anyone who says that about him is a villain and a naysayer. Who said that?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They also say that he gets drunk with you every night.
We are only toasting my niece when we drink. I'll drink to her as long as there's a hole in my throat and alcohol in Illyria. Only cowards and scum wouldn't drink to my niece until their brains spin round like a top. What do you have to say to that! But hush, we must be polite. Here comes Sir Andrew Agueface himself.
Sir Toby Belch! How are you, Sir Toby Belch?
Sweet Sir Andrew.
[To MARIA] And hello to you, pretty wench.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hello to you, sir.
Accost her, Sir Andrew, accost her.
What's that?
This is my niece's chambermaid.
Good Miss Accost-her, I look forward to knowing you better.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My name is Mary, sir.
Good Miss Mary Accost-her—
You're mistaken, knight. "Accost her" isn't her name—I meant that you should face her, greet her, woo her, and conquer her.
I say, I wouldn't do that in this company. Is that really what you meant by "accost her?"
Goodbye, gentlemen. [She starts to exit]
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you let her leave like that, Sir Andrew, you don't deserve to ever draw your sword again.
If you leave like this, miss, I swear I won't ever draw my sword again. Why are you leaving, fair lady—do you think you have fools on your hands here?
Sir, I'm not holding your hand.
Indeed, but you will be, and here's my hand. [He offers her his hand]
[Taking his hand] Now, sir, everyone has a right to their opinions. Please, take your hand to the dairy and let it drink.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What do you mean, sweetheart? Is this a metaphor?
A dry one, sir.
Well, I should hope so. I'm not such a fool that I can't keep my hand dry. But what's the joke?
Just some dry humor, sir.
Are you full of such jokes?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, sir, I have a handful of them. Although now that I've let go of your hand, I've lost the biggest joke I had.
Oh knight, you need some wine. Have you ever been put down like that before?
Never, I think, except when I've been put down by too much wine. Sometimes I think I'm no smarter than a humble, ordinary man. But I eat a lot of beef, and maybe that hurts my intelligence.
There's no question about that.
If I really thought that, I'd give up beef altogether. I think I'll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pourquoi, my dear knight?
What does "pourquoi" mean? Does it mean to do or not do? I wish I had spent more time learning languages instead of fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. Oh, if I'd only studied more!
Then you would have an excellent head of hair.
Why, would that have improved my hair?
Certainly, for you can see that it won't curl naturally.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But my hair still suits me well enough, doesn't it?
It looks excellent. It hangs like flax waiting to be spun. And I hope to see some hussy take it between her legs and spin it off with a venereal disease.
Truly, I'm going home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your niece refuses to see anyone. Even if she did see me, chances are she'd reject me. The duke himself is courting her nearby.
She'll reject the duke. She won't marry anyone who's above her social rank, her wealth, her age, or her intelligence—I've heard her swear this. So cheer up, you're still in the running, man.
I'll stay a month longer then. I must be the strangest fellow on earth. Sometimes my greatest pleasures are masquerades, plays, and dancing.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Are you good at such trifles, knight?
As good as any man in Illyria, as long as he isn't better than I am. And yet I'm not as good as an experienced dancer.
How good are you at the fast dances, knight?
Well, I can cut a caper.
And I can cut the meat to go with your capers.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And I think I can do that tricky backward step as well as any man in Illyria.
Why do you keep these things hidden? Why do you keep your gifts behind a curtain? Are you afraid they'll get dusty, like some woman's portrait? Why don't you show off your skill by going to church dancing a galliard and coming home dancing a coranto? If I were you, even my walk would be a dance. I wouldn't even pee unless I was dancing at the same time. What do you mean by this? Is this a world where we should hide our virtues? I could always tell from your excellent legs that you were born under a dancing star.
Yes, my legs are strong, and they don't look bad in brown stockings. Should we have a little dance?
What else are we going to do? Weren't we born under the sign of Taurus?
Taurus! But that governs the torso and the heart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, sir, it governs the legs and the thighs. Let me see you dance. Ha, higher! Ha ha, excellent!
If the duke keeps favoring you like this, Cesario, you're likely to get promoted very high. He's only known you for three days, and already he's treating you like a friend.
You must be afraid of his moodiness or my faults, if you think there's any chance that he'll stop liking me. Is he usually fickle in his moods and favors?
No, believe me.
I thank you for telling me. Here comes the duke.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hey, has anyone seen Cesario?
I'm here, my lord, at your service.
[To attendants] Give us some privacy for a while. [To VIOLA] Cesario, you know everything about me. I have opened the book of my most secret soul to you. Therefore, good youth, direct your steps to Olivia's house. Don't let them deny you access—stand outside her door and tell them that you'll plant roots there until they let you see her.
But my noble lord, if she is really as brokenhearted as they say, she is sure to deny me an audience.
Be loud and obnoxious, and go beyond the limits of decency and civility if you have to—just don't come back without having spoken to her.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And if I do get to speak to her, my lord, what do I do then?
Oh, then describe the passion of my love for her. Ambush her with descriptions of my faithfulness. It will be best if you act out my feelings—she'll pay closer attention to you, as a young man, than to an older, more serious messenger.
I don't think so, my lord.
Dear boy, believe me. Anyone who says that you're a man is denying you the happy years of your youth. Your lips are as smooth and ruby-red as the goddess Diana's. Your small voice is like a girl's, high and clear, and the rest of you is feminine as well. I know you have been predestined to do this job. [To CURIO and attendants] Four or five of you go with him. All of you can go if you want to, for I feel my best when I'm away from people. [To VIOLA] If you succeed in this you will live as well as I do, and share in all my fortune.
I'll do my best to woo this lady for you. [To herself] And yet, what a conflict—I must go courting on behalf of the man I want to marry myself!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, either tell me where you've been, or I won't say a word in your defense. My lady Olivia will have you hanged for being absent.
Let her hang me then. A well-hanged (and well-hung) man doesn't need to be afraid of anything he sees.
Explain—and clean up your language.
He'll be dead, and so he won't see anything to be afraid of.
That's a meager answer. And I can tell you where you got that saying about not being afraid of anything.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where, good Mistress Mary?
From soldiers at war. And it's bold of you to talk like a soldier, when you're only a fool.
Well, let God give wisdom to those who have it. Everyone has their talents, and for those of us who are fools, let us use our gifts.
But you'll still be hanged for being gone so long. Or at least fired and kicked out, and wouldn't that be just as bad for you?
Sometimes getting hanged saves a man from getting into a bad marriage, and as for getting kicked out, it's summer, so being homeless won't be so bad.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You are firm in your resolve, then?
No, but I am resolved on two points.
Yes—the two points where your suspenders are buttoned on. If one breaks, the other will hold. But if both break, your pants will fall.
Very clever, really, very clever. Well, go along now. If only Sir Toby would stop drinking, you'd be a woman who was as funny as any person in Illyria.
Quiet, you villain, no more of that. Here comes my lady. It would be best for you if you came up with a good excuse for being gone so long.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To himself] Come on, wit, give me something good to say now! Those people who think they're witty often prove to be fools. And I'm sure that I'm not witty, so I might pass for a wise man. For what did the philosopher Quinapalus say? "Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit."
God's greetings to you, my lady!
Take the fool away.
Didn't you hear her, fellows? Take the lady away.
That's enough—you're a dull, dry fool. I'm tired of you. Besides, you're getting unreliable.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My holy lady, these are two flaws that some alcohol and good advice will fix. If you give the dry fool a drink, then the fool won't be dry anymore. And if you give the unreliable man some good advice, then he can mend his ways and won't be unreliable anymore. And if he can't mend his ways, then let the tailor mend him. Anything that's mended is only patched up. A virtuous man who does something wrong is only patched with sin, and a sinner who mends his ways is only patched with virtue. If this logical argument will convince you, then good. But if not, what can be done? The only truly betrayed husband is one deserted by luck, and beauty is a lucky flower—so you won't remain alone for long, my lady. But you gave orders to take away the fool. So I tell you all again, take the lady away.
Sir, I told them to take you away.
An error of the worst kind! Lady, don't judge a book by its cover—that's to say that I wear jester's clothes on the outside, but my brain is still sharp. My holy lady, let me prove that you're a fool.
Can you do it?
Easily, my good lady.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then prove it.
I must ask you some questions then, my holy lady. Please answer them, my virtuous little mouse.
Well, sir, I have nothing better to do, so I'll go along with this.
Dear lady, why are you in mourning?
Dear fool, because of my brother's death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I think his soul is in hell, lady.
I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
Then you're a fool, holy lady, to mourn your brother's soul being in heaven. Now take away the fool, gentlemen.
What do you think of this fool, Malvolio? Hasn't he gotten better?
Yes, and he will until the day he dies. Old age and senility hurt wise people, but improve fools.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then may God send you old age and senility, that you might become a better fool! Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I'm not a clever man, but he wouldn't bet two cents that you're not a fool.
What do you say to that, Malvolio?
I'm surprised that your ladyship enjoys the company of such an empty-headed villain. The other day I saw him lose a battle of wits to an ordinary idiot who had no more brains than a stone. Look at him now, he's without a witty retort already. Unless you laugh and give him an opportunity, he can't think of a thing to say. I declare that the so-called wise men who laugh so hard at these jesters' well-rehearsed routines are no better than jesters' assistants themselves.
Oh, you're sick with vanity, Malvolio, and it affects your good taste. If you were generous, innocent, and friendly, then you wouldn't make such mountains out of mole-hills. There's no real harm in a professional fool, even if he does nothing but mock people. In the same way there's no real mockery in a wise man, even if he does nothing but criticize people.
May Mercury—that god of deception—make you a skilled liar, to reward you for speaking so highly of fools!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, there's a young gentleman at the gate who greatly desires to speak with you.
Is he sent from Duke Orsino?
I don't know, madam. He's a good-looking young man, and has some attendants with him.
Which of my people is delaying him right now?
Sir Toby, madam, your uncle.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Send Sir Toby away, please. He talks like a madman. Shame on him!
You go, Malvolio. If this visitor is a messenger from the duke, then tell him that I'm sick, or not at home. Do whatever you have to to make him go away.
Now you see, sir, how your jokes grow stale, and people dislike them.
Holy lady, you've spoken so highly of us fools—it's almost as if your eldest son was going to be a fool. And may God cram his skull with brains, for here comes one of your relatives whose head is quite empty.
I swear, he's half-drunk. Who is that at the gate, uncle?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A gentleman.
A gentleman? What gentleman?
There's a gentleman here—[hiccoughs] Damn those pickled herring! They upset my stomach. How's it going, you drunken fool?
Good Sir Toby!
Uncle, uncle, it's so early in the day—how are you already so sick?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tricks? I hate tricks. There's a man at the gate.
Yes, I heard, but who is he?
Let him be the devil if he wants to be, I don't care. God will give me the faith to resist him. It doesn't matter to me.
Tell me what a drunk man is like, fool.
He's like a drowned man, a fool, and a madman. The first drink makes him a fool, the second makes him a madman, and the third drowns him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go and find the coroner then, and let him investigate my uncle—for he's in the third degree of drunkenness, and has drowned. Go look after him.
He's still only in the second degree, my lady, so the fool will take care of the madman.
Madam, that young fellow out there swears that he must speak with you no matter what. I told him you were sick. He claims to know that already, and says that that's why he came to speak with you. I told him you were asleep. He claims to know that already too, and said that that's why he came to speak with you. What should I say to him, lady? He's too strong for all my excuses.
Just tell him that he won't speak with me.
I told him that already, but he says he'll stand at your door like a signpost or the leg of a bench until he is allowed to speak with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What kind of man is he?
Why, part of mankind.
But what is his manner?
He has very bad manners. He says he'll speak to you whether you like it or not.
But what does he look like, and how old is he?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He's not yet old enough to be a man, but not young enough to be a boy either. He's like a pea pod or an apple just before it's ripe. He's like a slack tide, caught between coming in and going out—between boyhood and manhood. He's very good-looking, but he's nagging. It seems like he's just barely stopped breastfeeding.
Let him enter. Call in my lady-in-waiting.
Gentlewoman, my lady calls for you.
Give me my veil. Come, throw it over my face. [OLIVIA puts on a veil] Let's hear Orsino's offer once more.
Which of you is the honorable lady of the house?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Speak to me—I'll answer for her. What do you want?
Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty—but please, tell me if you're really the lady of the house, for I've never actually seen her. I would hate to throw away my speech on the wrong person, for it is excellently written and was very hard for me to memorize. Good beauties, please don't scorn me. I'm very sensitive, even to the slightest bit of rudeness.
Where do you come from, sir?
I can only repeat what I've memorized, and that question isn't part of my lines. Please, gentle lady, just assure me that you are the lady of the house, so I can go on with my speech.
Are you an actor?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, my dear lady. But I also swear that I'm not the same person as the part I'm playing. Are you the lady of the house?
If I haven't stolen this role from myself, then I am.
If you are the lady of the house, then you certainly have stolen from yourself, because what's yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself. But this isn't what I was sent to say. I'll go on with my speech praising you, and then I'll get to the heart of my message.
Just tell me the important part. I'll excuse you for skipping the praise.
Oh, but I worked so hard memorizing it, and it's poetic.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then it's more likely to be fake. Please, keep it to yourself. I heard you were rude at my gates, and I let you in because I was curious about you, not to hear your message. If you're not crazy, then go. If you're sane, be quick. I am not in the mood for lively conversation.
Will you set sail and leave now, sir? Here's the door.
No, good sailor, I'll dock here a little longer. My lady, would you call off your giant here?
Tell me what you want.
I am a messenger.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then you must have a horrible message to deliver, since you're so afraid to get to the point. Speak your business.
It only concerns you. I'm not bringing a declaration of war or a demand for praise. I'm only bringing you an olive branch. My words are full of peace.
Yet you began rudely. Who are you? What do you want?
I only learned my rudeness from the way I was received here. Who I am and what I want are as secret as a girl's virginity. I have a holy message for your ears only. It would be blasphemy for anyone else to hear it.
Everyone, leave us alone. I will hear this "holy message."
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, sir, what is your sacred text?
Most sweet lady—
This sounds like a comforting doctrine of faith, one that deserves to be spoken of. Where is the sacred text your "holy message" comes from?
In Orsino's heart.
In his heart? In what chapter and verse of his heart?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To continue this metaphor—in the first chapter of his heart.
Oh, I have read that. It's not a holy message, it's heresy. Do you have anything more to say?
Good madam, let me see your face.
Did your lord order you to negotiate with my face? You've gone off your script now.  But I'll draw the curtain and show you the picture. Look, sir, this is a portrait of me in this present moment. Isn't it well done?
It's excellently done, if that's the way God made it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It's natural, sir. Wind and rain won't wash it off.
It's truly beautiful—your red lips and white skin painted by Nature's sweet and skillful hand. My lady, you are the cruelest woman alive if you'll let your beauty go with you to the grave, instead of having children and passing it on.
Oh, sir, I won't be so cruel. I'll give out lists of my beauty. I'll make a detailed inventory, with every part labeled and added to my will. For example—item: two lips, moderately red. Item: two grey eyes, with lids attached. Item: one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you only sent here to praise my beauty?
I see what you are—you're too proud. But even if you were the devil, you'd still be beautiful. My lord and master loves you. Such love as his couldn't be repaid even if you were crowned the most beautiful woman in the world.
How does he love me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* With adoration, with abundant tears, with thunderous groans, with passionate sighs.
Your lord knows my mind. I cannot love him. I'm sure he is a virtuous man, and I know he's noble, rich, and young. Public opinion reports that he is generous, smart, and brave, both gracious in his manner and good-looking. But despite all that, I cannot love him. He should have accepted my answer long ago.
If I loved you with my master's passion—with such suffering and a life that is like death—your rejection would make no sense to me. I would not understand it.
Well, what would you do if you were your master?
I would build a little cabin outside your gates, and from there I'd call out to you, my soul, in your house. I would write loyal songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly even in the dead of night. I would shout your name to the hills and make their echoes cry out "Olivia!" Oh, you wouldn't be able to go anywhere under the sun without pitying me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There's a lot you would do. What rank are your parents?
I was born to a higher rank than I have now, but I'm still well-off. I am a gentleman.
Go back to your lord. I cannot love him. Tell him not to send any more messengers—unless, perhaps, you were to return and tell me how he takes my rejection. Farewell. Thank you for your trouble. Here is something for you to spend. [Offers VIOLA money]
I'm no paid messenger, my lady. Keep your money. It's my master, not myself, who's going without his due reward. May the man you fall in love with have a heart of stone, and may your passion, like my master's, be scornfully rejected. Farewell, you beautiful cruelty.
"What rank are your parents?" "I was born to a higher rank than I have now, but I'm still well-off. I am a gentleman." Yes, I'll swear that you are; your words, your face, your body, your actions, and your spirit all seem like a coat of arms for a lord. But not so fast! Calm down, calm down! If only Orsino were Cesario. But what's going on? Can someone catch the plague of love this quickly? I think I can feel this youth's perfection creeping stealthily and invisibly in through my eyes. Well, let it happen. [Calling out to MALVOLIO] Come, Malvolio!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here, madam, at your service.
Run after that irritating messenger who just left, the duke's man. He left this ring behind, whether I wanted it or not. Tell him I want nothing to do with it. [OLIVIA hands him a ring] Tell him not to encourage Orsino, or get his hopes up. I am not for him. And tell that youth that if he'll come by tomorrow, I'll give him reasons why. Now hurry up, Malvolio.
Madam, I will.
I don't know what I'm doing, and I'm afraid that I'm falling in love based entirely on good looks—using my eyes instead of using my head. Fate, do what you will. We can't control our destinies. What must be will be, so let it happen.
Won't you stay longer? And don't you want me to go with you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you'll allow it, no. My luck is bad, and my doomed fate might disturb your own destiny. Therefore I will say farewell, and face the evils of my fate alone. It would be a bad way of thanking you if I burdened you with any of my troubles.
At least let me know where you're headed to.
Truly, I can't, sir. The voyage I am determined to make is merely wandering without a destination. But I can tell that you're polite enough to not force me to tell you something I want to keep to myself—so it's only good manners for me to tell you what I can, Antonio. My name is Sebastian, though I called myself Roderigo. My father was Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you've heard of. He is dead now, but he left behind myself and my twin sister, who was born the same hour as me. If only God had allowed us to die in the same hour as well! But you, sir, kept that from happening, for my sister drowned an hour before you pulled me from the breaking waves.
What a tragic day!
She was a lady who many people said looked just like me, but she was also considered beautiful. But though I can't believe all that was said about her beauty, I will publicly declare this much about her: she had a beautiful mind. Even people who were jealous of her would have to admit that. She has already been drowned in the salt water of the sea, sir, and now I seem to be drowning her memory with the salt water of my tears.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Forgive me, sir, for not being a better host.
Oh good Antonio, forgive me for causing you trouble.
Let me be your servant and go with you—if you won't return my devotion, you'll be killing me.
And if you won't undo what you have done—that is, if you don't want to kill the man whose life you saved—then you won't come with me. Say goodbye at once. My heart is full of affection for you, and I'm feeling so effeminate that I'm about to cry. My destination is Duke Orsino's court. Farewell.
May the blessings of the gods go with you! I have many enemies in Orsino's court, or else I would join you there soon. But I don't care—my adoration for you is too strong, and the danger seems trivial to me. I'll go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Weren't you with the Countess Olivia just now?
Yes, just now, sir. I've only made it this far, walking at a moderate pace.
She returns this ring to you, sir. You might have saved me the trouble and taken it with you. She also adds that you should make it clear to your lord that there is no hope—she wants nothing to do with him. And one thing more: you should never return here as Orsino's messenger again, unless it is to report how he takes the bad news. Take the ring now.
She took that ring from me. I don't want it.
Come, sir, you rudely threw it to her, and she wants it to be returned just as rudely. [he throws down the ring] If it's worth stooping to pick up, there it is where you can see it. If not, let whoever finds it first have it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I didn't leave any ring with her. What does this lady mean by this? God forbid that she's smitten by my appearance! She did look intently at me, indeed so much that I thought her eyes had caused her to lose her tongue, for she spoke wildly and distractedly. I think she loves me! She is crafty in her passion, and has used this rude messenger to subtly invite me back. So she doesn't want my lord's ring? Well, he never sent her one. I am the man she wants. If this is true, which it is, then the poor lady would be better off loving a dream. I now see that disguises are a tool to aid the resourceful devil. How easy it is for attractive, deceitful men to mold women's hearts to their will! Alas, it's our female frailty that's to blame—we can't help it. We turn out the way we're made. But how will all this play out? My master loves her dearly, and I, poor androgynous fool, love him just as much. And now she, mistaking me for a man, seems to have fallen in love with me. What will become of all this? In my disguise as a man, I have no hope of winning Orsino's love, but as I am really a woman, Olivia's love for me is hopeless too! Oh time, you must untangle this mess—I can't do it myself. It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
Come, Sir Andrew. To be still awake after midnight is to be up early in the morning, and you surely know that waking up at dawn is supposed to be healthy—
No, truly, I don't know. But I do know that to be up late is to be up late.
A false conclusion. I hate your logic like I hate an empty wine goblet. To stay up past midnight means going to bed in the early morning, so therefore to stay up past midnight is to go to bed early. Doesn't life consist of the four elements—fire, water, earth, and air?
Well, that's what they say, but I think life consists of eating and drinking.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You're a smart man. Let us eat and drink then. Maria, I say! Bring us a big mug of wine!
Here comes the fool, actually.
How's it going, my sweethearts! We are like that picture "We Three"—three fools together.
Welcome, you jackass. Now sing us a song.
I swear, the fool has an excellent voice. I would give forty shillings to have legs like his and his beautiful singing voice. [To the FOOL] Truly, that was some elegant fooling last night when you spoke that astrological nonsense about Pigrogromitus, and the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus. It was very funny, really. I sent you some money to spend on your sweetheart. Did you get it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I put your little gift in my pocket, for Malvolio can't keep his nose out of anything. My lady has lovely white hands, and ancient warriors aren't low class taverns, you know.
Excellent! Why, this nonsense talk is the best kind of fooling when all's said and done. Now sing us a song.
[Giving money to the FOOL] Come on. Here's sixpence for you. Let's have a song.
[Giving money to the FOOL] There's money from me too. If one knight gives a—
Do you want a love song or a drinking song?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A love song, a love song.
Yes, yes. I don't care about virtuous living.
[Singing]Oh my mistress, where are you roaming?Oh, stay and listen! Your true love's coming:He can sing both high and low.Travel no more, my pretty sweetheart.Journeys end when lovers meet,As every wise man's son should know.
That was excellent, truly.
Good, good.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Singing]What is love? It's not the future.Joy in the present means present laughter.What's to come is still unsure.There's no reward for wasting time.So come kiss me while you're sweet and twenty.Youthful beauty will not endure.
A sweet voice if I ever heard one.
A catchy song.
Yes, both sweet and catchy, truly.
If we could hear with our noses, his plague-breath would be sweet indeed. But will we make the sky dance with our antics? Will we wake up the night owl and sing loud enough to make people pray? Will we?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If we're friends, let's do it. I am dog at singing catches.
We'll do it then—some dogs are good at playing catch.
Certainly. Let our catch be "You Villain."
You mean "Shut your mouth, you villain," right? If we sing that then I'll have to call you a villain, knight.
It won't be the first time someone has had to call me "villain." You begin, Fool. It begins, "Shut your mouth."
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I won't ever begin if I shut my mouth.
That's a good one. But come on, begin.
What a racket you're making out here! My lady Olivia called up her steward Malvolio and told him to kick you out of the house—it's true.
My lady Olivia's a trickster, we are clever plotters, Malvolio's a loose woman, and [singing] We are three merry men. Aren't we related? I'm Olivia's uncle, right? Well la-dee-da! "Lady!" [singing]There lived a man in Babylon, lady, lady!
My my, the knight's very good at playing the fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, he's good enough when he feels like it, and I am too. He has more experience, but it comes to me naturally.
[Singing] On the twelfth day of December—
For the love of God, be quiet!
Masters, are you crazy? What's wrong with you? Have you no wit, manners, or honesty, that you're making such a racket at this time of night? Are you trying to turn my lady's house into a noisy tavern by singing these rowdy songs without bothering to lower your voices at all? Do you have no respect for people, this place, or this time of night?
We did respect the time, sir, in the beat of our songs. So go hang yourself!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir Toby, I must be plain with you. My lady told me to tell you that she lets you stay here because you're her relative, but she doesn't approve of your disorderly behavior. If you can start cleaning yourself up, you are welcome to stay in the house, but if not, and you would prefer to leave, then my lady would be glad to bid you farewell.
[Singing] Farewell, sweetheart, since I have to go now.
No, good Sir Toby.
[Singing] His eyes do show that his life is almost over.
Is this really happening?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Singing] But I will never die.
[Singing] Sir Toby, that's a lie.
This isn't helping your case.
[Singing] Should I tell him to go?
[Singing] And what if you do?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Singing] Should I tell him to go, and not spare his feelings?
[Singing] Oh no, no, no, no, don't you dare.
You're out of tune, sir. You lie. [To MALVOLIO] You're nothing more than a steward. Do you think that just because you are boring and virtuous, food and wine will disappear?
By Saint Anne, we'll have spiced ale too.
You've got the right idea. [To MALVOLIO] Go rub your steward's chain in some crumbs, sir. Maria, bring us more wine!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Miss Maria, if you care at all about Lady Olivia's approval, then you won't bring more wine and contribute to this boorish behavior. She'll hear about this—I'll tell her.
Go wiggle your donkey's ears.
Making a fool out of that man would be as virtuous a deed as giving wine to the thirsty. I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up—that might work.
Do it, knight. I'll write a letter challenging him on your behalf. Or I'll tell him your insults myself.
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Ever since the Duke's young messenger visited Lady Olivia, she's been in a strange mood. And as for Mister Malvolio, let me take care of him. If I can't trick him into making a fool of himself and turn him into a big joke, then I'm not even smart enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can do it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give us the facts, give us the facts—tell us something about him.
Well, sir, sometimes he acts like a Puritan—opposed to anything fun.
Oh, I'd beat him like a dog for that!
What, for being a Puritan? And what's your far-fetched reason for that, dear knight?
I don't have a far-fetched reason for it, but my reason is good enough.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He's not always a Puritan, though. He doesn't remain anything for long, except for a flatterer and a yes-man, an affected jackass who tries to talk like the nobility. He has such a high opinion of himself and thinks he's so crammed full of excellent qualities that he's sure everyone loves him. And that's the weakness that I'll use to get my revenge on him.
What will you do?
I'll drop some mysterious love letters in his path. They'll describe the color of his beard, the shape of his legs, the way he walks, and the expression of his eyes, forehead, and complexion—so he'll be sure that they're addressed to him. I can make my handwriting look just like your niece Lady Olivia's. Sometimes we can't tell our writing apart.
Excellent! I can smell the trick.
I smell it too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He'll think, based on the letters you drop, that they come from my niece, and assume that she's in love with him.
My purpose is indeed a horse of that color, so to speak.
And your horse would now make him into a jackass.
Yes, you jackass.
Oh, it's going to be great!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It will be royal fun, I promise you. I know my medicine will work on him. You two will hide, along with the Fool, in the place where I'll leave the letter. Then you can observe how he interprets it. But for tonight, it's time to go to bed and dream about this plan. Farewell.
Good night, queen of the Amazons.
She's a good wench—I swear.
She's a little purebred hunting hound, and she adores me. What of it?
Someone once adored me, too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let's go to bed, knight. You need to send for some more money.
If I don't marry your niece, then I'm going to be in horrible financial trouble.
Send for more money, knight. If you don't end up with her in the end, then I'm a fool.
If I don't, never trust me again—interpret that how you want to.
Come, come, I'll go warm up some sherry for us. It's too late to go to bed now. Come, knight. Come, knight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me some music. [Music plays] Now, good morning, friends. [To VIOLA]  Now, good Cesario, have them play that old-fashioned song we heard last night. It helped ease my passion and made me feel better, more than the silly songs and memorized words of these fast-paced modern times. Come, have them sing just one verse at least.
Forgive me, my lord, but the man who should sing it isn't here.
Who is that?
Feste the jester, my lord, a fool that Olivia's father used to like. He's somewhere in the house.
Go find him, and in the meantime you all play the tune.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To VIOLA] Come here, boy. If you ever fall in love, remember me when you feel its bittersweet pangs. Because the way I am now is the way all true lovers are—moody and fickle in every emotion, constant only in imagining the face of the person they love. How do you like this song?
It echoes poignantly in the heart.
You speak well. I'd bet my life that, young as you are, you've fallen in love with a woman before. Am I right, boy?
A little bit, sir.
What kind of woman is she?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She looks something like you.
She's not worthy of you, then. How old is she?
About your age, my lord.
Then she's too old, by heaven. A woman should be with a man older than she is, so she can adapt herself to her husband and keep his love constant. We men praise ourselves, boy, but in reality we are more fickle and inconstant in love than women are—our desires waver and disappear sooner and more frequently.
I think you're right, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then your beloved should be younger than you are, or you won't be able to maintain your feelings for her. Women are like roses, whose beauty is greatest in the same hour that they fall from the stem and decay.
So they are. It's too bad that this is how it is—beauty starts to die just as it reaches its perfection!
Oh, you fellow, come sing the song we heard last night. Listen closely to it, Cesario, it's a simple old song. The wool spinners and knitters used to sing it while they sewed, and innocent maidens recited it over their weaving. It tells the simple truth about the innocence of love, as it was in the good old days.
Are you ready, sir?
Yes; please, sing.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Singing]Come now, come now death,And let me be laid in a cypress coffin.Fly away, fly away breath,I've been killed by a fair, cruel girl.My shroud of white, adorned with yew sprigs,Oh, prepare it for me!No one as faithful as IHas ever died like me.Throw no flowers, no sweet flowersUpon my black coffin.Let no friends, no friends seeMy poor corpse, or my scattered bones.Save your thousand sighs of mourning,And bury me, Oh, whereNo sad true lovers can find my grave,To weep there!
[Giving the FOOL money] That's for your trouble.
It was no trouble, sir. I take pleasure in singing, sir.
I'll pay you for your pleasure, then.
All right then, sir. We all pay for our pleasures eventually.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Allow me to let you leave now.
May the god of melancholy watch over you, and may a tailor make you a jacket of opal, for your mind changes like the colors of an opal. Men as changeable as you should be put out to sea, where they can make everything their business and scatter their ideas everywhere, drifting about on the changeable waves—that's how you make a good voyage out of nothing. Farewell.
The rest of you can leave too.
Once more, Cesario, go visit that supremely cruel woman. Tell her that my love is more noble than anything else in the world, and has nothing to do with her property or the riches she has inherited. Tell her that the fortune I value the most is her gem-like beauty, which is priceless and attracts my helpless soul.
But if she cannot love you, sir?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I cannot accept that answer.
Truly, but you must. Imagine a lady—who probably exists somewhere—who loves you just as passionately as you love Olivia. But you cannot love her, and you tell her so. Doesn't she have to accept your answer then?
There is no woman strong enough to withstand the passion of love that's in my heart. No woman's heart is big enough to hold so much emotion. Women can't carry too much. Alas, love for them is just a shallow appetite—a matter of taste, not a matter of the heart. If they try to eat too much, they get sick, but my love is as insatiable as the sea, and can swallow just as much as the ocean. Don't compare my love for Olivia to any love a woman could have for me.
Yes, but I know—
What do you know?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know too well how strongly a woman can love a man. Really, their hearts are as true as ours are. My father had a daughter who loved a man just as strongly as I might love you, if I were a woman.
And what's her story?
Her story is blank, my lord. She never spoke of her love, but kept her passion concealed. It tormented her from the inside, like a worm trapped inside a closed flower bud, and fed on her outer beauty until it faded. She pined away quietly and sadly, and sat like a sculpture of patience itself, smiling despite her grief. Now wasn't this true love? We men might say more and promise more, but indeed our words are stronger than our passions. We are good at making vows of love, but worse at keeping them.
But did your sister die of her love, my boy?
I am all of my father's daughters, and all of his sons too—and yet I'm not certain of that. Sir, should I go see this lady then?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, that's right. Go to her quickly. Give her this jewel. Say that my love cannot yield, and cannot be denied. [He hands her a jewel]
Come along, Mister Fabian.
I'm coming, don't worry. If I miss the tiniest bit of this joke, may I get boiled to death.
Won't you be glad to see that pretentious, rascally dog get humiliated?
I'll rejoice, man. You know, he got me in trouble with my lady Olivia once, when I held a bear-baiting here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We'll bring the bear back just to make him angry then, and we'll make a fool of him until he's ruined. Won't we, Sir Andrew?
If we don't, it will be the worst mistake of our lives.
Here comes the little villain.
How's it going, my golden one?
All three of you hide in the hedge. Malvolio's coming this way down the path. He's been over there practicing his elegant manner for the past half hour. Watch him closely, if you love mockery, because I know that this letter will turn him into a starry-eyed fool. Now hide, if you love jokes!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You lie there now [Maria throws down a letter], for here comes the fish that must be caught by tickling it.
All is luck, only luck. Maria once told me that Lady Olivia liked me, and I've almost heard Olivia herself say that if she should love a man, he would be someone with my personality. Besides, she treats me with more respect and admiration than anyone else in her service. So what should I think of all this?
[Whispering so MALVOLIO can't hear] What an arrogant villain!
[Whispering] Oh, gimme a break! When he's alone and musing to himself he acts even more like a proud peacock. See how he struts and shows his feathers!
[Whispering] By God, I'd like to beat him up!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Whispering] Quiet, I say.
I could be "Count Malvolio!"
[Whispering] Ah, that villain!
[Whispering] Somebody shoot him, just shoot him.
[Whispering] Quiet, quiet!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There are other instances of such things happening. The Lady Strachy married her wardrobe assistant.
[Whispering] Curse him, wicked Jezebel!
[Whispering] Oh, quiet! Now he's really lost in his imagination. Look how his fantasies puff him up.
Imagine me after three months being married to her, sitting in my majestic chair—
[Whispering] Oh, if only I had a slingshot, to shoot him in the eye!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Calling my servants around me, dressed in my embroidered velvet gown, having just come from the sofa where I've left Olivia sleeping—
[Whispering] Bloody hell!
hispering] Oh quiet, quiet!
And then to have an expression of great authority, and to gravely survey the room and then tell them that I know my place, and I'd like them to know theirs. I'd ask for my cousin Toby—
[Whispering] My God!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Whispering] Oh quiet, quiet, quiet! Now, now.
Seven of my servants obediently would go to find him. I frown while I wait, and perhaps wind my watch, or play with my—with some rich jewel I'm wearing. Toby approaches me and bows—
[Whispering] Will we let this fellow live?
[Whispering] We must keep our silence—even though it is hard to, when he's being this offensive. Quiet.
I reach out my hand to him like so, extinguishing my usual smile and replacing it with a severe look of authority—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Whispering] And doesn't Toby give you a punch in the mouth then?
And I say, "Cousin Toby, since fortune has allowed me to marry your niece, I have the right to say this—"
[Whispering] What, what?
"You must give up your drinking."
[Whispering] Out of here, you scab!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Whispering] No, be patient, or we'll ruin our plan.
"And another thing—you're wasting your valuable time with that foolish knight—"
[Whispering]That's me, I'm sure.
"That Sir Andrew—"
[Whispering] I knew it was me, for I've often been called foolish.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Seeing the letter] And what do we have here?
[Whispering] Now the bird approaches the snare.
[Whispering] Oh, quiet! I hope the mood strikes him to read it out loud!
[Picking up the letter] By God, this is my lady's handwriting—these are her C's, her U's, and her T's, and this is how she makes her big P's. It's her handwriting, without question.
[Whispering] Her C's, her U's, and her T's. Why only mention those?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Reading] "To my beloved, who doesn't know of my love, I send this letter and my good wishes"—And it's phrased just how she would speak! Excuse me for breaking your seal, wax. But wait! This wax is stamped with an image of Lucrece, which Olivia uses for her seal. This letter is from my lady. But who is it written to?
[Whispering] This is winning him over, heart and all.
[Reading]"God knows that I love,But who!Lips, do not speak;No man must know.""No man must know." But what's next? The poem's meter changes. "No man must know." What if she's writing about you, Malvolio?
[Whispering] Damn, go hang yourself, you badger!
[Reading]"I may command the one I love,But silence, like a knife,Cuts my heart with a bloodless wound.M.O.A.I. rules my life."
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Whispering] An elaborate riddle!
[Whispering] Such a clever girl, I say.
"M.O.A.I. rules my life." No, but first, let me see, let me see, let me see.
[Whispering] What a dish of poison she's prepared for him!
[Whispering] And see how eagerly he goes to eat it!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* "I may command the one I love." Well, she may command me. I am her servant, and she is my lady. This much is easy for anyone to figure out. There's no difficulty here. But the end—what do those letters mean? If only I could make them refer to me—wait! M.O.A.I.—
[Whispering] Oh, yes, notice that. The trail's gone cold for him.
[Whispering] He'll pick up the scent eventually, no matter how much it smells of a prank.
"M"—Malvolio. "M"—why, that's the first letter of my name.
[Whispering] Didn't I say he would figure it out? This dog is excellent at tracking.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* "M." But then the next letter doesn't agree with my name. This theory doesn't stand up to the test. "A" should be next, but instead it's "O."
[Whispering] And this will all end in an "O" as well, I hope—the "O" of a hangman's noose.
[Whispering] Yes, or else I'll beat him with a club and make him yell "O!"
And then an "I" comes last.
[Whispering] Yes, and if you had an "I" in the back of your head, you might see more trouble behind you than good luck before you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* "M.O.A.I." The hidden meaning of this part isn't like the other one, but if I force it a little, it too could refer to me—for every one of these letters is in my name. Wait, there's some more prose now.[Reading]"If this should fall into your hands, consider it well. By birth I am ranked above you, but don't be afraid of my greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. Your fate welcomes you. Accept it with your body and spirit. And, to prepare yourself for the upper-class life you will have soon, cast aside your lowly outer self and become a new, fresh person. Be rude to your companions, and be mean to servants. Talk loudly and often about politics, and make a habit of being unique and eccentric. The woman who sighs with love for you advises you to do this. Remember who it was who complimented your yellow stockings, and asked to see you always wearing crossed laces going up your legs. Remember her, I say. Now go. You are assured of becoming a gentleman, if you want to be. If not, just keep acting like a steward, a companion of servants, and not worthy to grasp the greatness before you. Farewell. Signed, one who would switch places with you and be your servant,The Fortunate Unfortunate"Daylight in an open field couldn't be clearer than this. This is obvious. I will act proud, I will study politics, I will insult Sir Toby, I will rid myself of lower-class acquaintances, and I will act exactly as she asked me to. I'm not fooling myself now, or letting my imagination trick me—reason points to the inevitable conclusion that my lady Olivia loves me. She did compliment my yellow stockings lately, and she did praise my crossed laces, and in this she has proven that she loves me. I thank my lucky stars. I'm so happy. I will act just as she wanted—I'll be proud and aloof, and put on my yellow stockings and crossed laces as quickly as I can. May God and my lucky stars be praised! And here's more, a postscript.[Reading]"You have probably figured out who I am. If you accept my love, then let me know by smiling. Your smiles look good on you. So please smile whenever you're in my presence, my dear sweetheart."Thank you God! I will smile for her. I'll do everything she wants me to.
I wouldn't have missed this entertainment for a pension of thousands, to be paid by the Shah of Persia.
I could marry that Maria for coming up with this scheme.
So could I.
And I wouldn't ask for any bridal dowry except for her to come up with another joke like this.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Neither would I.
Here comes my noble fool-catcher.
Should I kiss your feet?
Or should I?
Should I gamble away my freedom at dice, and become your slave?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Or should I?
Why, you've sent Malvolio into such a fantasy that he'll go mad when he learns the truth.
No, tell me the truth, did he fall for my letter?
He swallowed it hook, line, and sinker.
If you want to see the real results of this joke, then watch him when he first approaches my lady. He'll come to her in yellow stockings—a color she hates—and with crossed laces on his legs—a fashion she despises. And he'll smile constantly at her, which will go completely against her current mood, as she seems addicted to melancholy lately. All of it together will surely make her notice him and scorn him. If you want to see this, follow me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll follow you to the deepest gates of Hell, you witty devil!
I'll join the group too.
God bless you, friend, and your music. Do you make your living by playing your drum?
No, sir, I live by the church.
Are you a clergyman?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not at all, sir. I live by the church because I live in my house, and my house is by the church.
You may as well say then that the king sleeps with a beggar if a beggar lives near him, or that the church stands next to your drum if your drum stands next to the church.
You're right, sir. What a wonder this modern age is! A sentence is like a supple glove for good wit—it can be turned inside out so quickly!
Yes, that's certainly true. Those who play around with words too much can quickly make them changeable and promiscuous.
If that's so, then I wish my sister didn't have a name, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, man?
Well, sir, her name's a word, and to play around with that word might make my sister promiscuous. But indeed, words have been rascals ever since people started needing written contracts to guarantee them.
What's your reason for that, man?
Truly, sir, I can't give you a reason without using words, and since words have become so false and unreliable, I'm hesitant to use them for my proof.
I'll bet you're a happy fellow, without a care in the world.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not so, sir, I do care for something. But honestly, sir, I don't care for you. If that means that I care for nothing, sir, then you should become invisible right now—as you're nothing.
Aren't you the Lady Olivia's fool?
No indeed, sir, the Lady Olivia has no foolishness. She won't keep a fool until she gets married. Fools are to husbands as anchovies are to sardines—husbands are the larger version. I'm not her fool, just her corrupter of words.
I saw you at Duke Orsino's recently.
Foolishness, sir, wanders about the earth like the sun. It's everywhere. I'd be sorry if your master was less acquainted with foolishness than my mistress is. I think I saw you there, you wise man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you're just going to make fun of me, I want nothing to do with it. But wait, here's a coin for you.
May God, in his next shipment of hair, send you a beard!
Honestly, I'm telling you, I'm dying for one, [To herself] though I don't want it on my own chin—I'm dying for a certain man with a beard.[To the FOOL] Is Lady Olivia inside?
If I had a pair of these coins, sir, do you think they'd have children?
Yes, if they were kept together and invested.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'd like to play the pimp, sir, and bring these two lovers together.
[Giving him money] I understand you sir. You're pretty good at begging.
It's no problem for me, sir, as I'm only begging on a beggar's behalf. The famous lover Cressida became a beggar in her old age, they say. My lady is inside, sir. I'll explain where you come from, but who you are and what you want are beyond my knowledge. I'd say I'm "not in my element," but those words are overused.
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool, and to do that well you have to be clever. He has to pay attention to the mood and status of the person he's mocking, the time, and must also pursue every target he sees. This is a skill that requires just as much work as any wise man's job, for he plays the fool very wisely. Wise men, on the other hand, ruin their reputation for intelligence when they try to play the fool.
God bless you, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And you, sir.
[Speaking in French] May God protect you, sir.
[Speaking in French] And you also. At your service!
I hope so, sir, and I am at your service too.
Will you come in the house? My niece wants you to, if your business is with her.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'm bound for your niece, sir. I mean, she's the destination of my voyage.
Try your legs then sir, and put them in motion.
My legs stand under me better than I understand you, and what you mean by "try your legs."
I mean to enter the house, sir.
I'll answer you by walking in. But we've been anticipated.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most excellent accomplished lady, may the heavens rain odors upon you!
[To himself] That youth's a classy fellow. "Rain odors." Nice.
My message can't be told to anyone, my lady. It's only for your own willing and receptive ears.
[To himself) "Odors," "willing," and "receptive." I'll have to remember those.
Close the garden door and let me be alone to hear this message.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me your hand, sir.
I offer you my obedience, madam, and my most humble service.
What is your name?
Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
My servant, sir! The world has gone downhill since false humility started passing for a compliment. You're Duke Orsino's servant, youth, not mine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But he is your servant, so all that he has is yours too. Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
As for him, I don't think about him. And as for his thoughts, I wish that they were blank pages instead of filled with pictures of me.
Madam, I've come on his behalf to improve your feelings towards him.
Oh, please, I beg you, I asked you never speak of him again. But if you would tell me that another man loves me instead, I would rather hear that than angels singing.
Dear lady—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Please, let me speak. After the magic spell you cast on me last time you were here, I sent that ring to you. With that trick I degraded myself, my servant, and you, I'm afraid. I must then accept your judgment of this act, which you probably condemn—for I forced that ring on you through shameful trickery, and without your consent. What must you think of me? Haven't you tied my honor to a stake like a bear, and let the hounds of your anger attack it? But I've shown my situation clearly enough for someone of your intelligence to understand. My heart's on my sleeve—I can't hide my passion. So let me hear you speak.
I pity you.
That's a step towards love.
No, not a step. It's a common experience that we often pity our enemies.
Then I think it's time for me to smile again. Oh, how easy it is for the poor to be proud of something they don't have! But if I must be defeated, then better to be defeated by a noble enemy than a lowly one.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* See, the clock scolds me for wasting time. Don't worry, youth, I won't keep pursuing you. And when you're older and wiser, your future wife will have a fine handsome husband. There's your way back home, due west.
Then I'm off to the west! I wish you the best of fortune. You don't have a message for the duke?
Stay, please, and tell me what you really think of me.
I think that you're not who you think you are.
If that's true, then I think the same thing of you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then you're correct. I am not what I seem to be.
I wish you were what I want you to be!
Would that be better, madam, than me being what I am? I wish that it would, for right now I'm a fool.
[To herself] Oh, look how beautiful he is even in his anger and contempt! A murderer's guilt is easier to hide than feelings of love. Midday is like nighttime for love—that's how brightly passion shines. [To VIOLA] Cesario, I swear by the roses of spring, by virginity, by honor, by truth, and by everything, that I love you. I love you so much that neither my wit nor my reason can hide my passion, despite your pride. Don't draw the wrong conclusions from this, though—just because I'm wooing you doesn't mean you shouldn't woo me. Use your better logic and see that love asked for is good, but love freely given is better.
And I swear by innocence and by my own youth that I have only one heart and one love to give, and no woman has ever ruled them, and never will—except for myself. And so I'll say farewell, good madam. I'll never again try to make you pity my master's passion.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But come again, for you might still convince my heart, which hates him now, to somehow accept his love.
No, really, I won't stay a moment longer.
What's your reason for leaving, my bitter friend?
Yes, you must tell us your reason, Sir Andrew.
Well, I saw your niece Olivia treating the Duke's messenger better than she has ever treated me. I saw it in the garden.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Did she see you at the time though, old boy? Tell me that.
Yes, she saw me as plainly as I see you now.
Then that was proof that she loves you.
What, are trying to make a fool of me?
I'll prove it to be true, sir, with judgment and logic.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And judgment and logic have been wise jury members since the time of Noah's ark.
She treated the youth so well while you were watching to exasperate and anger you, to wake up your meekly sleeping boldness, to fire up your passions. You should have approached her that minute, whipped out some excellent jokes you invented right there on the spot, and humiliated the youth into silence. That was the opening she gave you, but you missed it. This was a golden opportunity for you, but you let it slip away, and now you've sailed out of the warmth of my lady's good opinion. You'll stay there like an icicle in a sailor's beard unless you can redeem yourself to her through some noble act of bravery or politics.
If I have to do something, it must be something brave, for I hate politics. I'd rather be a heretic than a politician.
Well then, improve your fortunes through your bravery. Challenge the duke's young servant to a fight. Hurt him in eleven places. My niece will notice this, and let me assure you, no matchmaker in the world can win you a woman's love like a reputation for bravery can.
This is the only way, Sir Andrew.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will either of you deliver the message of my challenge to him?
Go and write it down, in fierce handwriting. Be rude and brief. It doesn't need to be witty, as long as it's eloquent and original. Taunt him with all the possibilities of writing. Refer to him familiarly three times at least, which will insult his pride as a nobleman. As many lies as you can fit on a piece of paper—even if the paper's as big as a royal bed—write 'em all down. Go, get started now. Even if you're using an ordinary pen, you can still fill it with bitter, venomous ink. Now go ahead.
Where will I find you when I'm done?
We'll meet you in the little room. Now go.
This knight is a beloved puppet to you, Sir Toby.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And I've been a beloved expense to him, as he's spent two thousand or so of his ducats on me.
His letter's sure to be a work of art. But you won't deliver it, will you?
Never trust me again if I don't. And by all means encourage the youth to answer the knight's challenge. An oxcart couldn't haul them close enough together to fight. As for Andrew, if you dissected him and found enough red blood in his liver for even a flea to notice, I'd eat the rest of his body. He's a coward through and through.
And his opponent, the youth, doesn't seem to have much aggression in his face either.
Look, here comes the smallest bird of all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you want to have a laughing fit, and really laugh until you split your sides, then follow me. That gullible Malvolio must have renounced Christianity, for no Christian who intends to go to heaven by his faith could ever believe the absurd, exaggerated things like we put in that letter. He's wearing yellow stockings.
With crossed laces?
Yes, and they look awful—like an unfashionable village schoolteacher. I've been stalking him like a murderer, and he's followed every instruction I gave in that letter I dropped. He smiles so much that his face has more lines in it than a map of the Indies. You've never seen anything like this. I can hardly keep from throwing things at him. I know my lady will get so annoyed she'll hit him eventually, and when she does, he'll just smile and imagine that she's flattering him.
Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
I didn't want to trouble you, but you seem to take pleasure in enduring suffering, so I won't scold you about it anymore.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I couldn't stay behind. My desire to go was sharper than a knife, and it spurred me onward. It wasn't just love for you, though that much might have inspired a man to go on an even longer voyage. I was also worried about what might happen to you in your travels, since you don't know this area, and it can be rough and inhospitable to a stranger without a guide or friend. My willing love for you, combined with these fears for your safety, drove me to follow you.
My kind Antonio, the only answer I can give you is thanks, and thanks, and infinite thanks. Often such good deeds are only rewarded with cheap words, but if I had any wealth I would strengthen my gratitude with money. Now what should we do? Should we go see the monuments of this town?
We'll do that tomorrow, sir. First we should find a place for you to stay.
I'm not weary, and night is a long way away. Please, let's go satisfy our eyes with the sight of the memorials and statues that make this city famous.
I hope you'll pardon me: I can't walk these streets without being in danger. Once in a battle at sea I served on the side fighting against Duke Orsino's ships, and I distinguished myself enough that I might be recognized. If I were arrested here, they'd make me answer for my deeds.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then you must have killed many of his men?
My deeds weren't so bloody as that, though we had just cause to shed some blood over that quarrel. We could have since resolved the matter by paying reparations for the damage we did to them in battle, for the sake of maintaining our trade relations. Most of our city did. I was the only one who refused to pay anything. That's why I'll pay dearly if I should be cap here.
Then don't walk around too conspicuously.
It's not a good idea for me, certainly. Wait, sir, here's my purse. [Giving SEBASTIAN some money] The best place to stay is an inn called the Elephant. It's in the suburbs to the south. I'll order our meals while you spend your time pleasantly and educate yourself by exploring the town. You can find me back at the Elephant.
Why should I take your purse, though?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Just if some trinket should catch your eye and you want to buy it—I have the feeling that your store of money isn't large enough for useless purchases.
I'll carry your purse then, and leave you for an hour.
And meet me at the Elephant.
I remember.
[To herself] I've sent for him. He says he'll come. What food should I give him? What gifts? For it's better to buy something than beg for it or borrow it—and it's the same with youth and love. But I'm speaking too loud. [To MARIA] Where's Malvolio? He is very serious and solemn, which is appropriate for someone in mourning like I am. Where is Malvolio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He's coming, madam, but in a very strange manner. He seems crazy, madam.
Why, what's the matter? Is he talking nonsense?
No, madam, he does nothing but smile. It would be best if you had a guard nearby if he comes here, for the man is surely sick in his head.
Go call him here.
I am as mad as he is, if sad madness and merry madness are equals.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What's going on, Malvolio?
Sweet lady, hello.
Are you smiling? I sent for you on a sad occasion.
Sad, my lady! I could be sad. These crossed laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit, but what of that? If a certain person likes them, then it's like that poem says: "Please one, and please all."
Why, what's going on, man? What is the matter with you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My legs are yellow, but I don't feel blue. The letter came to me, and its commands must be obeyed. I think I recognized the fancy Italian handwriting.
Don't you think you ought to go to bed, Malvolio?
To bed? "Yes, sweetheart, I'll come to you."
For God's sake! Why are you smiling like that, and kissing your hand so often?
Are you okay, Malvolio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You think I'll answer you? Noblemen don't answer servants!
Why are you acting with such ridiculous arrogance in front of my lady?
"Don't be afraid of my greatness." It was well written.
What do you mean by that, Malvolio?
"Some are born great—"
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What?
"Some achieve greatness—"
What did you say?
"And some have greatness thrust upon them."
May heaven restore your sanity!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* "Remember who it was who complimented your yellow stockings—"
Your yellow stockings?
"And asked to see you always wearing crossed laces going up your legs."
Crossed laces?
"Now go. You are assured of becoming a gentleman, if you want to be—"
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Am I a gentleman?
"If not, just keep acting like a servant."
This is surely insanity.
Madam, Duke Orsino's young gentleman has returned. I had to beg him to come back, but he is here now and ready to see you when you're ready.
I'll go to him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good Maria, take care of this fellow here. Where's my cousin Toby? Let some of my servants take special care of Malvolio. I'd give half my wealth to keep him from harm.
Oh ho! Do you see me now? Sir Toby himself has been told to take care of me. This fits exactly with the letter. She sends Sir Toby to me on purpose so that I can be rude to him, just as she told me to in the letter. "Cast aside your lowly outer self," she said. "Be rude to your companions, and be mean to servants. Talk loudly and often about politics, and make a habit of being unique and eccentric." And then she wrote down the ways I should go about this: I should have a solemn face and a dignified demeanor, speak slowly, dress like a distinguished gentleman, and so forth. I've caught her now, but it is really God's doing—and may God make me thankful! And when she went away just now, she said "take care of this fellow here." "Fellow!" Not "Malvolio," nor anything appropriate for a servant, but "fellow." Almost "companion" or "partner." Why, everything is coming together perfectly, and not the tiniest amount of doubt, no obstacle, no incredible or unfortunate event could ruin it—what else can be said? Nothing that exists can now come between me and the fulfillment of my hopes. Well, God is responsible for this, not me, and he is to be thanked.
Where is he, in the name of all that's holy? Even if all the devils of hell are crammed together inside of him, even if a troop of demons possesses him, I still want to speak to him.
Here he is, here he is. How are you, sir? How are you feeling, man?
Go away, I cast you off. Let me enjoy my privacy. Go away.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To SIR TOBY BELCH] Oh my, the demon speaks so loudly from within him. Didn't I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady asks you to take care of him.
Aha! Does she?
[To FABIAN and MARIA] Come on, come on! Quiet, quiet. We must be gentle with him. Let me deal with this. [To MALVOLIO] How are you, Malvolio? How are you feeling? Come on, man, renounce the devil! Remember, he's the enemy of mankind.
Do you know what you're saying?
[To SIR TOBY BELCH] Look, he resents it when you insult the devil! Pray to God that he's not bewitched!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Get a urine sample from him and take it to the healing woman.
Sure, I'll do it tomorrow morning, I swear. My lady would give a lot to keep from losing him.
What's that, mistress?
Oh Lord!
[To MARIA] Please, keep quiet. This isn't the way to go about it. Don't you see that you're making him upset? Leave me alone with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The only way to deal with him is gently, gently. The demon in him is rough, but we can't treat it roughly.
[To the demon possessing MALVOLIO] Why, hello, my fine fellow! How are you, little chicken?
Sir!
[To the devil "possessing" MALVOLIO] Yes, little chicken, come with me. [To MALVOLIO] What, man! You're too serious to play games with Satan. Damn him, that dirty coal miner devil!
Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My prayers, you hussy?
[To SIR TOBY BELCH] No, I'm telling you, he doesn't want to hear about God.
Go hang yourselves, all of you! You are lazy, shallow creatures. I'm made of better stuff than you. You'll learn more about that, later.
Is it possible?
If this were being acted out on a stage, I would complain that it was unrealistic.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He's really taken our trick to heart—it seems to have infected his very soul.
No, pursue him now, before he exposes the prank and it gets ruined.
Why, we're really going to make him crazy.
The house will be a calmer place for it.
Come, we'll get him into a madhouse soon enough. My niece already thinks that he's crazy. We can take it as far as we want, punishing him and having fun, until we're tired and out of breath from laughing so hard, and then we can have mercy on him and reveal the joke, and crown you, Maria, the prank's mastermind. Come on, come on!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here's more material for our comedy.
[Presenting a paper] Here's my challenge; read it. I promise that it's feisty enough.
Is it that insulting?
Yes, it is, I promise. Just read it.
Give it to me. [Reading] "Youth, whatever you are, you're nothing but a filthy fellow."
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good, and brave.
[Reading] "And don't be amazed or ask why I call you that, for I won't give you any reason for it."
Good job, that vagueness will keep you from being accused of slander.
[Reading] "You came to the lady Olivia, and she was kind to you in front of me. But you lie like a dog. That's not what I'm challenging you about."
Very brief, and full of good sense... or nonsense.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Reading] "I will ambush you on your way home, and if you happen to kill me there—"
Good.
[Reading] "You'll be killing me like a criminal and a villain."
You're still keeping on the safe side of the law. Good.
[Reading] "Farewell then, and may God have mercy upon one of our souls. He may have mercy upon mine, but my hope of surviving is better than yours, so watch yourself. Signed, your friend, if you were friendly in return, and your sworn enemy,Andrew Aguecheek"[To ANDREW] If this letter won't make him get up and fight, then his legs must not work. I'll give it to him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You have a very convenient opportunity for it. He's doing some business with my lady right now, and he'll be leaving sooner or later.
Go, Sir Andrew. Look for him in the corner of the garden as if you were a bounty hunter. As soon as you see him, draw your sword, and swear horribly as you draw it. It's often the case that a terrible swear word uttered with an arrogant tone can increase your reputation for courage better than actually fighting would. Now go!
No, I can't bear to swear.
Now I won't deliver this letter, for the young gentleman's behavior shows that he is noble and sensible, and his role as a messenger between his lord and my niece confirms this. Therefore this letter, which is so incredibly ignorant, won't frighten him at all. He'll know it came from a fool. But, sir, I will deliver Sir Andrew's challenge by word of mouth. I'll describe him as having a great reputation for bravery, and convince the youth that Sir Andrew is angry, courageous, and skilled with a sword—and he'll believe me because he's so young. Then they'll both be so afraid, that when they see each other they'll kill each other with just a look, like basilisks.
Here comes the youth with your niece. Stay away until he leaves her, and then confront him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* While I wait I'll come up with some horrible message to be the challenge.
I've said too much to your heart of stone, and carelessly laid my honor and reputation on that stone. There's something in me that condemns my love, but that love is so willful and powerful that it ignores all condemnation.
My master's behavior in his passion for you is the same as yours in your passion for me.
Here, wear this locket for me. My picture is inside. Don't refuse it, please. Unlike me, it has no voice to upset you with. And I beg you to come again tomorrow. What could you ask of me that I would deny, as long as I can retain my honor in giving it?
Nothing but this: give your true love to my master.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How could I keep my honor and  give him what I have already given to you?
I will release you from any obligation to me.
Well, come again tomorrow. Farewell. A devil who wore your face could lead my soul to hell.
Hello, gentleman.
And hello to you, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Prepare yourself with whatever fighting defenses you have. I don't know what you've done to insult him, but someone is full of defiance and bloodthirstiness towards you, and he waits for you at the end of the garden. Draw your sword and prepare yourself swiftly, for your assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.
You must be mistaken, sir. I'm sure no man has any reason to quarrel with me. I can't remember ever offending anyone.
You'll find the truth to be otherwise, I assure you. So if you value your life at all, be on your guard, for your opponent has all the youth, strength, skill, and anger that God can give to a man.
Please, sir, who is he?
He is a knight. His sword has never been used in battle, and he was knighted through his court connections rather than his battle skill, but he's a devil when he's fighting a private duel. He's killed three people, and his anger is so great right now that the only thing he'll be satisfied with is seeing you dead and buried. "Kill or be killed, it doesn't matter" is his motto.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll go back into the house and ask for a protective escort from the lady. I'm no fighter. I've heard of some men who pick fights with people on purpose, just to test their bravery. This man must have that kind of personality.
No, sir. His fury comes from a very real insult you gave him. So go ahead and give him what he wants. You won't be allowed to go back into the house unless you want to fight me, and if you're going to do that you might as well fight him instead. So go on to the garden, or else draw your sword right now. There's no way you're going to avoid a fight today, unless you want to give up your title as a gentleman and swear that you'll never carry a sword again.
This is as rude as it is strange. I beg you, please do me the favor of asking the knight how I've offended him. It must be something I've done without knowing it, not on purpose.
I will do so. Sir Fabian, stay with this gentleman until I return.
Please, sir, do you know anything about this matter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know the knight is furious with you, even to the degree of wanting a fight to the death, but I don't know any more details.
Please, what kind of man is he?
He doesn't look so great from the outside, but in fighting he always proves his bravery. Indeed, sir, he's the most skillful, bloodthirsty, and deadly opponent that you could find in all of Illyria. Will you go see him? I'll try to appease him for you if I can.
I'll be in your debt if you can do it. I'm a man who would rather deal with priests than with knights. I don't care if everyone knows that I'm not brave.
Why, man, he's a real devil. I've never seen such a virago. I fought a round with him, with real swords and all, and his thrusts and lunges are so deadly that defeat is inevitable. And when he strikes at you, he'll hit you as surely as your feet hit the ground they're standing on. They say that he used to fence for the Shah of Persia.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Damn my luck! I won't mess with him.
Yes, but now he can't be calmed down. Fabian can barely keep him from coming over here now.
Damn it, if I'd known that he was so brave and skilled at fighting, I wouldn't have challenged him in a million years. If he'll forget the whole matter, I'll give him my gray horse Capilet.
I'll make him the offer. Stand here and put on a brave face. We'll end this without anyone dying. [To himself] And I'll ride your horse just like I ride you.
[To FABIAN] He's offered his horse to settle the quarrel. I've persuaded him that the youth's a fighting devil.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The youth is just as afraid of Sir Andrew. He's pale and gasping, as if a bear were chasing him.
[To VIOLA] There's nothing to be done, sir; he still wants to fight you just because he swore that he would. But he's reconsidered his reasons for challenging you, and now realizes that they're so insignificant that they're not worth discussing. So draw your sword so that he can fulfill his promise. He promises he won't hurt you.
[To herself] May God defend me! Whatever insignificant insult I committed will now reveal just how unmanly I am.
Back off, if you see him get angry.
Come, Sir Andrew, there's nothing to be done. The gentleman insists on fighting one round with you for his honor's sake. The rules of dueling say he can't avoid it. But he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, that he won't hurt you. Come on, get to it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I pray to God that he keeps his promise!
I assure you, I wish none of this was happening.
Put away your sword. If this young gentleman has offended you, then let the blame pass to me. And if you've offended him, then I'll fight you on his behalf.
You, sir? Why, who are you?
I'm his friend, sir, and I would do more to you for his sake than whatever he might have said he would .
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, if you're someone who accepts challenges, then I'll challenge you.
Oh good Sir Toby, stop! Here come the officers.
[To ANTONIO] We'll continue this later.
[To ANDREW] Please, sir, put away your sword, please.
I will then, sir. And as for what I promised you, I'll be as good as my word. He is easy to ride, and responds well to the reins.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is the man. Do your duty.
Antonio, I arrest you on the orders of Duke Orsino.
You've mistaken me for someone else, sir.
No, sir, not a bit. I know your face well, even without a sailor's cap on your head. Take him away. He knows that I've recognized him.
I must obey. [To VIOLA] This happened because I was looking for you, but there's nothing to be done now. I'll answer for what I've done. But what will you do, now that I am forced to ask for my purse back? I feel worse about not being able to help you than I do about what's going to happen to me. You look confused, but don't worry about me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, sir, let's go.
[To VIOLA] I must ask you for some of that money.
What money, sir? I'll lend you what I can to thank you for the kindness you've shown me here, and because I pity your current troubles, but I don't have much. I'll divide my money with you. Here is half of all that I have. [Offering him money]
Will you really deny that you know me now? Is it possible that all I've done for you can't persuade you to help me? Don't make my misery even worse, or make me so angry that I list out all the kind things I've done for you.
I don't know of any kind thing you've done, and I don't know your voice or your face. I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying, vanity, babbling, drunkenness, or any other sin that corrupts our frail human blood—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh God!
Come on, sir, please, let's go.
Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here—I snatched him from the jaws of death and nursed him back to health with tenderness and love, and I thought that he seemed so noble and worthy that I totally devoted myself to him.
What do we care about that? You're wasting time. Let's go!
But oh, this god turned out to be a false idol! Sebastian, you have shamed your good looks. On the outside you seem perfect, but you are really a deformed monster because of your unkind soul. Virtue is beauty, but someone beautiful and evil is like an empty chest decorated by the devil.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The man is going mad. Take him away. Come on, come on, sir.
Lead me on.
His words are so passionate that he must believe what he's saying. But I can hardly believe it. Please be true, imagination, oh please be true—let it be true that I've been mistaken for you, my dear brother!
Come here, Sir Andrew. Come here, Fabian. We'll whisper together about some wise sayings.
He called me Sebastian. I have seen my brother when I look in my mirror. My brother looked like me, and now I'm dressed as he used to dress, in the same fashion, colors, and with the same accessories—because I imitated him in my disguise. Oh, if it's true, then storms are kind and the ocean is full of love!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What a dishonorable, puny boy, and more cowardly than a rabbit. He shows his dishonesty in abandoning his friend in his time of need, and denying that he even knew him. And as for his cowardice, ask Fabian.
He's a coward, a true coward, religiously devoted to his cowardice.
By God's eyelid, I'll go after him again and fight him.
Please do, beat him up well, but don't draw your sword.
And if I don't—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, let's go see what will happen.
I'll bet any money that nothing will happen—still.
Are you trying to convince me that I wasn't sent to fetch you?
Go away, go on, you're a foolish fellow. Leave me alone.
Good job keeping up this trick of yours—seriously. No, I don't know you, and my lady didn't send me to fetch you, and she doesn't want you to speak with her, and your name is not Master Cesario, and this isn't my nose, either. Nothing is what it is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Please, go spout your nonsense somewhere else. You don't know me.
Spout my nonsense? He must have heard that word used by some great man and now he applies it to a jester. Spout my nonsense! This foolish world, it turns out, is an effeminate dandy. Now please abandon your strange behavior and tell me what I should "spout" to my lady. Should I spout to her that you're coming?
Please, foolish jester, leave me alone. Here's some money for you. [Giving money] If you stay longer, I'll give you something worse.
I swear, you are a generous man. These wise men who give fools money will earn themselves a good reputation—after fourteen years of payments.
[To SEBASTIAN] Can this be, sir, that we meet again? Take that.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Striking him back] Well then, take that, and that, and that. Has everyone gone mad? [Draws his dagger]
Stop, sir, or I'll throw your dagger over the roof.
[To himself] I'll tell my lady about this straight away. She won't like anyone attacking Cesario—I wouldn't take money to be in some of your shoes.
[Grabbing SEBASTIAN] Come on, sir, stop!
No, leave him be. I'll get him in a different way. I'll sue him for assault and battery, if there's any justice and law in Illyria. I struck him first, but that shouldn't matter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To SIR TOBY BELCH] Let me go.
Come, sir, I won't let you go yet. Come on, my young soldier, put your weapon away. You've gotten excited by a taste of battle. Come on.
I will get free from you!
What will you do now? If you dare to try my patience further, then draw your sword.
What, what? No, for then I'd have to spill an ounce or two of your impudent blood.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stop, Toby! I command you to stop!
Madam!
Will it always be like this with you? You ungrateful wretch, you are only fit to live in the mountains and caves far from civilization, where good manners are unnecessary! Get out of my sight![To SEBASTIAN] Don't be offended, dear Cesario.[To TOBY]Go away, you brute!
Please, gentle friend, may your wisdom, not your passion, guide you through these uncivilized actions against you. Come with me to my house, and let me tell you about the many pointless practical jokes my beastly uncle has clumsily attempted, so you might come to laugh at this one. You mustn't leave. Don't deny me. Damn that Toby's soul! He startled my heart—my heart which lives in you.
[To himself] Something strange is going on. Where is all this leading? I must be mad, or else this is a dream. But if this is my imagination, then let me forget my sense of reality. And if dreaming is like this, then let me sleep!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now come, please. I wish you would take my advice!
Madam, I will.
Oh, say it, and do it too!
No, I'm telling you, put on this robe and beard. Make him believe that you're Sir Topas the priest. Do it quickly. I'll call Sir Toby while you're getting dressed.
Well, I'll put it on, and I'll disguise myself in it. If only I was the first person to play the hypocrite while wearing a priest's robe.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'm not tall enough to look like a real priest, nor skinny enough to look like a good student, but if you're known as an honest man and a good neighbor, then that's just as good as being dutiful and intelligent. Now here come my associates.
God bless you, Mr Priest.
Bonos dies, Sir Toby. As the old hermit of Prague, who never learned to read or write, said very wittily to a niece of King Gorboduc, "That which is, is." So if I'm Mr. Priest, then I'm Mr. Priest. For doesn't "that" just mean "that," and isn't "is" just "is?"
Go to him, Sir Topas.
[Disguising his voice] What's going on, I say! Quiet in this prison!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The fool is good at acting. A good fool.
[From offstage] Who's that calling?
Sir Topas the priest, who is here to visit Malvolio the lunatic.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, please go to my lady—
Out, you enormous devil!  See how you're hurting this man! Can't you talk about anything but ladies?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To himself] Well said, Mr. Priest.
Sir Topas, no man has ever been as badly treated as I have been. Good Sir Topas, don't believe that I'm mad. They've left me here in this horrible darkness.
Shame on you, dishonorable Satan! I address you with moderate language, for I'm one of those courteous people who will be polite even to the devil himself. Did you say that this house is dark?
Dark as hell, Sir Topas.
Why, it has bay windows as transparent as walls, and the upper windows facing toward the south-north are as clear as ebony. And you're complaining about darkness and a bad view?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'm not crazy, Sir Topas. I tell you that this house is dark.
You madman, you're wrong. I say that there's no darkness but ignorance, and you're more ignorant than the Egyptians during Moses' plague of fog.
And I say that this house is as dark as ignorance, and ignorance is as dark as hell. And I say that no man has ever been abused like I've been. I'm no more crazy than you are. Ask me any question and I'll prove my sanity.
What did the philosopher Pythagoras believe about wild birds?
That our grandmother's soul could end up inhabiting a bird.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What do you think of his belief?
I think that the soul is very noble, and I disagree with his belief.
Farewell then. Remain in the darkness. I won't declare you sane until you agree with Pythagoras, and fear to kill a pigeon because it might have the soul of your grandmother. Farewell.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
Perfect, Sir Topas!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, I can play many parts.
You might have done this without the robe and beard. He never saw you.
Go talk to him with your own voice, and tell me how he's feeling. I want this foolishness to be over soon. If we can conveniently let him go, I want to do it, for I'm now in so much trouble with my niece that I can't safely pursue this prank to its conclusion. Come to my room in a while.
[Singing in his own voice]Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,Tell me how your lady is.
Fool!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Singing] My lady is unkind indeed.
Fool!
[Singing] Alas, why is she like this?
Fool, I say!
[Singing] She loves another man—Who's that shouting?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good fool, I'll certainly reward you if you'll help me get a candle, a pen, ink, and paper. I swear on my word as a gentleman that I'll always be grateful to you for it.
Master Malvolio?
Yes, good fool.
Alas, sir, how did you lose your sanity?
Fool, no one has ever been abused like I've been. I'm just as sane as you are, Fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Just as sane as me? You must be crazy then, if you're no saner than a fool.
They've treated me like their property here, kept me in the darkness, sent their minions after me—those asses!—and done all they could to drive me insane by pretending I was insane.
Be careful what you say. The priest is here. [In the voice of Sir Topas] Malvolio, Malvolio, may God restore your sanity! Try to sleep, and stop your silly babbling.
Sir Topas!
[As Sir Topas] Don't try to talk to him, good fellow. [In his own voice] Who, me, sir? Not me, sir. God be with you, goodbye Sir Topas. [As Sir Topas] Amen. [In his own voice] Yes, sir, yes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fool, fool, fool, I say!
Alas, sir, be patient. What do you have to say, sir? I've just been scolded for speaking to you.
Good fool, please help me find a candle and some paper. I tell you, I'm as sane as any man in Illyria.
If only you were, sir.
I swear by my own hand, I am. Good fool, bring me some ink, paper, and light, and then deliver the letter I'll write to my lady. You'll be better rewarded for delivering this letter than you've ever been rewarded before.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll help you. But tell me the truth, are you really not crazy? Or are you just acting?
Believe me, I'm not crazy. I'm telling you the truth.
No, I'll never believe a madman until he's dead and I can see his brains. But I'll bring you a candle, and paper, and ink.
Fool, I'll repay you for this many times over. Now please, go.
[Singing]I am going, sir,But soon, sir,I'll be with you again,In just a moment,Like the old Vice,Who helps you in your time of need,With a wooden dagger,And his rage and wrath,Who shouts "Aha" to the devil,Like a mad boy,Yelling "Trim your nails, dad,And farewell, you peasant devil."
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is really the air, and that's really the glorious sun. Here's the pearl she gave me—I can feel it and see it. And though I'm full of amazement and confusion, I'm not crazy. But where's Antonio, then? I couldn't find him at the Elephant. But he had been there before me, and they told me that he was walking about the town and looking for me. His advice would be like gold to me right now. My soul makes the same strong argument as my senses, which is that all this is some mistake, but that I'm not crazy. Yet this mistake is such a sudden flood of good fortune, which exceeds all my expectations or possibility, that it makes me distrust my own eyes and wrestle with my reason, and suggests that maybe I am insane—or that the lady's insane. But if that were so, she wouldn't be able to run her house, command her servants, and take care of all her business affairs in the smooth, discreet, and stable way that she does. There's something deceptive going on here. But here comes the lady.
[To SEBASTIAN] Don't blame me for being so hasty. If you mean well, then come with me and this holy priest into the little chapel over there. There, before the priest and under that sacred roof, you can swear your everlasting love for me, make your marriage vows, and soothe my jealous and doubtful soul. The priest will keep it a secret until you're willing for it to be made public, and then we can have a full wedding ceremony and celebration that fits my social rank. What do you say?
I'll follow this good priest, and go with you; and once I've sworn to be faithful, I'll be faithful forever.
Then lead the way, good father; and may the sun shine brightly to recognize and bless this marriage.
Now, if you're really my friend, let me see his letter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good Master Fabian, do me a favor first.
Anything.
Don't ask to see this letter.
That request is like giving me a dog, and as payment asking for the dog back.
Are you in the service of the Lady Olivia, friends?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, sir, we are part of her entourage.
I know you well. How are you, my good fellow?
Truly, sir, I'm better because of my enemies, and worse because of my friends.
Don't you mean the opposite? You're better because of your friends.
No, sir, I'm worse.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How can that be?
Well, sir, my friends praise me and in so doing make a fool of me, while my enemies tell me plainly that I am a fool. Therefore my enemies help me gain knowledge of myself, while my friends deceive me. The same rule applies to both conclusions and kisses—since four negatives make two affirmatives, I'm worse because of my friends and better because of my enemies.
Why, this is excellent wordplay.
Truly sir, don't say so—unless you want to be one of my friends.
[Giving him a coin] You won't be worse off because of me: here's some gold.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I wish you'd deal me another coin, sir, but then it would be double-dealing, and therefore dishonorable.
Oh, you're giving me bad advice.
Put your virtue away just this once, sir, and let your human weakness take my advice.
Well I'll be a sinner then, and a double-dealer. Here's another. [Giving him another coin]
Three rolls of the dice is lucky, sir, and the old saying goes "the third time's the charm." Triple-time is a good beat for dancing, and the bells of Saint Bennet's church chime—one, two, three.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You won't win any more money from me with this third roll of the dice. But if you'll tell your lady that I'm here to speak with her, and bring her along with you when you return, then you might wake up my generosity.
Well then, sir, I'll sing a lullaby to your generosity while I'm gone, so it can nap until I return. I'll go now, sir, but don't think that I'm doing this just because I'm greedy—I'm more interested in the art of begging than the actual money. But as you say, sir, let your generosity sleep, and I'll wake it up soon.
Here comes the man who rescued me, sir.
I remember that face well, though the last time I saw it it was blackened by the smoke of war. He was the captain of a small, flimsy ship, worthless because of its size—but with that pitiful boat he fought such a damaging battle against my fleet's most noble warship that we had to admire him even in our bitter defeat.[To the officer] What's going on here?
Orsino, this is the same Antonio who took our ship the Phoenix and its cargo from Crete, and who boarded the Tiger in the battle where your young nephew Titus lost his leg. We arrested him here in the streets, where he was recklessly brawling as if he didn't care that we were looking for him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He was kind to me, sir, and drew his sword to defend me, but then he said some strange things to me. I don't know what he meant, except that he might be insane.
You famous pirate! You thief of the seas, what foolish boldness inspired you to visit the enemies you once robbed and murdered?
Orsino, noble sir, I must deny those names you give me. I have never been a thief or a pirate, though I admit to being your enemy for good and solid reasons. I am here because I've been bewitched. I rescued that ungrateful boy—the one there by your side—from the rude sea's angry waves. He was a wreck, and seemed past hope. I saved his life and gave him my love, without reservation or restraint, and dedicated myself to him totally. For his sake I endangered myself in this town, and purely out of love for him I drew my sword to defend him when he was being attacked. But when I was arrested, he decided not to endanger himself, and he used his treacherous cunning to pretend that he'd never met me before. In the blink of an eye he became a totally different person, and he refused to give me back my own purse, which I had lent to him just half an hour before.
How is this possible?
[To ANTONIO] When did he come to this town?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Today, my lord. For three months before that we spent every day and night together without a break.
Look, an angel is walking on earth—here comes the Countess. But as for you, fellow, your words are madness: this youth has worked for me for three months. But more of that later. [To an officer] Take him away.
What do you want, my lord—except for the one thing you cannot have—that I can help you with? Cesario, you broke your promise to me.
Madam?
Gracious Olivia—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What do you have to say for yourself, Cesario?—My lord, a moment—
My lord wants to speak. It's my duty to be silent.
If you're just going to repeat the same old things, my lord, then it will be as pleasant to my ears as hearing howling after listening to beautiful music.
Are you still so cruel?
I am still consistent, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Consistent in what, being horrible? I have breathed from my soul the most faithful, devoted offerings possible, but they've only fallen upon your ungrateful and unwelcoming altar, you rude lady. What else can I do?
Do whatever pleases you, within reason.
Why shouldn't I—if I had the heart to do it—kill what I love, like that Egyptian thief Thyamis who murdered the woman he loved just before he died? That kind of savage jealousy sometimes seems noble. But listen to me now: since you keep denying my faithful love, and since I can guess who has forced me from my rightful place in your heart, you can go on being a cold-hearted tyrant as long as you like—but I'm going to take your darling Cesario from you. I know that you love him, and I swear that I care deeply for him as well, but I must tear him away from you because his place in your heart humiliates me.[To VIOLA] Come, boy, come with me. My thoughts grow dark and mischievous. I'll sacrifice this boy I care for just to spite the fair lady with the black heart.
And I would cheerfully, readily, and willingly die a thousand deaths if it would bring you peace.
Where is Cesario going?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'm following the man I love more than I love my eyes or my life, more, far more, than I'll ever love a wife. If I'm lying about this, you angels above, put me to death for dishonoring my love.
Oh no, you scorn me! I've been tricked!
Who tricked you? Who has done you wrong?
Have you forgotten your own actions? Has it been so long?—Call the priest who was with us earlier.
[To VIOLA] Come, let's go!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where are you taking him, my lord?—Cesario, my husband, stay.
Husband?
Yes, husband. Can he deny it?
Are you her husband, you wretch?
No, my lord, I'm not.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, your fear is so great that it makes you disguise your true identity. But don't be afraid, Cesario. Reach out and accept your good fortune. Be the person you know you are, and then you will be as powerful as the person you fear.
Oh, welcome, father! Father, can I respectfully ask you to explain (though we recently wanted to hide it, the time is now ripe to reveal it) what you know has happened between this youth and me?
You made an oath of eternal love, which was confirmed by joining hands, proved by a holy kiss, and strengthened by an exchange of rings. I witnessed and approved all this in my official capacity as a priest. All this took place only two hours ago.
[To VIOLA] Oh, you lying little puppy! How much worse will you be when you're old and gray? Or will you get so good at being crafty that your own tricks will trick you? Farewell, and take her; but go somewhere where you and I will never meet again.
My lord, I promise—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, don't promise! Keep a little faith—your faith in me—even though you're so afraid.
For the love of God, someone get a doctor! Send one to Sir Toby right away.
What's the matter?
He's cut my head open and given Sir Toby a bloody head too. For the love of God, help! I'd pay forty pounds to be at home right now.
Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That Cesario, the Duke's gentleman. We thought he was a coward, but he actually fights like the devil himself.
My servant Cesario?
By God, here he is!—You broke my head for no reason. I didn't do anything, and whatever I did, Sir Toby made me do.
Why are you saying this to me? I never hurt you. You drew your sword against me without a good reason, but I spoke politely to you and didn't hurt you.
If a bloody head is an injury, then you've hurt me. I don't think you care at all about a bloody head.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here comes Sir Toby, limping. He'll tell you more about what happened. If he hadn't been drunk, he would have hurt you more than he did.
Hello, gentleman! How are you?
It doesn't matter: he has hurt me, and that's all there is to it. [To the FOOL] You drunken fool, have you seen Dick the surgeon?
Oh, he's drunk, Sir Toby, since an hour ago. He was cross eyed at eight in the morning.
Then he's a rogue, and I hate a drunken rogue. He spins and sways like he's doing a slow dance.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Take him away! Who has caused all this trouble?
I'll help you, Sir Toby. They'll bandage us up together.
Will you help me—an ass, and a fool, and a bastard, a gullible skinny bastard?
Get him to bed, and make sure his wounds are tended to.
I am sorry, madam. I've hurt your relative, but I would've had to do the same thing even to my own brother, for I was acting in self-defense. You're looking at me like I'm a stranger, so I can tell that I've offended you. Forgive me, sweet one, for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* One face, one voice, one manner of dressing, but two people! An optical illusion—it both is and is not!
Antonio, oh my dear Antonio! How time has tortured me ever since I lost you!
Are you Sebastian, then?
Do you doubt that, Antonio?
How have you divided yourself in two? These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple. Which is Sebastian?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It's unbelievable!
[Looking at VIOLA] Is that me standing there? I never had a brother, and I'm not a god who can be everywhere at once. I had a sister, but she was drowned by the cruel ocean. Please tell me, are you related to me? What country are you from? What is your name? Who are your parents?
I am from Messaline. Sebastian was my father, and my brother was also named Sebastian. He was dressed just like you when he drowned. If ghosts can take on human forms and clothes, then you must be here to frighten us.
I am a spirit indeed, as I have a soul. But my spirit wears the same earthly form that I've had since I was born. If you were only a woman—since everything else about you fits—I would cry and hug you, and say "Welcome, welcome drowned Viola!"
My father had a mole on his forehead.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Mine did too.
And he died on the day that Viola turned thirteen.
Oh, that memory is still so vivid to me! He did indeed die on the day my sister turned thirteen.
If the only thing keeping us from being happy is my deceptive masculine clothes, then don't hug me until every circumstance of place, time, and luck fit together and prove that I am Viola. To confirm this, I'll take you to a captain in this town who has been keeping my woman's clothing, and who saved my life so that I might serve this noble Duke. Everything that's happened to me since then has involved this lady and this lord.
[To OLIVIA] So you've been mistaken, my lady. But nature has fixed everything and drawn you to your natural orientation. Your love for Cesario was really an inclination for someone like me. You wanted to be married to a maiden, but you weren't actually deceived about that, given that you believed you were married to my sister.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To OLIVIA] Don't be shocked. His blood is pure and noble. If all this is true, as the two really seem to be brother and sister, then I too will share in the spoils of this lucky shipwreck. [To VIOLA] Boy, you've said to me a thousand times that you'd never love a woman like you love me.
Everything I said before I'll promise once again, and I'll keep my promises in my soul like fire is kept in the sun.
Give me your hand, and let me see you in your woman's clothes.
The captain who first brought me to shore has my woman's clothing. He has some legal charge against him, and is in prison because he's been sued by Malvolio—a gentleman and a servant of my lady's.
He'll release him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Bring Malvolio here—but no, now I remember, they say that the poor gentleman is mentally confused. My own distracting madness made me forget all about him. [To the FOOL] How is he, fool?
Truly, madam, he keeps the devil away as well as a man in his situation can. He's written a letter to you here. I should have given it to you this morning, but a madman's letters aren't gospel truth, so it doesn't matter too much when they're delivered.
Open it, and read it.
Be prepared to learn a lot now, for a fool is reciting the words of a madman. [Reading] "By God, madam,"—
What's this? Are you crazy?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, madam, but I'm reading the words of craziness. And if you want things done the right way, then let me do a dramatic reading.
Please, read it like a sane person.
I will, holy lady, but even if I read this letter sanely, I'll still sound crazy. So pay attention, my princess, and listen.
[Giving the letter to FABIAN] You read it, sir.
[Reading]"By God, madam, you've wronged me, and the world will know about it. You've put me in a dark room and let your drunken uncle torment me, but I've still kept my sanity and am no more crazy than you are. I have your own letter, which encouraged me to act the way I did, and with this letter I will prove that I am innocent and you are guilty. Think of me however you want. I will leave my role as your steward and speak out about the injuries you've caused me. Signed, the madly-abused Malvolio."
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Did he write this?
Yes, madam.
This doesn't sound much like madness.
Release him, Fabian, and bring him here.
My lord, if you'll take into consideration what you've just seen and heard, I hope that you'll accept me as a sister-in-law instead of a wife. We can have the two weddings on the same day, if you want, here at my house, and I'll pay for everything.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, I'll happily accept your offer. [To VIOLA] Your master releases you from his service. Because you served me so well, doing things that no woman, especially one of your noble birth, should be expected to do, and because you called me "master" for so long, I will offer you my hand in marriage. From now on you'll be your master's mistress.
[To VIOLA] And you will be my sister!
Is this the madman?
Yes, my lord, that's him. How are you, Malvolio?
Madam, you have mistreated me. Scandalously mistreated me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have I, Malvolio? No.
[Handing OLIVIA a paper] Lady, you have. Please look at that letter. You can't deny that it's in your handwriting. Try to write differently if you can, or try to say that that isn't your seal, with your design on it—you can't deny any of this. Well, admit it then and tell me, with the sincerity of an honorable person, why you gave me such clear signs of affection, telling me to come to you smiling, with crossed laces, to wear yellow stockings, and to be rude to Sir Toby and the servants? And when I obeyed all your commands, why did you then let me be imprisoned in a dark house, be visited by a priest—and make me into the biggest fool and sucker that ever had a joke played on him? Tell me why.
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my handwriting. Though, I admit, the letters look very similar. But it's definitely Maria's handwriting. And now that I think about it, she was the one who first told me you were crazy, and then you came in smiling and acting in the way the letter instructed you to act. Please, don't be so upset. You've been fooled by a cruel practical joke, but when we find out who's responsible for this, you will be the judge and jury who sentences the culprits to a punishment for their crime.
Good madam, let me speak, and don't let any quarreling cast a shadow over the surprised joy of these happy couples, which I have been amazed by. To avoid any fighting, I'll confess that Toby and I were the ones who tricked Malvolio here, because of the arrogant and rude behavior we had observed in him. Maria only wrote the letter at Sir Toby's urgent request, and he has rewarded her for it by marrying her. The whole practical joke should inspire laughter instead of revenge, especially if we consider that both sides injured each other equally.
[To MALVOLIO] Alas, you poor fool, how they've humiliated you!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, "some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them." I was a member of this farce as well, pretending to be a priest named Sir Topas, but what does that matter? [Imitating MALVOLIO] "By God, fool, I am not mad."—But do you remember what else he said? "Madam, why do you laugh at such an empty-headed villain? If you don't laugh at him, he can't think of anything to say." And so—what goes around comes around.
I'll get my revenge on the whole pack of you.
He really has been badly treated.
Follow him and try to calm him down some.
He hasn't told us about that captain yet. When that's taken care of and the time is convenient, we will be married. Until then, sweet sister-in-law, we won't leave this place. Cesario, come here. You'll be Cesario to me while you're still a man, but when I see you in women's clothes, then you'll be Orsino's mistress, and his love's queen.
