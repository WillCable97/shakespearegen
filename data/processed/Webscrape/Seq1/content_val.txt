* I could render one.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremasterand a knave; which not-withstanding, thou shalt beno less esteemed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is a whoremaster, fool?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. 'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord; sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher, with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is very often like a knight; and, generally, in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen, this spirit walks in.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou art not altogether a fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery asI have, so much wit thou lackest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That answer might have become Apemantus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come with me, fool, come.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do not always follow lover, elder brother andwoman; sometime the philosopher.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time Had you not fully laid my state before me, That I might so have rated my expense, As I had leave of means?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You would not hear me,At many leisures I proposed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go to: Perchance some single vantages you took. When my indispos ition put you back: And that unaptness made your minister, Thus to excuse yourself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O my good lord, At many times I brought in my accounts, Laid them before you; you would throw them off, And say, you found them in mine honesty. When, for some trifling present, you have bid me Return so much, I have shook my head and wept; Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you To hold your hand more close: I did endure Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have Prompted you in the ebb of your estate And your great flow of debts. My loved lord, Though you hear now, too late—yet now's a time— The greatest of your having lacks a half To pay your present debts.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let all my land be sold.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone; And what remains will hardly stop the mouth Of present dues: the future comes apace: What shall defend the interim? and at length How goes our reckoning?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To Lacedaemon did my land extend.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O my good lord, the world is but a word:Were it all yours to give it in a breath,How quickly were it gone!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You tell me true.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood, Call me before the exactest auditors And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me, When all our offices have been oppress'd With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept With drunken spilth of wine, when every room Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy, I have retired me to a wasteful cock, And set mine eyes at flow.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Prithee, no more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord! How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants This night englutted! Who is not Timon's? What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon's? Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon! Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise, The breath is gone whereof this praise is made: Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers, These flies are couch'd.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, sermon me no further: No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart; Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given. Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack, To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart; If I would broach the vessels of my love, And try the argument of hearts by borrowing, Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use As I can bid thee speak.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Assurance bless your thoughts!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd, That I account them blessings; for by these Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends. Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord? my lord?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will dispatch you severally; you to Lord Lucius; to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour to-day: you, to Sempronius: commend me to their loves, and, I am proud, say, that my occasions have found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let the request be fifty talents.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As you have said, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go you, sir, to the senators— Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have Deserved this hearing —bid 'em send o' the instant A thousand talents to me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have been bold— For that I knew it the most general way— To them to use your signet and your name; But they do shake their heads, and I am here No richer in return.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is't true? can't be?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They answer, in a joint and corporate voice, That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot Do what they would; are sorry—you are honourable,— But yet they could have wish'd—they know not— Something hath been amiss —a noble nature May catch a wrench—would all were well—'tis pity;— And so, intending other serious matters, After distasteful looks and these hard fractions, With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods They froze me into silence.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You gods, reward them! Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows Have their ingratitude in them hereditary: Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows; 'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind; And nature, as it grows again toward earth, Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go to Ventidius.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Prithee, be not sad,Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak.No blame belongs to thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ventidius lately Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd Into a great estate: when he was poor, Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends, I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me; Bid him suppose some good necessity Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd With those five talents.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That had, give't these fellowsTo whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would I could not think it: that thought isbounty's foe;Being free itself, it thinks all others so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I thank you, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here's my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] One of Lord Timon's men? a gift, I warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome, sir. Fill me some wine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And how does that honourable, complete, free-heartedgentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lordand master?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* His health is well sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am right glad that his health is well, sir: andwhat hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir; which, in my lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to supply; who, having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to furnish him, nothing doubting your present assistance therein.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas, good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha' dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less, and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get him from't.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Please your lordship, here is the wine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your lordship speaks your pleasure.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit—give thee thy due—and one that knows what belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if the time use thee well: good parts in thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Get you gone, sirrah.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou knowest well enough, although thou comest to me, that this is no time to lend money, especially upon bare friendship, without security. Here's three solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is't possible the world should so much differ,And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,To him that worships thee!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* May these add to the number that may scald thee! Let moulten coin be thy damnation, Thou disease of a friend, and not himself! Has friendship such a faint and milky heart, It turns in less than two nights? O you gods, I feel master's passion! this slave, Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him: Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment, When he is turn'd to poison? O, may diseases only work upon't! And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature Which my lord paid for, be of any power To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, andan honourable gentleman.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago, one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I tell you, denied, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What a strange case was that! now, before the gods, I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man! there was very little honour showed in't. For my own part, I must needs confess, I have received some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his; yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* See, by good hap, yonder's my lord;I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my veryexquisite friend.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* May it please your honour, my lord hath sent—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared tothat lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thankhim, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;requesting your lordship to supply his instant usewith so many talents.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know his lordship is but merry with me;He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.If his occasion were not virtuous,I should not urge it half so faithfully.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time, when I might ha' shown myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I should purchase the day before for a little part, and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now, before the gods, I am not able to do,—the more beast, I say:—I was sending to use Lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power to be kind: and tell him this from me, I count it one of my greatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, sir, I shall.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;And he that's once denied will hardly speed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do you observe this, Hostilius?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, too well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the same piece Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father, And kept his credit with his purse, Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks, But Timon's silver treads upon his lip; And yet—O, see the monstrousness of man When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!— He does deny him, in respect of his, What charitable men afford to beggars.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Religion groans at it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* For mine own part, I never tasted Timon in my life, Nor came any of his bounties over me, To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest, For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue And honourable carriage, Had his necessity made use of me, I would have put my wealth into donation, And the best half should have return'd to him, So much I love his heart: but, I perceive, Men must learn now with pity to dispense; For policy sits above conscience.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Must he needs trouble me in 't,—hum!—'bove all others? He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus; And now Ventidius is wealthy too, Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these Owe their estates unto him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord,They have all been touch'd and found base metal, forThey have all denied him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How! have they denied him? Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him? And does he send to me? Three? hum! It shows but little love or judgment in him: Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like physicians, Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me? Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him, That might have known my place: I see no sense for't, But his occasion might have woo'd me first; For, in my conscience, I was the first man That e'er received gift from him: And does he think so backwardly of me now, That I'll requite its last? No: So it may prove an argument of laughter To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool. I'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum, Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake; I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return, And with their faint reply this answer join; Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot think but, in the end, the villainies of man will set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked, like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his politic love. This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled, Save only the gods: now his friends are dead, Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards Many a bounteous year must be employ'd Now to guard sure their master. And this is all a liberal course allows; Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The like to you kind Varro.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lucius!What, do we meet together?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, and I thinkOne business does command us all; for mine Is money.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So is theirs and ours.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lucius' Servant And Sir Philotus too!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good day at once.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Welcome, good brother.What do you think the hour?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Labouring for nine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So much?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is not my lord seen yet?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not yet.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him: You must consider that a prodigal course Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable. I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse; That is one may reach deep enough, and yet Find little.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am of your fear for that.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll show you how to observe a strange event.Your lord sends now for money.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most true, he does.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,For which I wait for money.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is against my heart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Mark, how strange it shows, Timon in this should pay more than he owes: And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels, And send for money for 'em.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Five thousand mine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,Your master's confidence was above mine;Else, surely, his had equall'd.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* One of Lord Timon's men.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready tocome forth?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, indeed, he is not.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do you hear, sir?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By your leave, sir,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What do ye ask of me, my friend?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We wait for certain money here, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, If money were as certain as your waiting, 'Twere sure enough. Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills, When your false masters eat of my lord's meat? Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts And take down the interest into their gluttonous maws. You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up; Let me pass quietly: Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end; I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, but this answer will not serve.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;For you serve knaves.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in? such may rail against great buildings.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some other hour, I should derive much from't; for, take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him; he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Many do keep their chambers are not sick: And, if it be so far beyond his health, Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts, And make a clear way to the gods.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good gods!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We cannot take this for answer, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Within] Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, are my doors opposed against my passage? Have I been ever free, and must my house Be my retentive enemy, my gaol? The place which I have feasted, does it now, Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Put in now, Titus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, here is my bill.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here's mine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And mine, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And ours, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* All our bills.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, my lord,-
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cut my heart in sums.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Mine, fifty talents.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tell out my blood.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Five thousand drops pays that.What yours?—and yours?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their capsat their money: these debts may well be calleddesperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.Creditors? devils!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My dear lord,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What if it should be so?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll have it so. My steward!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again, Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius: All, sirrah, all: I'll once more feast the rascals.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O my lord, You only speak from your distracted soul; There is not so much left, to furnish out A moderate table.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be't not in thy care; go,I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tideOf knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault'sBloody; 'tis necessary he should die:Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most true; the law shall bruise him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, captain?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am an humble suitor to your virtues; For pity is the virtue of the law, And none but tyrants use it cruelly. It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood, Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't. He is a man, setting his fate aside, Of comely virtues: Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice— An honour in him which buys out his fault— But with a noble fury and fair spirit, Seeing his reputation touch'd to death, He did oppose his foe: And with such sober and unnoted passion He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent, As if he had but proved an argument.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You undergo too strict a paradox, Striving to make an ugly deed look fair: Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling Upon the head of valour; which indeed Is valour misbegot and came into the world When sects and factions were newly born: He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs His outsides, to wear them like his raiment, carelessly, And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart, To bring it into danger. If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill, What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You cannot make gross sins look clear:To revenge is no valour, but to bear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lords, then, under favour, pardon me, If I speak like a captain. Why do fond men expose themselves to battle, And not endure all threats? sleep upon't, And let the foes quietly cut their throats, Without repugnancy? If there be Such valour in the bearing, what make we Abroad? why then, women are more valiant That stay at home, if bearing carry it, And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon Loaden with irons wiser than the judge, If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords, As you are great, be pitifully good: Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood? To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust; But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just. To be in anger is impiety; But who is man that is not angry? Weigh but the crime with this.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You breathe in vain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In vain! his service doneAt Lacedaemon and ByzantiumWere a sufficient briber for his life.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What's that?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I say, my lords, he has done fair service, And slain in fight many of your enemies: How full of valour did he bear himself In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He has made too much plenty with 'em; He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner: If there were no foes, that were enough To overcome him: in that beastly fury He has been known to commit outrages, And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us, His days are foul and his drink dangerous.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He dies.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hard fate! he might have died in war. My lords, if not for any parts in him— Though his right arm might purchase his own time And be in debt to none —yet, more to move you, Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both: And, for I know your reverend ages love Security, I'll pawn my victories, all My honours to you, upon his good returns. If by this crime he owes the law his life, Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore For law is strict, and war is nothing more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,He forfeits his own blood that spills another.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,I do beseech you, know me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Call me to your remembrances.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I cannot think but your age has forgot me; It could not else be, I should prove so base, To sue, and be denied such common grace: My wounds ache at you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do you dare our anger?'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;We banish thee for ever.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Banish me!Banish your dotage; banish usury,That makes the senate ugly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee, Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell our spirit, He shall be executed presently.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live Only in bone, that none may look on you! I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes, While they have told their money and let out Their coin upon large interest, I myself Rich only in large hurts. All those for this? Is this the balsam that the usuring senate Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment! It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd; It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury, That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up My discontented troops, and lay for hearts. 'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds; Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The good time of day to you, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lorddid but try us this other day.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when weencountered: I hope it is not so low with him ashe made it seem in the trial of his several friends.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and I must needs appear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my provision was out.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how allthings go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed ofyou?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A thousand pieces.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A thousand pieces!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What of you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He sent to me, sir,—Here he comes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The swallow follows not summer more willing than weyour lordship.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] Nor more willingly leaves winter; such summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordshipthat I returned you an empty messenger.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, sir, let it not trouble you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My noble lord,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ah, my good friend, what cheer?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,I was so unfortunate a beggar.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Think not on 't, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you had sent but two hours before,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let it not cumber your better remembrance.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, bring in all together.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* All covered dishes!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Royal cheer, I warrant you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Doubt not that, if money and the season can yieldit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How do you? What's the news?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alcibiades banished!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis so, be sure of it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How! how!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I pray you, upon what?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My worthy friends, will you draw near?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is the old man still.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will 't hold? will 't hold?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It does: but time will—and so—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do conceive.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place: sit, sit. The gods require our thanks. You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves praised: but reserve still to give, lest your deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that one need not lend to another; for, were your godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at the table, let a dozen of them be—as they are. The rest of your fees, O gods—the senators of Athens, together with the common lag of people—what is amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for destruction. For these my present friends, as they are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to nothing are they welcome. Uncover, dogs, and lap.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What does his lordship mean?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know not.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* May you a better feast never behold, You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water Is your perfection. This is Timon's last; Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries, Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces Your reeking villany.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Live loathed and long, Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites, Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears, You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies, Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks! Of man and beast the infinite malady Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go? Soft! take thy physic first—thou too—and thou;— Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast, Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest. Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be Of Timon man and all humanity!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, my lords!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Push! did you see my cap?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have lost my gown.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he hasbeat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Did you see my cap?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here 'tis.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here lies my gown.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let's make no stay.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lord Timon's mad.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I feel 't upon my bones.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall, That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth, And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent! Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools, Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench, And minister in their steads! to general filths Convert o' the instant, green virginity, Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast; Rather than render back, out with your knives, And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal! Large-handed robbers your grave masters are, And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed; Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen, pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire, With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear, Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth, Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood, Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades, Degrees, observances, customs, and laws, Decline to your confounding contraries, And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men, Your potent and infectious fevers heap On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica, Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth, That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive, And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains, Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath, at their society, as their friendship, may merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee, But nakedness, thou detestable town! Take thou that too, with multiplying bans! Timon will to the woods; where he shall find The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind. The gods confound—hear me, you good gods all— The Athenians both within and out that wall! And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hear you, master steward, where's our master?Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,I am as poor as you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Such a house broke! So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not One friend to take his fortune by the arm, And go along with him!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As we do turn our backs From our companion thrown into his grave, So his familiars to his buried fortunes Slink all away, leave their false vows with him, Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self, A dedicated beggar to the air, With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty, Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery; That see I by our faces; we are fellows still, Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark, And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck, Hearing the surges threat: we must all part Into this sea of air.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good fellows all, The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you. Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake, Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say, As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes, 'We have seen better days.' Let each take some; Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more: Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us! Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt, Since riches point to misery and contempt? Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live But in a dream of friendship? To have his pomp and all what state compounds But only painted, like his varnish'd friends? Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart, Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood, When man's worst sin is, he does too much good! Who, then, dares to be half so kind again? For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men. My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed, Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord! He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to Supply his life, or that which can command it. I'll follow and inquire him out: I'll ever serve his mind with my best will; Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb, Whose procreation, residence, and birth, Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes; The greater scorns the lesser: not nature, To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune, But by contempt of nature. Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord; The senator shall bear contempt hereditary, The beggar native honour. It is the pasture lards the rother's sides, The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares, In purity of manhood stand upright, And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be, So are they all; for every grise of fortune Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique; There's nothing level in our cursed natures, But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd All feasts, societies, and throngs of men! His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains: Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate With thy most operant poison! What is here? Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods, I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens! Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair, Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant. Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this Will lug your priests and servants from your sides, Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads: This yellow slave Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed, Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves And give them title, knee and approbation With senators on the bench: this is it That makes the wappen'd widow wed again; She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices To the April day again. Come, damned earth, Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds Among the route of nations, I will make thee Do thy right nature.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha! a drum ? Thou'rt quick, But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief, When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand. Nay, stay thou out for earnest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What art thou there? speak.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,For showing me again the eyes of man!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,That art thyself a man?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,That I might love thee something.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know thee well;But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know thee too; and more than that I know thee, I not desire to know. Follow thy drum; With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules: Religious canons, civil laws are cruel; Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine Hath in her more destruction than thy sword, For all her cherubim look.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy lips rot off!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will not kiss thee; then the rot returnsTo thine own lips again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How came the noble Timon to this change?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As the moon does, by wanting light to give:But then renew I could not, like the moon;There were no suns to borrow of.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Noble Timon,What friendship may I do thee?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* None, but toMaintain my opinion.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is it, Timon?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for thou art a man!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I see them now; then was a blessed time.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is this the Athenian minion, whom the worldVoiced so regardfully?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Art thou Timandra?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee; Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust. Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth To the tub-fast and the diet.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hang thee, monster!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits Are drown'd and lost in his calamities. I have but little gold of late, brave Timon, The want whereof doth daily make revolt In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved, How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth, Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states, But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?I had rather be alone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, fare thee well:Here is some gold for thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Keep it, I cannot eat it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, Timon, and have cause.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The gods confound them all in thy conquest;And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why me, Timon?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That, by killing of villains, Thou wast born to conquer my country. Put up thy gold: go on,—here's gold,—go on; Be as a planetary plague, when Jove Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one: Pity not honour'd age for his white beard; He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron; It is her habit only that is honest, Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps, That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes, Are not within the leaf of pity writ, But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe, Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy; Think it a bastard, whom the oracle Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut, And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects; Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes; Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes, Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding, Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers: Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent, Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thougivest me,Not all thy counsel.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curseupon thee!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Enough to make a whore forswear her trade, And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts, Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable, Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues The immortal gods that hear you, —spare your oaths, I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still; And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you, Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up; Let your close fire predominate his smoke, And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months, Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs With burthens of the dead;—some that were hang'd, No matter:—wear them, betray with them: whore still; Paint till a horse may mire upon your face, A pox of wrinkles!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, more gold: what then?Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Consumptions sow In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins, And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice, That he may never more false title plead, Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen, That scolds against the quality of flesh, And not believes himself: down with the nose, Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away Of him that, his particular to foresee, Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate ruffians bald; And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war Derive some pain from you: plague all; That your activity may defeat and quell The source of all erection. There's more gold: Do you damn others, and let this damn you, And ditches grave you all!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I never did thee harm.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, thou spokest well of me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Call'st thou that harm?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Men daily find it. Get thee away, and takeThy beagles with thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We but offend him. Strike!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast, Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle, Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd, Engenders the black toad and adder blue, The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm, With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine; Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate, From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root! Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb, Let it no more bring out ingrateful man! Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears; Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face Hath to the marbled mansion all above Never presented! —O, a root,—dear thanks!— Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas; Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind, That from it all consideration slips!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* More man? plague, plague!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I was directed hither: men reportThou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is in thee a nature but infected; A poor unmanly melancholy sprung From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place? This slave-like habit? and these looks of care? Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft; Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods, By putting on the cunning of a carper. Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee, And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe, Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain, And call it excellent: thou wast told thus; Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again, Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself; A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain, Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees, That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels, And skip where thou point'st out? will the cold brook, Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste, To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures Whose naked natures live in an the spite Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks, To the conflicting elements exposed, Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee; O, thou shalt find—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A fool of thee: depart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I love thee better now than e'er I did.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I hate thee worse.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou flatter'st misery.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why dost thou seek me out?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To vex thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Always a villain's office or a fool's.Dost please thyself in't?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What! a knave too?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again, Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before: The one is filling still, never complete; The other, at high wish: best state, contentless, Hath a distracted and most wretched being, Worse than the worst, content. Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not by his breath that is more miserable. Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog. Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded The sweet degrees that this brief world affords To such as may the passive drugs of it Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself In general riot; melted down thy youth In different beds of lust; and never learn'd The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd The sugar'd game before thee. But myself, Who had the world as my confectionary, The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men At duty, more than I could frame employment, That numberless upon me stuck as leaves Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare For every storm that blows: I, to bear this, That never knew but better, is some burden: Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men? They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given? If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag, Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff To some she beggar and compounded thee Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone! If thou hadst not been born the worst of men, Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Art thou proud yet?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, that I am not thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I, that I wasNo prodigal.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I, that I am one now: Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee, I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone. That the whole life of Athens were in this! Thus would I eat it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here; I will mend thy feast.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* First mend my company, take away thyself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;if not, I would it were.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What wouldst thou have to Athens?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here is no use for gold.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The best and truest;For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where liest o' nights, Timon?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Under that's above me.Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eatit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where wouldst thou send it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To sauce thy dishes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for thee, eat it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* On what I hate I feed not.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dost hate a medlar?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, though it look like thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldsthave loved thyself better now. What man didst thouever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thouever know beloved?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Myself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep adog.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What things in the world canst thou nearest compareto thy flatterers?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Women nearest; but men, men are the thingsthemselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion ofmen, and remain a beast with the beasts?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, Timon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t' attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse: wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art thou already, that seest not thy loss in transformation!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thoumightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth ofAthens is become a forest of beasts.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll see thee again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt bewelcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I name thee.I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would my tongue could rot them off!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!Choler does kill me that thou art alive;I swound to see thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would thou wouldst burst!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Away,Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall loseA stone by thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Beast!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Slave!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Toad!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Rogue, rogue, rogue! I am sick of this false world, and will love nought But even the mere necessities upon 't. Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave; Lie where the light foam the sea may beat Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph, That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce 'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars! Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer, Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god, That solder'st close impossibilities, And makest them kiss! that speak'st with every tongue, To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts! Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue Set them into confounding odds, that beasts May have the world in empire!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would 'twere so!But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Throng'd to!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy back, I prithee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Live, and love thy misery.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Long live so, and so die.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am quit.Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where should he have this gold? It is some poor fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his friends, drove him into this melancholy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let us make the assay upon him: if he care notfor't, he will supply us easily; if he covetouslyreserve it, how shall's get it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is not this he?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis his description.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He; I know him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Save thee, Timon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, thieves?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Soldiers, not thieves.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Both too; and women's sons.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We are not thieves, but men that much do want.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your greatest want is, you want much of meat. Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots; Within this mile break forth a hundred springs; The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips; The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,As beasts and birds and fishes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes; You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft In limited professions. Rascal thieves, Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape, Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth, And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician; His antidotes are poison, and he slays Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together; Do villany, do, since you protest to do't, Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery. The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief, And her pale fire she snatches from the sun: The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief, That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen From general excrement : each thing's a thief: The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away, Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats: All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go, Break open shops; nothing can you steal, But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Has almost charmed me from my profession, bypersuading me to it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advisesus; not to have us thrive in our mystery.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no timeso miserable but a man may be true.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O you gods! Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord? Full of decay and failing? O monument And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd! What an alteration of honour Has desperate want made! What viler thing upon the earth than friends Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends! How rarely does it meet with this time's guise, When man was wish'd to love his enemies! Grant I may ever love, and rather woo Those that would mischief me than those that do! Has caught me in his eye: I will present My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord, Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Away! what art thou?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have you forgot me, sir?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An honest poor servant of yours.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then I know thee not:I never had honest man about me, I; allI kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The gods are witness,Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer griefFor his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I love thee, Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping: Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I beg of you to know me, good my lord,To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lastsTo entertain me as your steward still.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Had I a steward So true, so just, and now so comfortable? It almost turns my dangerous nature mild. Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man Was born of woman. Forgive my general and exceptless rashness, You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim One honest man—mistake me not—but one; No more, I pray,—and he's a steward. How fain would I have hated all mankind! And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee, I fell with curses. Methinks thou art more honest now than wise; For, by oppressing and betraying me, Thou mightst have sooner got another service: For many so arrive at second masters, Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true— For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure— Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous, If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts, Expecting in return twenty for one?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, my most worthy master; in whose breast Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late: You should have fear'd false times when you did feast: Suspect still comes where an estate is least. That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love, Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind, Care of your food and living; and, believe it, My most honour'd lord, For any benefit that points to me, Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange For this one wish, that you had power and wealth To requite me, by making rich yourself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man, Here, take: the gods out of my misery Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy; But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men; Hate all, curse all, show charity to none, But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone, Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em, Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like blasted woods, And may diseases lick up their false bloods! And so farewell and thrive.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, let me stay,And comfort you, my master.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If thou hatest curses,Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As I took note of the place, it cannot be far wherehe abides.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What's to be thought of him? does the rumour holdfor true, that he's so full of gold?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore 'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in us; and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for, if it be a just true report that goes of his having.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What have you now to present unto him?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I willpromise him an excellent piece.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I must serve him so too, tell him of an intentthat's coming toward him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the time: it opens the eyes of expectation: performance is ever the duller for his act; and, but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] Excellent workman! thou canst not paint aman so bad as is thyself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] Must thou needs stand for a villain inthine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults inother men? Do so, I have gold for thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, let's seek him:Then do we sin against our own estate,When we may profit meet, and come too late.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* True;When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] I'll meet you at the turn. What a god's gold, That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple Than where swine feed! 'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam, Settlest admired reverence in a slave: To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey! Fit I meet them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hail, worthy Timon!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Our late noble master!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have I once lived to see two honest men?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, Having often of your open bounty tasted, Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off, Whose thankless natures—O abhorred spirits!— Not all the whips of heaven are large enough: What! to you, Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude With any size of words.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let it go naked, men may see't the better:You that are honest, by being what you are,Make them best seen and known.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He and myselfHave travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,And sweetly felt it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, you are honest men.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We are hither come to offer you our service.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So it is said, my noble lord; but thereforeCame not my friend nor I.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeitBest in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;Thou counterfeit'st most lively.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So, so, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction, Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth That thou art even natural in thine art. But, for all this, my honest-natured friends, I must needs say you have a little fault: Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I You take much pains to mend.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Beseech your honourTo make it known to us.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You'll take it ill.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most thankfully, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you, indeed?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Doubt it not, worthy lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,That mightily deceives you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do we, my lord?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble, Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him, Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured That he's a made-up villain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know none such, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor I.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold, Rid me these villains from your companies: Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught, Confound them by some course, and come to me, I'll give you gold enough.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Name them, my lord, let's know them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You that way and you this, but two in company; Each man apart, all single and alone, Yet an arch-villain keeps him company. If where thou art two villains shall not be, Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside But where one villain is, then him abandon. Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You are an alchemist; make gold of that.Out, rascal dogs!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is in vain that you would speak with Timon; For he is set so only to himself That nothing but himself which looks like man Is friendly with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Bring us to his cave:It is our part and promise to the AtheniansTo speak with Timon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* At all times alike Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand, Offering the fortunes of his former days, The former man may make him. Bring us to him, And chance it as it may.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here is his cave. Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon! Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians, By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee: Speak to them, noble Timon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and be hang'd: For each true word, a blister! and each false Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue, Consuming it with speaking!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Worthy Timon,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I thank them; and would send them back the plague,Could I but catch it for them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, forget What we are sorry for ourselves in thee. The senators with one consent of love Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought On special dignities, which vacant lie For thy best use and wearing.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They confess Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross: Which now the public body, which doth seldom Play the recanter, feeling in itself A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon; And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render, Together with a recompense more fruitful Than their offence can weigh down by the dram; Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs And write in thee the figures of their love, Ever to read them thine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You witch me in it; Surprise me to the very brink of tears: Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes, And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Therefore, so please thee to return with us And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks, Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back Of Alcibiades the approaches wild, Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up His country's peace.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And shakes his threatening swordAgainst the walls of Athens.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Therefore, Timon,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus: If Alcibiades kill my countrymen, Let Alcibiades know this of Timon, That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens, And take our goodly aged men by the beards, Giving our holy virgins to the stain Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war, Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it, In pity of our aged and our youth, I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not, And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not, While you have throats to answer: for myself, There's not a whittle in the unruly camp But I do prize it at my love before The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you To the protection of the prosperous gods, As thieves to keepers.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stay not, all's in vain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, I was writing of my epitaph; it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness Of health and living now begins to mend, And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still; Be Alcibiades your plague, you his, And last so long enough!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We speak in vain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But yet I love my country, and am notOne that rejoices in the common wreck,As common bruit doth put it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That's well spoke.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Commend me to my loving countrymen,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* These words become your lips as they passthorough them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And enter in our ears like great triumphersIn their applauding gates.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Commend me to them, And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs, Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses, Their pangs of love, with other incident throes That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them: I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I like this well; he will return again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have a tree, which grows here in my close, That mine own use invites me to cut down, And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends, Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree From high to low throughout, that whoso please To stop affliction, let him take his haste, Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe, And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come not to me again: but say to Athens, Timon hath made his everlasting mansion Upon the beached verge of the salt flood; Who once a day with his embossed froth The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come, And let my grave-stone be your oracle. Lips, let sour words go by and language end: What is amiss plague and infection mend! Graves only be men's works and death their gain! Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* His discontents are unremoveablyCoupled to nature.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Our hope in him is dead: let us return,And strain what other means is left unto usIn our dear peril.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It requires swift foot.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his filesAs full as thy report?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have spoke the least:Besides, his expedition promisesPresent approach.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I met a courier, one mine ancient friend; Whom, though in general part we were opposed, Yet our old love made a particular force, And made us speak like friends: this man was riding From Alcibiades to Timon's cave, With letters of entreaty, which imported His fellowship i' the cause against your city, In part for his sake moved.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here come our brothers.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect. The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare: Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By all description this should be the place. Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this? Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span: Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man. Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax: Our captain hath in every figure skill, An aged interpreter, though young in days: Before proud Athens he's set down by this, Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sound to this coward and lascivious townOur terrible approach.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time With all licentious measure, making your wills The scope of justice; till now myself and such As slept within the shadow of your power Have wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush, When crouching marrow in the bearer strong Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease, And pursy insolence shall break his wind With fear and horrid flight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Noble and young, When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit, Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear, We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm, To wipe out our ingratitude with loves Above their quantity.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So did we woo Transformed Timon to our city's love By humble message and by promised means: We were not all unkind, nor all deserve The common stroke of war.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* These walls of ours Were not erected by their hands from whom You have received your griefs; nor are they such That these great towers, trophies and schools should fall For private faults in them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor are they living Who were the motives that you first went out; Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord, Into our city with thy banners spread: By decimation, and a tithed death— If thy revenges hunger for that food Which nature loathes—take thou the destined tenth, And by the hazard of the spotted die Let die the spotted.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* All have not offended; For those that were, it is not square to take On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands, Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman, Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage: Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall With those that have offended: like a shepherd, Approach the fold and cull the infected forth, But kill not all together.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What thou wilt,Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smileThan hew to't with thy sword.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Set but thy foot Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope; So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before, To say thou'lt enter friendly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Throw thy glove, Or any token of thine honour else, That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress And not as our confusion, all thy powers Shall make their harbour in our town, till we Have seal'd thy full desire.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then there's my glove; Descend, and open your uncharged ports: Those enemies of Timon's and mine own Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears With my more noble meaning, not a man Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream Of regular justice in your city's bounds, But shall be render'd to your public laws At heaviest answer.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis most nobly spoken.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Descend, and keep your words.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My noble general, Timon is dead; Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea; And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which With wax I brought away, whose soft impression Interprets for my poor ignorance.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Reads the epitaph] 'Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft: Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left! Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate: Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here thy gait.' These well express in thee thy latter spirits: Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs, Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our droplets which From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead Is noble Timon: of whose memory Hereafter more. Bring me into your city, And I will use the olive with my sword, Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each Prescribe to other as each other's leech. Let our drums strike.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Noble patricians, patrons of my right, Defend the justice of my cause with arms, And, countrymen, my loving followers, Plead my successive title with your swords: I am his first-born son, that was the last That wore the imperial diadem of Rome; Then let my father's honours live in me, Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right, If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son, Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome, Keep then this passage to the Capitol And suffer not dishonour to approach The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate, To justice, continence and nobility; But let desert in pure election shine, And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Princes, that strive by factions and by friends Ambitiously for rule and empery, Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand A special party, have, by common voice, In election for the Roman empery, Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius For many good and great deserts to Rome: A nobler man, a braver warrior, Lives not this day within the city walls: He by the senate is accit'd home From weary wars against the barbarous Goths; That, with his sons, a terror to our foes, Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms. Ten years are spent since first he undertook This cause of Rome and chastised with arms Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons In coffins from the field; And now at last, laden with horror's spoils, Returns the good Andronicus to Rome, Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms. Let us entreat, by honour of his name, Whom worthily you would have now succeed. And in the Capitol and senate's right, Whom you pretend to honour and adore, That you withdraw you and abate your strength; Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should, Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally In thy uprightness and integrity, And so I love and honour thee and thine, Thy noble brother Titus and his sons, And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all, Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament, That I will here dismiss my loving friends, And to my fortunes and the people's favor Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Friends, that have been thus forward in my right, I thank you all and here dismiss you all, And to the love and favor of my country Commit myself, my person and the cause.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Rome, be as just and gracious unto meAs I am confident and kind to thee.Open the gates, and let me in.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Romans, make way: the good Andronicus. Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion, Successful in the battles that he fights, With honour and with fortune is return'd From where he circumscribed with his sword, And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds! Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught, Returns with precious jading to the bay From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage, Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs, To re-salute his country with his tears, Tears of true joy for his return to Rome. Thou great defender of this Capitol, Stand gracious to the rites that we intend! Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons, Half of the number that King Priam had, Behold the poor remains, alive and dead! These that survive let Rome reward with love; These that I bring unto their latest home, With burial amongst their ancestors: Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword. Titus, unkind and careless of thine own, Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet, To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx? Make way to lay them by their brethren.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths, That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh, Before this earthy prison of their bones; That so the shadows be not unappeased, Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I give him you, the noblest that survives,The eldest son of this distressed queen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror, Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed, A mother's tears in passion for her son: And if thy sons were ever dear to thee, O, think my son to be as dear to me! Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome, To beautify thy triumphs and return, Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke, But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets, For valiant doings in their country's cause? O, if to fight for king and commonweal Were piety in thine, it is in these. Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood: Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods? Draw near them then in being merciful: Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge: Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me. These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain Religiously they ask a sacrifice: To this your son is mark'd, and die he must, To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Away with him! and make a fire straight;And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O cruel, irreligious piety!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome. Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive To tremble under Titus' threatening looks. Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy With opportunity of sharp revenge Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent, May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths— When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen— To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* See, lord and father, how we have perform'd Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd, And entrails feed the sacrificing fire, Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky. Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren, And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let it be so; and let AndronicusMake this his latest farewell to their souls.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In peace and honour rest you here, my sons; Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest, Secure from worldly chances and mishaps! Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells, Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms, No noise, but silence and eternal sleep: In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In peace and honour live Lord Titus long; My noble lord and father, live in fame! Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears I render, for my brethren's obsequies; And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy, Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome: O, bless me here with thy victorious hand, Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved The cordial of mine age to glad my heart! Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days, And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And welcome, nephews, from successful wars, You that survive, and you that sleep in fame! Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all, That in your country's service drew your swords: But safer triumph is this funeral pomp, That hath aspired to Solon's happiness And triumphs over chance in honour's bed. Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome, Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been, Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust, This palliament of white and spotless hue; And name thee in election for the empire, With these our late-deceased emperor's sons: Be candidatus then, and put it on, And help to set a head on headless Rome.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A better head her glorious body fits Than his that shakes for age and feebleness: What should I don this robe, and trouble you? Be chosen with proclamations to-day, To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life, And set abroad new business for you all? Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years, And led my country's strength successfully, And buried one and twenty valiant sons, Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms, In right and service of their noble country: Give me a staff of honour for mine age, But not a sceptre to control the world: Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Patience, Prince Saturninus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Romans, do me right: Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor. Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell, Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the goodThat noble-minded Titus means to thee!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Content thee, prince; I will restore to theeThe people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Andronicus, I do not flatter thee, But honour thee, and will do till I die: My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends, I will most thankful be; and thanks to men Of noble minds is honourable meed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,I ask your voices and your suffrages:Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To gratify the good Andronicus,And gratulate his safe return to Rome,The people will accept whom he admits.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make, That you create your emperor's eldest son, Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope, Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth, And ripen justice in this commonweal: Then, if you will elect by my advice, Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!'
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* With voices and applause of every sort, Patricians and plebeians, we create Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor, And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done To us in our election this day, I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts, And will with deeds requite thy gentleness: And, for an onset, Titus, to advance Thy name and honourable family, Lavinia will I make my empress, Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart, And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse: Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match I hold me highly honour'd of your grace: And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine, King and commander of our commonweal, The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate My sword, my chariot and my prisoners; Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord: Receive them then, the tribute that I owe, Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life! How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts Rome shall record, and when I do forget The least of these unspeakable deserts, Romans, forget your fealty to me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To TAMORA] Now, madam, are you prisoner to an emperor; To him that, for your honour and your state, Will use you nobly and your followers.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue That I would choose, were I to choose anew. Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance: Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer, Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome: Princely shall be thy usage every way. Rest on my word, and let not discontent Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths. Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not I, my lord; sith true nobilityWarrants these words in princely courtesy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withalTo do myself this reason and this right.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Surprised! by whom?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By him that justly mayBear his betroth'd from all the world away.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Brothers, help to convey her hence away,And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, you pass not here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, villain boy!Barr'st me my way in Rome?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Help, Lucius, help!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so,In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;My sons would never so dishonour me:Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,That is another's lawful promised love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not, Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock: I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once; Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons, Confederates all thus to dishonour me. Was there none else in Rome to make a stale, But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus, Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine, That said'st I begg'd the empire at thy hands.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece To him that flourish'd for her with his sword A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy; One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons, To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* These words are razors to my wounded heart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And therefore, lovely Tamora, queen of Goths, That like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome, If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice, Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride, And will create thee empress of Rome, Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice? And here I swear by all the Roman gods, Sith priest and holy water are so near And tapers burn so bright and every thing In readiness for Hymenaeus stand, I will not re-salute the streets of Rome, Or climb my palace, till from forth this place I lead espoused my bride along with me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear, If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths, She will a handmaid be to his desires, A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany Your noble emperor and his lovely bride, Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine, Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered: There shall we consummate our spousal rites.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am not bid to wait upon this bride.Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine, Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed That hath dishonour'd all our family; Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But let us give him burial, as becomes;Give Mutius burial with our brethren.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb: This monument five hundred years hath stood, Which I have sumptuously re-edified: Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls: Bury him where you can; he comes not here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, this is impiety in you:My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for himHe must be buried with his brethren.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And shall, or him we will accompany.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'And shall!' what villain was it that spakethat word?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He that would vouch it in any place but here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, would you bury him in my despite?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, noble Titus, but entreat of theeTo pardon Mutius and to bury him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest, And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded: My foes I do repute you every one; So, trouble me no more, but get you gone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Father, and in that name doth nature speak,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dear father, soul and substance of us all,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter His noble nephew here in virtue's nest, That died in honour and Lavinia's cause. Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous: The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son Did graciously plead for his funerals: Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy Be barr'd his entrance here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Rise, Marcus, rise. The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw, To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome! Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Kneeling] No man shed tears for noble Mutius;He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,How comes it that the subtle Queen of GothsIs of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know not, Marcus; but I know it is, Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell: Is she not then beholding to the man That brought her for this high good turn so far? Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own, My truth-betrothed love and now my wife? But let the laws of Rome determine all; Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, what I have done, as best I may, Answer I must and shall do with my life. Only thus much I give your grace to know: By all the duties that I owe to Rome, This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here, Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd; That in the rescue of Lavinia With his own hand did slay his youngest son, In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath To be controll'd in that he frankly gave: Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine, That hath express'd himself in all his deeds A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds: 'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me. Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge, How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My worthy lord, if ever Tamora Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine, Then hear me speak in indifferently for all; And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,And basely put it up without revenge?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend I should be author to dishonour you! But on mine honour dare I undertake For good Lord Titus' innocence in all; Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs: Then, at my suit, look graciously on him; Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose, Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart. [Aside to SATURNINUS] My lord, be ruled by me, be won at last; Dissemble all your griefs and discontents: You are but newly planted in your throne; Lest, then, the people, and patricians too, Upon a just survey, take Titus' part, And so supplant you for ingratitude, Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin, Yield at entreats; and then let me alone: I'll find a day to massacre them all And raze their faction and their family, The cruel father and his traitorous sons, To whom I sued for my dear son's life, And make them know what 'tis to let a queen Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain. [Aloud] Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus; Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I thank your majesty, and her, my lord:These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Titus, I am incorporate in Rome, A Roman now adopted happily, And must advise the emperor for his good. This day all quarrels die, Andronicus; And let it be mine honour, good my lord, That I have reconciled your friends and you. For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd My word and promise to the emperor, That you will be more mild and tractable. And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia; By my advice, all humbled on your knees, You shall ask pardon of his majesty.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness,That what we did was mildly as we might,Tendering our sister's honour and our own.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That, on mine honour, here I do protest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here, And at my lovely Tamora's entreats, I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up. Lavinia, though you left me like a churl, I found a friend, and sure as death I swore I would not part a bachelor from the priest. Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides, You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends. This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To-morrow, an it please your majestyTo hunt the panther and the hart with me,With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top, Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft, Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash; Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach. As when the golden sun salutes the morn, And, having gilt the ocean with his beams, Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach, And overlooks the highest-peering hills; So Tamora: Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait, And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown. Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts, To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress, And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus. Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts! I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold, To wait upon this new-made empress. To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen, This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph, This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine, And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's. Holloa! what storm is this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,And manners, to intrude where I am graced;And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all; And so in this, to bear me down with braves. 'Tis not the difference of a year or two Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate: I am as able and as fit as thou To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace; And that my sword upon thee shall approve, And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keepthe peace.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised, Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side, Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends? Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath Till you know better how to handle it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [ Coming forward] Why, how now, lords! So near the emperor's palace dare you draw, And maintain such a quarrel openly? Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge: I would not for a million of gold The cause were known to them it most concerns; Nor would your noble mother for much more Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome. For shame, put up.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not I, till I have sheathed My rapier in his bosom and withal Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* For that I am prepared and full resolved.Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Away, I say! Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore, This petty brabble will undo us all. Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous It is to jet upon a prince's right? What, is Lavinia then become so loose, Or Bassianus so degenerate, That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd Without controlment, justice, or revenge? Young lords, beware! and should the empress know This discord's ground, the music would not please.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I care not, I, knew she and all the world:I love Lavinia more than all the world.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome How furious and impatient they be, And cannot brook competitors in love? I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths By this device.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Aaron, a thousand deathsWould I propose to achieve her whom I love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To achieve her! how?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why makest thou it so strange? She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd; She is a woman, therefore may be won; She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved. What, man! more water glideth by the mill Than wots the miller of; and easy it is Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know: Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother. Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then why should he despair that knows to court it With words, fair looks and liberality? What, hast not thou full often struck a doe, And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or soWould serve your turns.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, so the turn were served.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Aaron, thou hast hit it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would you had hit it too! Then should not we be tired with this ado. Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools To square for this? would it offend you, then That both should speed?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Faith, not me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor me, so I were one.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar: 'Tis policy and stratagem must do That you affect; and so must you resolve, That what you cannot as you would achieve, You must perforce accomplish as you may. Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love. A speedier course than lingering languishment Must we pursue, and I have found the path. My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand; There will the lovely Roman ladies troop: The forest walks are wide and spacious; And many unfrequented plots there are Fitted by kind for rape and villany: Single you thither then this dainty doe, And strike her home by force, if not by words: This way, or not at all, stand you in hope. Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit To villany and vengeance consecrate, Will we acquaint with all that we intend; And she shall file our engines with advice, That will not suffer you to square yourselves, But to your wishes' height advance you both. The emperor's court is like the house of Fame, The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears: The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull; There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns; There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye, And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the streamTo cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.Per Styga, per manes vehor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey, The fields are fragrant and the woods are green: Uncouple here and let us make a bay And wake the emperor and his lovely bride And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal, That all the court may echo with the noise. Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours, To attend the emperor's person carefully: I have been troubled in my sleep this night, But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Many good morrows to your majesty;Madam, to you as many and as good:I promised your grace a hunter's peal.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And you have rung it lustily, my lord;Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lavinia, how say you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I say, no;I have been broad awake two hours and more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have,And to our sport. [To TAMORA] Madam, now shall ye seeOur Roman hunting.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have dogs, my lord,Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,And climb the highest promontory top.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And I have horse will follow where the gameMakes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He that had wit would think that I had none, To bury so much gold under a tree, And never after to inherit it. Let him that thinks of me so abjectly Know that this gold must coin a stratagem, Which, cunningly effected, will beget A very excellent piece of villany: And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That have their alms out of the empress' chest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad, When every thing doth make a gleeful boast? The birds chant melody on every bush, The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun, The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground: Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit, And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds, Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns, As if a double hunt were heard at once, Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise; And, after conflict such as was supposed The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd, When with a happy storm they were surprised And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave, We may, each wreathed in the other's arms, Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber; Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds Be unto us as is a nurse's song Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep .
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, though Venus govern your desires, Saturn is dominator over mine: What signifies my deadly-standing eye, My silence and my cloudy melancholy, My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls Even as an adder when she doth unroll To do some fatal execution? No, madam, these are no venereal signs: Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand, Blood and revenge are hammering in my head. Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul, Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee, This is the day of doom for Bassianus: His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day, Thy sons make pillage of her chastity And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood. Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee, And give the king this fatal plotted scroll. Now question me no more; we are espied; Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty, Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sonsTo back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who have we here? Rome's royal empress, Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop? Or is it Dian, habited like her, Who hath abandoned her holy groves To see the general hunting in this forest?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Saucy controller of our private steps! Had I the power that some say Dian had, Thy temples should be planted presently With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs, Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Under your patience, gentle empress, 'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning; And to be doubted that your Moor and you Are singled forth to try experiments: Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day! 'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian Doth make your honour of his body's hue, Spotted, detested, and abominable. Why are you sequester'd from all your train, Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed. And wander'd hither to an obscure plot, Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor, If foul desire had not conducted you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And, being intercepted in your sport, Great reason that my noble lord be rated For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence, And let her joy her raven-colour'd love; This valley fits the purpose passing well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The king my brother shall have note of this.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:Good king, to be so mightily abused!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why have I patience to endure all this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have I not reason, think you, to look pale? These two have 'ticed me hither to this place: A barren detested vale, you see it is; The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean, O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe: Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds, Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven: And when they show'd me this abhorred pit, They told me, here, at dead time of the night, A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes, Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins, Would make such fearful and confused cries As any mortal body hearing it Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly. No sooner had they told this hellish tale, But straight they told me they would bind me here Unto the body of a dismal yew, And leave me to this miserable death: And then they call'd me foul adulteress, Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms That ever ear did hear to such effect: And, had you not by wondrous fortune come, This vengeance on me had they executed. Revenge it, as you love your mother's life, Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is a witness that I am thy son.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And this for me, struck home to show my strength.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boysYour mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her; First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw: This minion stood upon her chastity, Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty, And with that painted hope braves your mightiness: And shall she carry this unto her grave?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But when ye have the honey ye desire,Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I warrant you, madam, we wil l make that sure.Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoyThat nice-preserved honesty of yours.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will not hear her speak; away with her!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Listen, fair madam: let it be your gloryTo see her tears; but be your heart to themAs unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam? O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee; The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble; Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny. Yet every mother breeds not sons alike: [To CHIRON] Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark: Yet have I heard,—O, could I find it now!— The lion moved with pity did endure To have his princely paws pared all away: Some say that ravens foster forlorn children, The whilst their own birds famish in their nests: O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no, Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know not what it means; away with her!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake, That gave thee life, when well he might have slain thee, Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me, Even for his sake am I pitiless. Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain, To save your brother from the sacrifice; But fierce Andronicus would not relent; Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will, The worse to her, the better loved of me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen, And with thine own hands kill me in this place! For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long; Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more That womanhood denies my tongue to tell: O, keep me from their worse than killing lust, And tumble me into some loathsome pit, Where never man's eye may behold my body: Do this, and be a charitable murderer.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!The blot and enemy to our general name!Confusion fall—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure. Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed, Till all the Andronici be made away. Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor, And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come on, my lords, the better foot before:Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pitWhere I espied the panther fast asleep.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame,Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this, Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers, Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers? A very fatal place it seems to me. Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O brother, with the dismall'st object hurtThat ever eye with sight made heart lament!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] Now will I fetch the king to find them here,That he thereby may give a likely guessHow these were they that made away his brother.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why dost not comfort me, and help me outFrom this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am surprised with an uncouth fear;A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,Aaron and thou look down into this den,And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart Will not permit mine eyes once to behold The thing whereat it trembles by surmise; O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till now Was I a child to fear I know not what.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Upon his bloody finger he doth wear A precious ring, that lightens all the hole, Which, like a taper in some monument, Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks, And shows the ragged entrails of the pit: So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood. O brother, help me with thy fainting hand— If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath— Out of this fell devouring receptacle, As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out; Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good, I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave. I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,Till thou art here aloft, or I below:Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Along with me: I'll see what hole is here, And what he is that now is leap'd into it. Say who art thou that lately didst descend Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The unhappy son of old Andronicus:Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest: He and his lady both are at the lodge Upon the north side of this pleasant chase; 'Tis not an hour since I left him there.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We know not where you left him all alive;But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where is my lord the king?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where is thy brother Bassianus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then all too late I bring this fatal writ, The complot of this timeless tragedy; And wonder greatly that man's face can fold In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Reads] 'An if we miss to meet him handsomely— Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean— Do thou so much as dig the grave for him: Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward Among the nettles at the elder-tree Which overshades the mouth of that same pit Where we decreed to bury Bassianus. Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.' O Tamora! was ever heard the like? This is the pit, and this the elder-tree. Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out That should have murdered Bassianus here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To TITUS] Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind, Have here bereft my brother of his life. Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison: There let them bide until we have devised Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!How easily murder is discovered!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* High emperor, upon my feeble knee I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed, That this fell fault of my accursed sons, Accursed if the fault be proved in them,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If it be proved! you see it is apparent.Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Andronicus himself did take it up.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail; For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow They shall be ready at your highness' will To answer their suspicion with their lives.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me. Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers: Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain; For, by my soul, were there worse end than death, That end upon them should be executed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Andronicus, I will entreat the king;Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* See, how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;And so let's leave her to her silent walks.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An 'twere my case, I should go hang myself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast! Cousin, a word; where is your husband? If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me! If I do wake, some planet strike me down, That I may slumber in eternal sleep! Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments, Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in, And might not gain so great a happiness As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me? Alas, a crimson river of warm blood, Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind, Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips, Coming and going with thy honey breath. But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee, And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue. Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame! And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood, As from a conduit with three issuing spouts, Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face Blushing to be encountered with a cloud. Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so? O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast, That I might rail at him, to ease my mind! Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd, Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is. Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue, And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind: But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee; A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met, And he hath cut those pretty fingers off, That could have better sew'd than Philomel. O, had the monster seen those lily hands Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute, And make the silken strings delight to kiss them, He would not then have touch'd them for his life! Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony Which that sweet tongue hath made, He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet. Come, let us go, and make thy father blind; For such a sight will blind a father's eye: One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads; What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes? Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee O, could our mourning ease thy misery!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay! For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept; For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed; For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd; And for these bitter tears, which now you see Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks; Be pitiful to my condemned sons, Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought. For two and twenty sons I never wept, Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears: Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite; My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush. O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain, That shall distil from these two ancient urns, Than youthful April shall with all his showers: In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still; In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow And keep eternal spring-time on thy face, So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men! Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death; And let me say, that never wept before, My tears are now prevailing orators.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O noble father, you lament in vain:The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear, They would not mark me, or if they did mark, They would not pity me, yet plead I must; Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones; Who, though they cannot answer my distress, Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes, For that they will not intercept my tale: When I do weep, they humbly at my feet Receive my tears and seem to weep with me; And, were they but attired in grave weeds, Rome could afford no tribune like to these. A stone is soft as wax,—tribunes more hard than stones; A stone is silent, and offendeth not, And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To rescue my two brothers from their death:For which attempt the judges have pronouncedMy everlasting doom of banishment.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O happy man! they have befriended thee. Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers? Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey But me and mine: how happy art thou, then, From these devourers to be banished! But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will it consume me? let me see it, then.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This was thy daughter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, Marcus, so she is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay me, this object kills me!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her. Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight? What fool hath added water to the sea, Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy? My grief was at the height before thou camest, And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds. Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too; For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain; And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life; In bootless prayer have they been held up, And they have served me to effectless use: Now all the service I require of them Is that the one will help to cut the other. 'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands; For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, that delightful engine of her thoughts That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence, Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage, Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, thus I found her, straying in the park,Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deerThat hath received some unrecuring wound.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It was my deer; and he that wounded her Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead: For now I stand as one upon a rock Environed with a wilderness of sea, Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave, Expecting ever when some envious surge Will in his brinish bowels swallow him. This way to death my wretched sons are gone; Here stands my other son, a banished man, And here my brother, weeping at my woes. But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn, Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul. Had I but seen thy picture in this plight, It would have madded me: what shall I do Now I behold thy lively body so? Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears: Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee: Thy husband he is dead: and for his death Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this. Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her! When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;Perchance because she knows them innocent.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them. No, no, they would not do so foul a deed; Witness the sorrow that their sister makes. Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips. Or make some sign how I may do thee ease: Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius, And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain, Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry, With miry slime left on them by a flood? And in the fountain shall we gaze so long Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness, And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears? Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine? Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows Pass the remainder of our hateful days? What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues, Plot some deuce of further misery, To make us wonder'd at in time to come.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wotThy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs: Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say That to her brother which I said to thee: His napkin, with his true tears all bewet, Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks. O, what a sympathy of woe is this, As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor Sends thee this word,—that, if thou love thy sons, Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus, Or any one of you, chop off your hand, And send it to the king: he for the same Will send thee hither both thy sons alive; And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron! Did ever raven sing so like a lark, That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise? With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand: Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine, That hath thrown down so many enemies, Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn: My youth can better spare my blood than you; And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Which of your hands hath not defended Rome, And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe, Writing destruction on the enemy's castle? O, none of both but are of high desert: My hand hath been but idle; let it serve To ransom my two nephews from their death; Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,For fear they die before their pardon come.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My hand shall go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By heaven, it shall not go!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as theseAre meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And, for our father's sake and mother's care,Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then I'll go fetch an axe.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But I will use the axe.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest, And never, whilst I live, deceive men so: But I'll deceive you in another sort, And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd. Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand: Tell him it was a hand that warded him From thousand dangers; bid him bury it More hath it merited; that let it have. As for my sons, say I account of them As jewels purchased at an easy price; And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand Look by and by to have thy sons with thee. [Aside] Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it! Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace. Aaron will have his soul black like his face.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven, And bow this feeble ruin to the earth: If any power pities wretched tears, To that I call! [To LAVINIA] What, wilt thou kneel with me? Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers; Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim, And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O brother, speak with possibilities,And do not break into these deep extremes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?Then be my passions bottomless with them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But yet let reason govern thy lament.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If there were reason for these miseries, Then into limits could I bind my woes: When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow? If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad, Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face? And wilt thou have a reason for this coil? I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow! She is the weeping welkin, I the earth: Then must my sea be moved with her sighs; Then must my earth with her continual tears Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd; For why my bowels cannot hide her woes, But like a drunkard must I vomit them. Then give me leave, for losers will have leave To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor. Here are the heads of thy two noble sons; And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back; Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock'd; That woe is me to think upon thy woes More than remembrance of my father's death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily, And be my heart an ever-burning hell! These miseries are more than may be borne. To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal; But sorrow flouted at is double death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound, And yet detested life not shrink thereat! That ever death should let life bear his name, Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortlessAs frozen water to a starved snake.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* When will this fearful slumber have an end?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus; Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons' heads, Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here: Thy other banish'd son, with this dear sight Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I, Even like a stony image, cold and numb. Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs: Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight The closing up of our most wretched eyes; Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha, ha, ha!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, I have not another tear to shed: Besides, this sorrow is an enemy, And would usurp upon my watery eyes And make them blind with tributary tears: Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave? For these two heads do seem to speak to me, And threat me I shall never come to bliss Till all these mischiefs be return'd again Even in their throats that have committed them. Come, let me see what task I have to do. You heavy people, circle me about, That I may turn me to each one of you, And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs. The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head; And in this hand the other I will bear. Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms! Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth. As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight; Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay: Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there: And, if you love me, as I think you do, Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Farewell Andronicus, my noble father, The wofull'st man that ever lived in Rome: Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again, He leaves his pledges dearer than his life: Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister; O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been! But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives But in oblivion and hateful griefs. If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs; And make proud Saturnine and his empress Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen. Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power, To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more Than will preserve just so much strength in us As will revenge these bitter woes of ours. Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot: Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands, And cannot passionate our tenfold grief With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine Is left to tyrannize upon my breast; Who, when my heart, all mad with misery, Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh, Then thus I thump it down. [To LAVINIA] Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs! When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating, Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still. Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans; Or get some little knife between thy teeth, And just against thy heart make thou a hole; That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall May run into that sink, and soaking in Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to laySuch violent hands upon her tender life.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now! has sorrow made thee dote already? Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I. What violent hands can she lay on her life? Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands; To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er, How Troy was burnt and he made miserable? O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands, Lest we remember still that we have none. Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk, As if we should forget we had no hands, If Marcus did not name the word of hands! Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this: Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says; I can interpret all her martyr'd signs; She says she drinks no other drink but tears, Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks: Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought; In thy dumb action will I be as perfect As begging hermits in their holy prayers: Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven, Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign, But I of these will wrest an alphabet And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,And tears will quickly melt thy life away.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* At that that I have kill'd, my lord; a fly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart; Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny: A deed of death done on the innocent Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone: I see thou art not for my company.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But how, if that fly had a father and mother? How would he hang his slender gilded wings, And buzz lamenting doings in the air! Poor harmless fly, That, with his pretty buzzing melody, Came here to make us merry! and thou hast kill'd him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favor'd fly,Like to the empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, O, O, Then pardon me for reprehending thee, For thou hast done a charitable deed. Give me thy knife, I will insult on him; Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor Come hither purposely to poison me.— There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora. Ah, sirrah! Yet, I think, we are not brought so low, But that between us we can kill a fly That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,He takes false shadows for true substances.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me: I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee Sad stories chanced in the times of old. Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young, And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia Follows me every where, I know not why: Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes. Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean: See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee: Somewhither would she have thee go with her. Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care Read to her sons than she hath read to thee Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess, Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her: For I have heard my grandsire say full oft, Extremity of griefs would make men mad; And I have read that Hecuba of Troy Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear; Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did, And would not, but in fury, fright my youth: Which made me down to throw my books, and fly— Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt: And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go, I will most willingly attend your ladyship.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lucius, I will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this? Some book there is that she desires to see. Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy. But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd Come, and take choice of all my library, And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed. Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I think she means that there was more than oneConfederate in the fact: ay, more there was;Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;My mother gave it me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* For love of her that's gone,Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read? This is the tragic tale of Philomel, And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape: And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl, Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was, Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see! Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt— O, had we never, never hunted there!— Pattern'd by that the poet here describes, By nature made for murders and for rapes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, why should nature build so foul a den,Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends, What Roman lord it was durst do the deed: Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst, That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me. Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury, Inspire me, that I may this treason find! My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia: This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst This after me, when I have writ my name Without the help of any hand at all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift! Write thou good niece; and here display, at last, What God will have discover'd for revenge; Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain, That we may know the traitors and the truth!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, what! the lustful sons of TamoraPerformers of this heinous, bloody deed?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Magni Dominator poli,Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know There is enough written upon this earth To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts And arm the minds of infants to exclaims. My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel; And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope; And swear with me, as, with the woful fere And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame, Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape, That we will prosecute by good advice Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths, And see their blood, or die with this reproach.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis sure enough, an you knew how. But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware: The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once, She's with the lion deeply still in league, And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back, And when he sleeps will she do what she list. You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone; And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass, And with a gad of steel will write these words, And lay it by: the angry northern wind Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad, And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I say, my lord, that if I were a man,Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safeFor these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oftFor his ungrateful country done the like.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, go with me into mine armoury; Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy, Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons Presents that I intend to send them both: Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course. Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house: Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court: Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O heavens, can you hear a good man groan, And not relent, or not compassion him? Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy, That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield; But yet so just that he will not revenge. Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;He hath some message to deliver us.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lords, with all the humbleness I may, I greet your honours from Andronicus. [Aside] And pray the Roman gods confound you both!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] That you are both decipher'd, that's the news, For villains mark'd with rape.— May it please you, My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me The goodliest weapons of his armoury To gratify your honourable youth, The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say; And so I do, and with his gifts present Your lordships, that, whenever you have need, You may be armed and appointed well: And so I leave you both: [Aside] like bloody villains.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What's here? A scroll; and written round about? Let's see; [Reads] 'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus, Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:I read it in the grammar long ago.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it. [Aside] Now, what a thing it is to be an ass! Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt; And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines, That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick. But were our witty empress well afoot, She would applaud Andronicus' conceit: But let her rest in her unrest awhile. And now, young lords, was't not a happy star Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so, Captives, to be advanced to this height? It did me good, before the palace gate To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But me more good, to see so great a lordBasely insinuate and send us gifts.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?Did you not use his daughter very friendly?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would we had a thousand Roman damesAt such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A charitable wish and full of love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And that would she for twenty thousand more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, let us go; and pray to all the godsFor our beloved mother in her pains.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Soft! who comes here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good morr ow, lords:O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!She is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To whom?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I mean, she is brought a-bed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A devil.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue: Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime: The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal, And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Villain, what hast thou done?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That which thou canst not undo.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou hast undone our mother.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Villain, I have done thy mother.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It shall not live.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It shall not die.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, must it, nurse? then let no man but IDo execution on my flesh and blood.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother? Now, by the burning tapers of the sky, That shone so brightly when this boy was got, He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point That touches this my first-born son and heir! I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus, With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood, Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war, Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands. What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys! Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs! Coal-black is better than another hue, In that it scorns to bear another hue; For all the water in the ocean Can never turn the swan's black legs to white, Although she lave them hourly in the flood. Tell the empress from me, I am of age To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My mistress is my mistress; this myself, The vigour and the picture of my youth: This before all the world do I prefer; This maugre all the world will I keep safe, Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By this our mother is forever shamed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I blush to think upon this ignomy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears: Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing The close enacts and counsels of the heart! Here's a young lad framed of another leer: Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father, As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.' He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed Of that self-blood that first gave life to you, And from that womb where you imprison'd were He is enfranchised and come to light: Nay, he is your brother by the surer side, Although my seal be stamped in his face.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,And we will all subscribe to thy advice:Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then sit we down, and let us all consult.My son and I will have the wind of you:Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How many women saw this child of his?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league, I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor, The chafed boar, the mountain lioness, The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms. But say, again; how many saw the child?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cornelia the midwife and myself;And no one else but the deliver'd empress.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The empress, the midwife, and yourself:Two may keep counsel when the third's away:Go to the empress, tell her this I said.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy: Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours, A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no: And now be it known to you my full intent. Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman; His wife but yesternight was brought to bed; His child is like to her, fair as you are: Go pack with him, and give the mother gold, And tell them both the circumstance of all; And how by this their child shall be advanced, And be received for the emperor's heir, And substituted in the place of mine, To calm this tempest whirling in the court; And let the emperor dandle him for his own. Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And you must needs bestow her funeral; The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms: This done, see that you take no longer days, But send the midwife presently to me. The midwife and the nurse well made away, Then let the ladies tattle what they please.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the airWith secrets.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* For this care of Tamora,Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies; There to dispose this treasure in mine arms, And secretly to greet the empress' friends. Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence; For it is you that puts us to our shifts: I'll make you feed on berries and on roots, And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat, And cabin in a cave, and bring you up To be a warrior, and command a camp.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way. Sir boy, now let me see your archery; Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight. Terras Astraea reliquit: Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled. Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets; Happily you may catch her in the sea; Yet there's as little justice as at land: No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it; 'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade, And pierce the inmost centre of the earth: Then, when you come to Pluto's region, I pray you, deliver him this petition; Tell him, it is for justice and for aid, And that it comes from old Andronicus, Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome. Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable What time I threw the people's suffrages On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me. Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all, And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd: This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence; And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Publius, is not this a heavy case,To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns By day and night to attend him carefully, And feed his humour kindly as we may, Till time beget some careful remedy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy. Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude, And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Publius, how now! how now, my masters!What, have you met with her?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word, If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall: Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd, He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else, So that perforce you must needs stay a time.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He doth me wrong to feed me with delays. I'll dive into the burning lake below, And pull her out of Acheron by the heels. Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size; But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back, Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear: And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell, We will solicit heaven and move the gods To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs. Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Ad Jovem,' that's for you: here, 'Ad Apollinem:' 'Ad Martem,' that's for myself: Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury: To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine; You were as good to shoot against the wind. To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid. Of my word, I have written to effect; There's not a god left unsolicited.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:We will afflict the emperor in his pride.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, masters, draw.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, well said, Lucius!Good boy, in Virgo's lap; give it Pallas.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha, ha!Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot, The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court; And who should find them but the empress' villain? She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose But give them to his master for a present.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath takenthem down again, for the man must not be hanged tillthe next week.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with himin all my life.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there God forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperorwith a grace?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado, But give your pigeons to the emperor: By me thou shalt have justice at his hands. Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges. Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace deliver a supplication?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then here is a supplication for you. And when you come to him, at the first approach you must kneel, then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see you do it bravely.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I warrant you, sir, let me alone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it. Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration; For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant. And when thou hast given it the emperor, Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* God be with you, sir; I will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen An emperor in Rome thus overborne, Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent Of equal justice, used in such contempt? My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods, However these disturbers of our peace Buzz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd, But even with law, against the willful sons Of old Andronicus. And what an if His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits, Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks, His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness? And now he writes to heaven for his redress: See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury; This to Apollo; this to the god of war; Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome! What's this but libelling against the senate, And blazoning our injustice every where? A goodly humour, is it not, my lords? As who would say, in Rome no justice were. But if I live, his feigned ecstasies Shall be no shelter to these outrages: But he and his shall know that justice lives In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep, He'll so awake as she in fury shall Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine, Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts, Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age, The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons, Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart; And rather comfort his distressed plight Than prosecute the meanest or the best For these contempts. [Aside] Why, thus it shall become High-witted Tamora to gloze with all: But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick, Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise, Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go, take him away, and hang him presently.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How much money must I have?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck toa fair end.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Despiteful and intolerable wrongs! Shall I endure this monstrous villany? I know from whence this same device proceeds: May this be borne?— as if his traitorous sons, That died by law for murder of our brother, Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully! Go, drag the villain hither by the hair; Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege: For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman; Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great, In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What news with thee, AEmilius?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Arm, arm, my lord;—Rome never had more cause. The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power high-resolved men, bent to the spoil, They hither march amain, under conduct Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus; Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do As much as ever Coriolanus did.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths? These tidings nip me, and I hang the head As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms: Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach: 'Tis he the common people love so much; Myself hath often over-heard them say, When I have walked like a private man, That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully, And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why should you fear? is not your city strong?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,And will revolt from me to succor him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name. Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it? The eagle suffers little birds to sing, And is not careful what they mean thereby, Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody: Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome. Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor, I will enchant the old Andronicus With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous, Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep, When as the one is wounded with the bait, The other rotted with delicious feed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But he will not entreat his son for us.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If Tamora entreat him, then he will: For I can smooth and fill his aged ear With golden promises; that, were his heart Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf, Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue. [To AEMILIUS] Go thou before, be our ambassador: Say that the emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* AEmilius, do this message honourably:And if he stand on hostage for his safety,Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your bidding shall I do effectually.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now will I to that old Andronicus; And temper him with all the art I have, To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths. And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again, And bury all thy fear in my devices.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then go successantly, and plead to him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Approved warriors, and my faithful friends, I have received letters from great Rome, Which signify what hate they bear their emperor And how desirous of our sight they are. Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness, Imperious and impatient of your wrongs, And wherein Rome hath done you any scath, Let him make treble satisfaction.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus, Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort; Whose high exploits and honourable deeds Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt, Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st, Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day Led by their master to the flowered fields, And be avenged on cursed Tamora.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And as he saith, so say we all with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd To gaze upon a ruinous monastery; And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building, suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall. I made unto the noise; when soon I heard The crying babe controll'd with this discourse: 'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam! Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art, Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look, Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor: But where the bull and cow are both milk-white, They never do beget a coal-black calf. Peace, villain, peace!'—even thus he rates the babe,— 'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth; Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe, Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.' With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him, Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither, To use as you think needful of the man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand; This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye, And here's the base fruit of his burning lust. Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey This growing image of thy fiend-like face? Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word? A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree. And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Too like the sire for ever being good. First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl; A sight to vex the father's soul withal. Get me a ladder.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lucius, save the child, And bear it from me to the empress. If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things, That highly may advantage thee to hear: If thou wilt not, befall what may befall, I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'stThy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius, 'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak; For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres, Acts of black night, abominable deeds, Complots of mischief, treason, villanies Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd: And this shall all be buried by my death, Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not; Yet, for I know thou art religious And hast a thing within thee called conscience, With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies, Which I have seen thee careful to observe, Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know An idiot holds his bauble for a god And keeps the oath which by that god he swears, To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow By that same god, what god soe'er it be, That thou adorest and hast in reverence, To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up; Or else I will discover nought to thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* First know thou, I begot him on the empress.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity To that which thou shalt hear of me anon. 'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus; They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twasTrim sport for them that had the doing of it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them: That codding spirit had they from their mother, As sure a card as ever won the set; That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me, As true a dog as ever fought at head. Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth. I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay: I wrote the letter that thy father found And hid the gold within the letter mention'd, Confederate with the queen and her two sons: And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue, Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it? I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand, And, when I had it, drew myself apart And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter: I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads; Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily, That both mine eyes were rainy like to his : And when I told the empress of this sport, She swooned almost at my pleasing tale, And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, that I had not done a thousand more. Even now I curse the day—and yet, I think, Few come within the compass of my curse,— Wherein I did not some notorious ill, As kill a man, or else devise his death, Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it, Accuse some innocent and forswear myself, Set deadly enmity between two friends, Make poor men's cattle break their necks; Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night, And bid the owners quench them with their tears. Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves, And set them upright at their dear friends' doors, Even when their sorrows almost were forgot; And on their skins, as on the bark of trees, Have with my knife carved in Roman letters, 'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.' Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things As willingly as one would kill a fly, And nothing grieves me heartily indeed But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Bring down the devil; for he must not dieSo sweet a death as hanging presently.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If there be devils, would I were a devil, To live and burn in everlasting fire, So I might have your company in hell, But to torment you with my bitter tongue!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, there is a messenger from RomeDesires to be admitted to your presence.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let him come near.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Welcome, AEmilius what's the news from Rome?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths, The Roman emperor greets you all by me; And, for he understands you are in arms, He craves a parley at your father's house, Willing you to demand your hostages, And they shall be immediately deliver'd.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What says our general?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledgesUnto my father and my uncle Marcus,And we will come. March away.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment, I will encounter with Andronicus, And say I am Revenge, sent from below To join with him and right his heinous wrongs. Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps, To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge; Tell him Revenge is come to join with him, And work confusion on his enemies.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who doth molest my contemplation? Is it your trick to make me ope the door, That so my sad decrees may fly away, And all my study be to no effect? You are deceived: for what I mean to do See here in bloody lines I have set down; And what is written shall be executed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,Wanting a hand to give it action?Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am not mad; I know thee well enough: Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines; Witness these trenches made by grief and care, Witness the tiring day and heavy night; Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well For our proud empress, mighty Tamora: Is not thy coming for my other hand?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora; She is thy enemy, and I thy friend: I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom, To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind, By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes. Come down, and welcome me to this world's light; Confer with me of murder and of death: There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place, No vast obscurity or misty vale, Where bloody murder or detested rape Can couch for fear, but I will find them out; And in their ears tell them my dreadful name, Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,To be a torment to mine enemies?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do me some service, ere I come to thee. Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands; Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge, Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels; And then I'll come and be thy waggoner, And whirl along with thee about the globe. Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet, To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away, And find out murderers in their guilty caves: And when thy car is loaden with their heads, I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel Trot, like a servile footman, all day long, Even from Hyperion's rising in the east Until his very downfall in the sea: And day by day I'll do this heavy task, So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* These are my ministers, and come with me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are! And you, the empress! but we worldly men Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes. O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee; And, if one arm's embracement will content thee, I will embrace thee in it by and by.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This closing with him fits his lunacy Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits, Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches, For now he firmly takes me for Revenge; And, being credulous in this mad thought, I'll make him send for Lucius his son; And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure, I'll find some cunning practise out of hand, To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths, Or, at the least, make them his enemies. See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee: Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house: Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too. How like the empress and her sons you are! Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor: Could not all hell afford you such a devil? For well I wot the empress never wags But in her company there is a Moor; And, would you represent our queen aright, It were convenient you had such a devil: But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Show me a villain that hath done a rape,And I am sent to be revenged on him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,And I will be revenged on them all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Look round about the wicked streets of Rome; And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself. Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer. Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap To find another that is like to thee, Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher. Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court There is a queen, attended by a Moor; Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion, for up and down she doth resemble thee: I pray thee, do on them some violent death; They have been violent to me and mine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do. But would it please thee, good Andronicus, To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son, Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths, And bid him come and banquet at thy house; When he is here, even at thy solemn feast, I will bring in the empress and her sons, The emperor himself and all thy foes; And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel, And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart. What says Andronicus to this device?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius; Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths: Bid him repair to me, and bring with him Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths; Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are: Tell him the emperor and the empress too Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them. This do thou for my love; and so let him, As he regards his aged father's life.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This will I do, and soon return again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now will I hence about thy business,And take my ministers along with me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;Or else I'll call my brother back again,And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside to her sons] What say you, boys? will you bide with him, Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor How I have govern'd our determined jest? Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair, And tarry with him till I turn again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] I know them all, though they suppose me mad,And will o'erreach them in their own devices:A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goesTo lay a complot to betray thy foes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tut, I have work enough for you to do.Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is your will?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Know you these two?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived; The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name; And therefore bind them, gentle Publius. Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them. Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour, And now I find it; therefore bind them sure, And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And therefore do we what we are commanded.Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound. Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me; But let them hear what fearful words I utter. O villains, Chiron and Demetrius! Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud, This goodly summer with your winter mix'd. You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death, My hand cut off and made a merry jest; Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity, Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced. What would you say, if I should let you speak? Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace. Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you. This one hand yet is left to cut your throats, Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold The basin that receives your guilty blood. You know your mother means to feast with me, And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad: Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust And with your blood and it I'll make a paste, And of the paste a coffin I will rear And make two pasties of your shameful heads, And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam, Like to the earth swallow her own increase. This is the feast that I have bid her to, And this the banquet she shall surfeit on; For worse than Philomel you used my daughter, And worse than Progne I will be revenged: And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Receive the blood: and when that they are dead, Let me go grind their bones to powder small And with this hateful liquor temper it; And in that paste let their vile heads be baked. Come, come, be every one officious To make this banquet; which I wish may prove More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast. So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook, And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mindThat I repair to Rome, I am content.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor, This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil; Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him Till he be brought unto the empress' face, For testimony of her foul proceedings: And see the ambush of our friends be strong; I fear the emperor means no good to us.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forthThe venomous malice of my swelling heart!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, hath the firmament more suns than one?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle; These quarrels must be quietly debated. The feast is ready, which the careful Titus Hath ordain'd to an honourable end, For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome: Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marcus, we will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen; Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius; And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor, 'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Because I would be sure to have all well,To entertain your highness and your empress.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An if your highness knew my heart, you were. My lord the emperor, resolve me this: Was it well done of rash Virginius To slay his daughter with his own right hand, Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It was, Andronicus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your reason, mighty lord?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Because the girl should not survive her shame,And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A reason mighty, strong, and effectual; A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant, For me, most wretched, to perform the like. Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind. I am as woful as Virginius was, And have a thousand times more cause than he To do this outrage: and it now is done.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will't please you eat? will't please yourhighness feed?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go fetch them hither to us presently.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, there they are both, baked in that pie; Whereof their mother daintily hath fed, Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred. 'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome, By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts, O, let me teach you how to knit again This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf, These broken limbs again into one body; Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself, And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to, Like a forlorn and desperate castaway, Do shameful execution on herself. But if my frosty signs and chaps of age, Grave witnesses of true experience, Cannot induce you to attend my words, [To Lucius] Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor, When with his solemn tongue he did discourse To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear The story of that baleful burning night When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy, Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears, Or who hath brought the fatal engine in That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound. My heart is not compact of flint nor steel; Nor can I utter all our bitter grief, But floods of tears will drown my oratory, And break my utterance, even in the time When it should move you to attend me most, Lending your kind commiseration. Here is a captain, let him tell the tale; Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then, noble auditory, be it known to you, That cursed Chiron and Demetrius Were they that murdered our emperor's brother; And they it were that ravished our sister: For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded; Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out, And sent her enemies unto the grave. Lastly, myself unkindly banished, The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out, To beg relief among Rome's enemies: Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears. And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend. I am the turned forth, be it known to you, That have preserved her welfare in my blood; And from her bosom took the enemy's point, Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body. Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I; My scars can witness, dumb although they are, That my report is just and full of truth. But, soft! methinks I do digress too much, Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me; For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Of this was Tamora delivered; The issue of an irreligious Moor, Chief architect and plotter of these woes: The villain is alive in Titus' house, And as he is, to witness this is true. Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience, Or more than any living man could bear. Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans? Have we done aught amiss,—show us wherein, And, from the place where you behold us now, The poor remainder of Andronici Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down. And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains, And make a mutual closure of our house. Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall, Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome, And bring our emperor gently in thy hand, Lucius our emperor; for well I know The common voice do cry it shall be so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house, [To Attendants] And hither hale that misbelieving Moor, To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death, As punishment for his most wicked life.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so, To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe! But, gentle people, give me aim awhile, For nature puts me to a heavy task: Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near, To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk. O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,The last true duties of thy noble son!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss, Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips: O were the sum of these that I should pay Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well: Many a time he danced thee on his knee, Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow: Many a matter hath he told to thee, Meet and agreeing with thine infancy; In that respect, then, like a loving child, Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring, Because kind nature doth require it so: Friends should associate friends in grief and woe: Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave; Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart Would I were dead, so you did live again! O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping; My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You sad Andronici, have done with woes:Give sentence on this execrable wretch,That hath been breeder of these dire events.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him; There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food; If any one relieves or pities him, For the offence he dies. This is our doom: Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb? I am no baby, I, that with base prayers I should repent the evils I have done: Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did Would I perform, if I might have my will; If one good deed in all my life I did, I do repent it from my very soul.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Some loving friends convey the emperor hence, And give him burial in his father's grave: My father and Lavinia shall forthwith Be closed in our household's monument. As for that heinous tiger, Tamora, No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weeds, No mournful bell shall ring her burial; But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey: Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity; And, being so, shall have like want of pity. See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor, By whom our heavy haps had their beginning: Then, afterwards, to order well the state, That like events may ne'er it ruinate.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed, Have to the port of Athens sent their ships, Fraught with the ministers and instruments Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen, With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel. To Tenedos they come; And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city, Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien, And Antenorides, with massy staples And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts, Sperr up the sons of Troy. Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits, On one and other side, Trojan and Greek, Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited In like conditions as our argument, To tell you, fair beholders, that our play Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils, Beginning in the middle, starting thence away To what may be digested in a play. Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are: Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again: Why should I war without the walls of Troy, That find such cruel battle here within? Each Trojan that is master of his heart, Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will this gear ne'er be mended?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength, Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant; But I am weaker than a woman's tear, Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance, Less valiant than the virgin in the night And skilless as unpractised infancy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part, I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have I not tarried?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, the grinding; but you must tarrythe bolting.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have I not tarried?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Still have I tarried.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word 'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be, Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do. At Priam's royal table do I sit; And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,— So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I sawher look, or any woman else.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I was about to tell thee:— when my heart, As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain, Lest Hector or my father should perceive me, I have, as when the sun doth light a storm, Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile: But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness, Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's— well, go to—there were no more comparison between the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,— When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd, Reply not in how many fathoms deep They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;' Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice, Handlest in thy discourse , O, that her hand, In whose comparison all whites are ink, Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me, As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her; But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm, Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me The knife that made it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I speak no more than truth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou dost not speak so much.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she benot, she has the mends in her own hands.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and between, but small thanks for my labour.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Say I she is not fair?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part, I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pandarus,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not I.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet Pandarus,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as Ifound it, and there an end.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds! Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair, When with your blood you daily paint her thus. I cannot fight upon this argument; It is too starved a subject for my sword. But Pandarus,—O gods, how do you plague me! I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar; And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo. As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit. Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love, What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we? Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl: Between our Ilium and where she resides, Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood, Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,For womanish it is to be from thence.What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That Paris is returned home and hurt.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By whom, AEneas?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Troilus, by Menelaus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In all swift haste.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, go we then together.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who were those went by?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Queen Hecuba and Helen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And whither go they?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Up to the eastern tower, Whose height commands as subject all the vale, To see the battle. Hector, whose patience Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved: He chid Andromache and struck his armourer, And, like as there were husbandry in war, Before the sun rose he was harness'd light, And to the field goes he; where every flower Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw In Hector's wrath.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What was his cause of anger?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The noise goes, this: there is among the GreeksA lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;They call him Ajax.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good; and what of him?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They say he is a very man per se,And stands alone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But how should this man, that makesme smile, make Hector angry?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle andstruck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hathever since kept Hector fasting and waking.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who comes here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, your uncle Pandarus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hector's a gallant man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As may be in the world, lady.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What's that? what's that?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? Whenwere you at Ilium?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This morning, uncle.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What were you talking of when I came? Was Hectorarmed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was notup, was she?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Even so: Hector was stirring early.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That were we talking of, and of his anger.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Was he angry?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So he says here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, is he angry too?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know aman if you see him?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So he is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is not Hector.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Excuse me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is elder.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pardon me, pardon me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me anothertale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall nothave his wit this year.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He shall not need it, if he have his own.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor his qualities.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No matter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor his beauty.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Twould not become him; his own's better.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You have no judgment, niece: Helen herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for a brown favour—for so 'tis, I must confess,— not brown neither,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, but brown.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To say the truth, true and not true.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She praised his complexion above Paris.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, Paris hath colour enough.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So he has.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised him above, his complexion is higher than his; he having colour enough, and the other higher, is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' otherday into the compassed window,—and, you know, hehas not past three or four hairs on his chin,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring hisparticulars therein to a total.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, he is very young: and yet will he, withinthree pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she cameand puts me her white hand to his cloven chin—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smilingbecomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, he smiles valiantly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Does he not?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helenloves Troilus,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'llprove it so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteeman addle egg.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idlehead, you would eat chickens i' the shell.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickledhis chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, Imust needs confess,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Without the rack.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughedthat her eyes ran o'er.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* With mill-stones.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And Cassandra laughed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But there was more temperate fire under the pot ofher eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And Hector laughed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* At what was all this laughing?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An't had been a green hair, I should have laughedtoo.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What was his answer?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on yourchin, and one of them is white.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is her question.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.' 'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris, my husband?' 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing! and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the rest so laughed, that it passed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So let it now; for it has been while going by.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So I do.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twerea man born in April.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettleagainst May.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hark! they are coming from the field: shall westand up here, and see them as they pass towardIlium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* At your pleasure.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we maysee most bravely: I'll tell you them all by theirnames as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Speak not so loud.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one ofthe flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but markTroilus; you shall see anon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who's that?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person. When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if he see me, you shall see him nod at me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will he give you the nod?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You shall see.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If he do, the rich shall have more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a fellow ! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man, niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's a countenance! is't not a brave man?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, a brave man!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do you see? look you there: there's no jesting; there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say: there be hacks!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be those with swords?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil cometo him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one'sheart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who's that?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That'sHelenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Can Helenus fight, uncle?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. Imarvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear thepeople cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! theprince of chivalry!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Peace, for shame, peace!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks, and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way! Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess, he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris? Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to change, would give an eye to boot.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here come more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran! porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and all Greece.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood, learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality, and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no datein the pie, for then the man's date's out.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward youlie.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a thousand watches.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Say one of your watches.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's past watching.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You are such another!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* At your own house; there he unarms him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good boy, tell him I come.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Adieu, uncle.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll be with you, niece, by and by.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To bring, uncle?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, a token from Troilus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By the same token, you are a bawd.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice, He offers in another's enterprise; But more in Troilus thousand fold I see Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be; Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing: Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing. That she beloved knows nought that knows not this: Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is: That she was never yet that ever knew Love got so sweet as when desire did sue. Therefore this maxim out of love I teach: Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech: Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear, Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Princes, What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks? The ample proposition that hope makes In all designs begun on earth below Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd, As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap, Infect the sound pine and divert his grain Tortive and errant from his course of growth. Nor, princes, is it matter new to us That we come short of our suppose so far That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand; Sith every action that hath gone before, Whereof we have record, trial did draw Bias and thwart, not answering the aim, And that unbodied figure of the thought That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes, Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works, And call them shames? which are indeed nought else But the protractive trials of great Jove To find persistive constancy in men: The fineness of which metal is not found In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward, The wise and fool, the artist and unread, The hard and soft seem all affined and kin: But, in the wind and tempest of her frown, Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan, Puffing at all, winnows the light away; And what hath mass or matter, by itself Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* With due observance of thy godlike seat, Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth, How many shallow bauble boats dare sail Upon her patient breast, making their way With those of nobler bulk! But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage The gentle Thetis, and anon behold The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut, Bounding between the two moist elements, Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled, Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks, And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize, And with an accent tuned in selfsame key Retorts to chiding fortune.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Agamemnon, Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece, Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit. In whom the tempers and the minds of all Should be shut up , hear what Ulysses speaks. Besides the applause and approbation To which,
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* most mighty for thy place and sway,
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life I give to both your speeches, which were such As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece Should hold up high in brass, and such again As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver, Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both, Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect That matter needless, of importless burden, Divide thy lips, than we are confident, When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws, We shall hear music, wit and oracle .
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down, And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master, But for these instances. The specialty of rule hath been neglected: And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions. When that the general is not like the hive To whom the foragers shall all repair, What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded, The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask. The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre Observe degree, priority and place, Insisture, course, proportion, season, form, Office and custom, in all line of order; And therefore is the glorious planet Sol In noble eminence enthroned and sphered Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil, And posts, like the commandment of a king, Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets In evil mixture to disorder wander, What plagues and what portents! what mutiny! What raging of the sea! shaking of earth! Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors, Divert and crack, rend and deracinate The unity and married calm of states Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked, Which is the ladder to all high designs, Then enterprise is sick! How could communities, Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities, Peaceful commerce from dividable shores, The primogenitive and due of birth, Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels, But by degree, stand in authentic place? Take but degree away, untune that string, And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores And make a sop of all this solid globe: Strength should be lord of imbecility, And the rude son should strike his father dead: Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong, Between whose endless jar justice resides, Should lose their names, and so should justice too. Then every thing includes itself in power, Power into will, will into appetite; And appetite, an universal wolf, So doubly seconded with will and power, Must make perforce an universal prey, And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon, This chaos, when degree is suffocate, Follows the choking. And this neglection of degree it is That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd By him one step below, he by the next, That next by him beneath; so every step, Exampled by the first pace that is sick Of his superior, grows to an envious fever Of pale and bloodless emulation: And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot, Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length, Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'dThe fever whereof all our power is sick.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,What is the remedy?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns The sinew and the forehand of our host, Having his ear full of his airy fame, Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus Upon a lazy bed the livelong day Breaks scurril jests; And with ridiculous and awkward action, Which, slanderer, he imitation calls, He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon, Thy topless deputation he puts on, And, like a strutting player, whose conceit Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich To hear the wooden dialogue and sound 'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,— Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks, 'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared, Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling, From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause; Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just. Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard, As he being drest to some oration.' That's done, as near as the extremest ends Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife: Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent! 'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus, Arming to answer in a night alarm.' And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit, And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget, Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus; Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion, All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes, Severals and generals of grace exact, Achievements, plots, orders, preventions, Excitements to the field, or speech for truce, Success or loss, what is or is not, serves As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And in the imitation of these twain— Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns With an imperial voice—many are infect. Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head In such a rein, in full as proud a place As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him; Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war, Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites, A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint, To match us in comparisons with dirt, To weaken and discredit our exposure, How rank soever rounded in with danger.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They tax our policy, and call it cowardice, Count wisdom as no member of the war, Forestall prescience, and esteem no act But that of hand: the still and mental parts, That do contrive how many hands shall strike, When fitness calls them on, and know by measure Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,— Why, this hath not a finger's dignity: They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war; So that the ram that batters down the wall, For the great swing and rudeness of his poise, They place before his hand that made the engine, Or those that with the fineness of their souls By reason guide his execution.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let this be granted, and Achilles' horseMakes many Thetis' sons.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What trumpet? look, Menelaus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* From Troy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What would you 'fore our tent?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Even this.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* May one, that is a herald and a prince,Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* With surety stronger than Achilles' arm'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voiceCall Agamemnon head and general.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fair leave and large security. How mayA stranger to those most imperial looksKnow them from eyes of other mortals?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay; I ask, that I might waken reverence, And bid the cheek be ready with a blush Modest as morning when she coldly eyes The youthful Phoebus: Which is that god in office, guiding men? Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This Trojan scorns us; or the men of TroyAre ceremonious courtiers.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd, As bending angels; that's their fame in peace: But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls, Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and, Jove's accord, Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas, Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips! The worthiness of praise distains his worth, If that the praised himself bring the praise forth: But what the repining enemy commends, That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure, transcends.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, Greek, that is my name.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What's your affair I pray you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,To set his sense on the attentive bent,And then to speak.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Speak frankly as the wind; It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour: That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake, He tells thee so himself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Trumpet, blow loud, Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents; And every Greek of mettle, let him know, What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy A prince call'd Hector,—Priam is his father,— Who in this dull and long-continued truce Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet, And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords! If there be one among the fair'st of Greece That holds his honour higher than his ease, That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril, That knows his valour, and knows not his fear, That loves his mistress more than in confession, With truant vows to her own lips he loves, And dare avow her beauty and her worth In other arms than hers,—to him this challenge. Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks, Shall make it good, or do his best to do it, He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer, Than ever Greek did compass in his arms, And will to-morrow with his trumpet call Midway between your tents and walls of Troy, To rouse a Grecian that is true in love: If any come, Hector shall honour him; If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires, The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas; If none of them have soul in such a kind, We left them all at home: but we are soldiers; And may that soldier a mere recreant prove, That means not, hath not, or is not in love! If then one is, or hath, or means to be, That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now; But if there be not in our Grecian host One noble man that hath one spark of fire, To answer for his love, tell him from me I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn, And meeting him will tell him that my lady Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste As may be in the world: his youth in flood, I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Amen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand; To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir. Achilles shall have word of this intent; So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent: Yourself shall feast with us before you go And find the welcome of a noble foe.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nestor!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What says Ulysses?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have a young conception in my brain;Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is't?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This 'tis: Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride That hath to this maturity blown up In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd, Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil, To overbulk us all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, and how?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,However it is spread in general name,Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The purpose is perspicuous even as substance, Whose grossness little characters sum up: And, in the publication, make no strain, But that Achilles, were his brain as barren As banks of Libya,—though, Apollo knows, 'Tis dry enough,—will, with great speed of judgment, Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose Pointing on him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And wake him to the answer, think you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose, That can from Hector bring his honour off, If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat, Yet in the trial much opinion dwells; For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses, Our imputation shall be oddly poised In this wild action; for the success, Although particular, shall give a scantling Of good or bad unto the general; And in such indexes, although small pricks To their subsequent volumes, there is seen The baby figure of the giant mass Of things to come at large. It is supposed He that meets Hector issues from our choice And choice, being mutual act of all our souls, Makes merit her election, and doth boil, As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd Out of our virtues; who miscarrying, What heart receives from hence the conquering part, To steel a strong opinion to themselves? Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments, In no less working than are swords and bows Directive by the limbs.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give pardon to my speech: Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector. Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares, And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not, The lustre of the better yet to show, Shall show the better. Do not consent That ever Hector and Achilles meet; For both our honour and our shame in this Are dogg'd with two strange followers.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What glory our Achilles shares from Hector, Were he not proud, we all should share with him: But he already is too insolent; And we were better parch in Afric sun Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes, Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd, Why then, we did our main opinion crush In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery; And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves Give him allowance for the better man; For that will physic the great Myrmidon Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends. If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off, We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail, Yet go we under our opinion still That we have better men. But, hit or miss, Our project's life this shape of sense assumes: Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ulysses, Now I begin to relish thy advice; And I will give a taste of it forthwith To Agamemnon: go we to him straight. Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thersites!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,generally?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thersites!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And those boils did run? say so: did not thegeneral run then? were not that a botchy core?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dog!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Feel, then.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrelbeef-witted lord!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I willbeat thee into handsomeness.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but, I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book . Thou canst strike, canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The proclamation!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the scratching of thee; I would make thee the loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I say, the proclamation!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,and thou art as full of envy at his greatness asCerberus is at Proserpine's beauty, ay, that thoubarkest at him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Mistress Thersites!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou shouldest strike him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cobloaf!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as asailor breaks a biscuit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Beating him] You whoreson cur!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do, do.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou stool for a witch!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinego may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave. If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel, and tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no bowels, thou!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You dog!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You scurvy lord!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Beating him] You cur!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Mars his idiot! do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,Thersites! what's the matter, man?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You see him there, do you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay; what's the matter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, look upon him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So I do: what's the matter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, but regard him well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Well!' why, I do so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever youtake him to be, he is Ajax.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know that, fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, but that fool knows not himself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Therefore I beat thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord, Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I say, this Ajax—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, good Ajax.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Has not so much wit—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, I must hold you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom hecomes to fight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Peace, fool!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would have peace and quietness, but the fool willnot: he there: that he: look you there.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O thou damned cur! I shall—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you set your wit to a fool's?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, I warrant you; for a fool's will shame it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good words, Thersites.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What's the quarrel?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of theproclamation, and he rails upon me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I serve thee not.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, go to, go to.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I serve here voluntarily.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your last service was sufferance, 'twas notvoluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax washere the voluntary, and you as under an impress.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* E'en so; a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a' were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, with me too, Thersites?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldyere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke youlike draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, what?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I shall cut out your tongue.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thouafterwards.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No more words, Thersites; peace!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There's for you, Patroclus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I comeany more to your tents: I will keep where there iswit stirring and leave the faction of fools.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A good riddance.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host: That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun, Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy To-morrow morning call some knight to arms That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare Maintain—I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Farewell. Who shall answer him?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwiseHe knew his man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* After so many hours, lives, speeches spent, Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks: 'Deliver Helen, and all damage else— As honour, loss of time, travail, expense, Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed In hot digestion of this cormorant war— Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I As far as toucheth my particular, Yet, dread Priam, There is no lady of more softer bowels, More spongy to suck in the sense of fear, More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?' Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety, Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go: Since the first sword was drawn about this question, Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes, Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours: If we have lost so many tenths of ours, To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us, Had it our name, the value of one ten, What merit's in that reason which denies The yielding of her up?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fie, fie, my brother! Weigh you the worth and honour of a king So great as our dread father in a scale Of common ounces? will you with counters sum The past proportion of his infinite? And buckle in a waist most fathomless With spans and inches so diminutive As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons, You are so empty of them. Should not our father Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons, Because your speech hath none that tells him so?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest; You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons: You know an enemy intends you harm; You know a sword employ'd is perilous, And reason flies the object of all harm: Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds A Grecian and his sword, if he do set The very wings of reason to his heels And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove, Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason, Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat their thoughts With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Brother, she is not worth what she doth costThe holding.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is aught, but as 'tis valued?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But value dwells not in particular will; It holds his estimate and dignity As well wherein 'tis precious of itself As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry To make the service greater than the god And the will dotes that is attributive To what infectiously itself affects, Without some image of the affected merit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I take to-day a wife, and my election Is led on in the conduct of my will; My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears, Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores Of will and judgment: how may I avoid, Although my will distaste what it elected, The wife I chose? there can be no evasion To blench from this and to stand firm by honour: We turn not back the silks upon the merchant, When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands We do not throw in unrespective sieve, Because we now are full. It was thought meet Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks: Your breath of full consent bellied his sails; The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired, And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive, He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning. Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt: Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl, Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships, And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants. If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went— As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'— If you'll confess he brought home noble prize— As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands And cried 'Inestimable!'—why do you now The issue of your proper wisdoms rate, And do a deed that fortune never did, Beggar the estimation which you prized Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base, That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep! But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n, That in their country did them that disgrace, We fear to warrant in our native place!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Within] Cry, Trojans, cry!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What noise? what shriek is this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Within] Cry, Trojans!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is Cassandra.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Peace, sister, peace!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld, Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry, Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes A moiety of that mass of moan to come. Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears! Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand; Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all. Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe: Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains Of divination in our sister work Some touches of remorse? or is your blood So madly hot that no discourse of reason, Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause, Can qualify the same?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, brother Hector, We may not think the justness of each act Such and no other than event doth form it, Nor once deject the courage of our minds, Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel Which hath our several honours all engaged To make it gracious. For my private part, I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons: And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us Such things as might offend the weakest spleen To fight for and maintain!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Else might the world convince of levity As well my undertakings as your counsels: But I attest the gods, your full consent Gave wings to my propension and cut off All fears attending on so dire a project. For what, alas, can these my single arms? What Propugnation is in one man's valour, To stand the push and enmity of those This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest, Were I alone to pass the difficulties And had as ample power as I have will, Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done, Nor faint in the pursuit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Paris, you speak Like one besotted on your sweet delights: You have the honey still, but these the gall; So to be valiant is no praise at all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, I propose not merely to myself The pleasures such a beauty brings with it; But I would have the soil of her fair rape Wiped off, in honourable keeping her. What treason were it to the ransack'd queen, Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me, Now to deliver her possession up On terms of base compulsion! Can it be That so degenerate a strain as this Should once set footing in your generous bosoms? There's not the meanest spirit on our party Without a heart to dare or sword to draw When Helen is defended, nor none so noble Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed Where Helen is the subject; then, I say, Well may we fight for her whom, we know well, The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Paris and Troilus, you have both said well, And on the cause and question now in hand Have glozed, but superficially: not much Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought Unfit to hear moral philosophy: The reasons you allege do more conduce To the hot passion of distemper'd blood Than to make up a free determination 'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice Of any true decision. Nature craves All dues be render'd to their owners: now, What nearer debt in all humanity Than wife is to the husband? If this law Of nature be corrupted through affection, And that great minds, of partial indulgence To their benumbed wills, resist the same, There is a law in each well-order'd nation To curb those raging appetites that are Most disobedient and refractory. If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king, As it is known she is, these moral laws Of nature and of nations speak aloud To have her back return'd: thus to persist In doing wrong extenuates not wrong, But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless, My spritely brethren, I propend to you In resolution to keep Helen still, For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance Upon our joint and several dignities.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, there you touch'd the life of our design: Were it not glory that we more affected Than the performance of our heaving spleens, I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector, She is a theme of honour and renown, A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds, Whose present courage may beat down our foes, And fame in time to come canonize us; For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose So rich advantage of a promised glory As smiles upon the forehead of this action For the wide world's revenue.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am yours, You valiant offspring of great Priamus. I have a roisting challenge sent amongst The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits: I was advertised their great general slept, Whilst emulation in the army crept: This, I presume, will wake him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction! would it were otherwise; that I could beat him, whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less than little wit from them that they have! which short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that, methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars. Amen. Where's Achilles?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay: the heavens hear me!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who's there?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thersites, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, mydigestion, why hast thou not served thyself in tomy table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,what's Achilles?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,what's thyself?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,what art thou?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou mayst tell that knowest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, tell, tell.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commandsAchilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'knower, and Patroclus is a fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You rascal!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Peace, fool! I have not done.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersitesis a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Derive this; come.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles; Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon; Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and Patroclus is a fool positive.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why am I a fool?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thouart. Look you, who comes here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.Come in with me, Thersites.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here is such patchery, such juggling and such knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on the subject! and war and lechery confound all!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where is Achilles?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Within his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let it be known to him that we are here. He shent our messengers; and we lay by Our appertainments, visiting of him: Let him be told so; lest perchance he think We dare not move the question of our place, Or know not what we are.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I shall say so to him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We saw him at the opening of his tent:He is not sick.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call itmelancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by myhead, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us thecause. A word, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who, Thersites?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, you see, he is his argument that has hisargument, Achilles.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* All the better; their fraction is more our wish thantheir faction: but it was a strong composure a foolcould disunite.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easilyuntie. Here comes Patroclus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No Achilles with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry, If any thing more than your sport and pleasure Did move your greatness and this noble state To call upon him; he hopes it is no other But for your health and your digestion sake, And after-dinner's breath.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hear you, Patroclus: We are too well acquainted with these answers: But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn, Cannot outfly our apprehensions. Much attribute he hath, and much the reason Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues, Not virtuously on his own part beheld, Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss, Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish, Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him, We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin, If you do say we think him over-proud And under-honest, in self-assumption greater Than in the note of judgment; and worthier than himself Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on, Disguise the holy strength of their command, And underwrite in an observing kind His humorous predominance; yea, watch His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if The passage and whole carriage of this action Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add, That if he overhold his price so much, We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine Not portable, lie under this report: 'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war: A stirring dwarf we do allowance give Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I shall; and bring his answer presently.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In second voice we'll not be satisfied;We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is he more than another?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No more than what he thinks he is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself abetter man than I am?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No question.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, aswise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogethermore tractable.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? Iknow not what pride is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours the deed in the praise.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside] Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What's his excuse?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He doth rely on none,But carries on the stream of his disposeWithout observance or respect of any,In will peculiar and in self-admission.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why will he not upon our fair requestUntent his person and share the air with us?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Things small as nothing, for request's sake only, He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness, And speaks not to himself but with a pride That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse That 'twixt his mental and his active parts Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages And batters down himself: what should I say? He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it Cry 'No recovery.'
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let Ajax go to him.Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:'Tis said he holds you well, and will be ledAt your request a little from himself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Agamemnon, let it not be so! We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord That bastes his arrogance with his own seam And never suffers matter of the world Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd Of that we hold an idol more than he? No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired; Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit, As amply titled as Achilles is, By going to Achilles: That were to enlard his fat already pride And add more coals to Cancer when he burns With entertaining great Hyperion. This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid, And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside to DIOMEDES] O, this is well; he rubs thevein of him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside to NESTOR] And how his silence drinks upthis applause!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, no, you shall not go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:Let me go to him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A paltry, insolent fellow!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How he describes himself!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Can he not be sociable?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The raven chides blackness.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll let his humours blood.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He will be the physician that should be the patient.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An all men were o' my mind,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wit would be out of fashion.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:shall pride carry it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An 'twould, you'ld carry half.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A' would have ten shares.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will knead him; I'll make him supple.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To AGAMEMNON] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Our noble general, do not do so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.Here is a man—but 'tis before his face;I will be silent.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wherefore should you so?He is not emulous, as Achilles is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Know the whole world, he is as valiant.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!Would he were a Trojan!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What a vice were it in Ajax now,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If he were proud,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Or covetous of praise,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, or surly borne,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Or strange, or self-affected!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure; Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck: Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature Thrice famed, beyond all erudition: But he that disciplined thy arms to fight, Let Mars divide eternity in twain, And give him half: and, for thy vigour, Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom, Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor; Instructed by the antiquary times, He must, he is, he cannot but be wise: Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd, You should not have the eminence of him, But be as Ajax.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Shall I call you father?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, my good son.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles Keeps thicket . Please it our great general To call together all his state of war; Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow We must with all our main of power stand fast: And here's a lord,—come knights from east to west, And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Friend, you! pray you, a word: do not you followthe young Lord Paris?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You depend upon him, I mean?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, I do depend upon the lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You depend upon a noble gentleman; I must needspraise him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The lord be praised!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You know me, do you not?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Faith, sir, superficially.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I hope I shall know your honour better.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do desire it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You are in the state of grace.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What music is this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Know you the musicians?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wholly, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who play they to?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To the hearers, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* At whose pleasure, friend
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Command, I mean, friend.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who shall I command, sir?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Friend, we understand not one another: I am toocourtly and thou art too cunning. At whose requestdo these men play?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request of Paris my lord, who's there in person; with him, the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's invisible soul,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who, my cousin Cressida?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by herattributes?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault upon him, for my business seethes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair company! fair desires, in all fair measure, fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen! fair thoughts be your fair pillow!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fairprince, here is good broken music.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full of harmony.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Truly, lady, no.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, sir,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,will you vouchsafe me a word?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear yousing, certainly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemedfriend, your brother Troilus,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go to, sweet queen, to go:—commends himself mostaffectionately to you,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,our melancholy upon your head!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not, in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no, no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My Lord Pandarus,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, but, my lord,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall outwith you. You must not know where he sups.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, yourdisposer is sick.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, I'll make excuse.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,your poor disposer's sick.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I spy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me aninstrument. Now, sweet queen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, this is kindly done.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,sweet queen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll singyou a song now.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thouhast a fine forehead.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, you may, you may.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In good troth, it begins so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Love, love, nothing but love, still more! For, O, love's bow Shoots buck and doe: The shaft confounds, Not that it wounds, But tickles still the sore. These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die! Yet that which seems the wound to kill, Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he! So dying love lives still: Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha! Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha! Heigh-ho!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot blood. Hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers: is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's a-field to-day?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the gallantry of Troy: I would fain have armed to-day, but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my brother Troilus went not?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how theysped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To a hair.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Farewell, sweet queen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Commend me to your niece.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will, sweet queen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall, To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles, With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd, Shall more obey than to the edge of steel Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more Than all the island kings,—disarm great Hector.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris; Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty Gives us more palm in beauty than we have, Yea, overshines ourself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet, above thought I love thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now! where's thy master? at my cousinCressida's?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, here he comes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, how now!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sirrah, walk off.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have you seen my cousin?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door, Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon, And give me swift transportance to those fields Where I may wallow in the lily-beds Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus, From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings And fly with me to Cressid!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am giddy; expectation whirls me round. The imaginary relish is so sweet That it enchants my sense: what will it be, When that the watery palate tastes indeed Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me, Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine, Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness, For the capacity of my ruder powers: I fear it much; and I do fear besides, That I shall lose distinction in my joys; As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps The enemy flying.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest villain: she fetches her breath as short as a new-ta'en sparrow.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom: My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse; And all my powers do their bestowing lose, Like vassalage at unawares encountering The eye of majesty.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby. Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again? you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you? Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward, we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner. So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now! a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the ducks i' the river: go to, go to.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You have bereft me of all words, lady.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your activity in question. What, billing again? Here's 'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'— Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you walk in, my lord?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wished, my lord! The gods grant,—O my lord!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What should they grant? what makes this prettyabruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweetlady in the fountain of our love?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds saferfooting than blind reason stumbling without fear: tofear the worst oft cures the worse.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid'spageant there is presented no monster.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor nothing monstrous neither?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed. This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will is infinite and the execution confined, that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform, vowing more than the perfection often and discharging less than the tenth part of one. They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares, are they not monsters?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present: we will not name desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can speak truest not truer than Troilus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you walk in, my lord?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if heflinch, chide me for it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and myfirm faith.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred, though they be long ere they are wooed, they are constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you; they'll stick where they are thrown.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and dayFor many weary months.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord, With the first glance that ever—pardon me— If I confess much, you will play the tyrant. I love you now; but not, till now, so much But I might master it: in faith, I lie; My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools! Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us, When we are so unsecret to ourselves? But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not; And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man, Or that we women had men's privilege Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue, For in this rapture I shall surely speak The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence, Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pretty, i' faith.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me; 'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss: I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done? For this time will I take my leave, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your leave, sweet Cressid!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pray you, content you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What offends you, lady?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, mine own company.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You cannot shun yourself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let me go and try: I have a kind of self resides with you; But an unkind self, that itself will leave, To be another's fool. I would be gone: Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love; And fell so roundly to a large confession, To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise, Or else you love not, for to be wise and love Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O that I thought it could be in a woman— As, if it can, I will presume in you— To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love; To keep her constancy in plight and youth, Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind That doth renew swifter than blood decays! Or that persuasion could but thus convince me, That my integrity and truth to you Might be affronted with the match and weight Of such a winnow'd purity in love; How were I then uplifted! but, alas! I am as true as truth's simplicity And simpler than the infancy of truth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In that I'll war with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O virtuous fight, When right with right wars who shall be most right! True swains in love shall in the world to come Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes, Full of protest, of oath and big compare, Want similes, truth tired with iteration, As true as steel, as plantage to the moon, As sun to day, as turtle to her mate, As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre, Yet, after all comparisons of truth, As truth's authentic author to be cited, 'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse, And sanctify the numbers.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Prophet may you be! If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth, When time is old and hath forgot itself, When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy, And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up, And mighty states characterless are grated To dusty nothing, yet let memory, From false to false, among false maids in love, Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth, As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf, Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,' 'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood, 'As false as Cressid.'
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's. If ever you prove false one to another, since I have taken such pains to bring you together, let all pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end after my name; call them all Pandars; let all constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids, and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Amen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Amen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your pretty encounters, press it to death: away! And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, princes, for the service I have done you, The advantage of the time prompts me aloud To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind That, through the sight I bear in things to love, I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession, Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself, From certain and possess'd conveniences, To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all That time, acquaintance, custom and condition Made tame and most familiar to my nature, And here, to do you service, am become As new into the world, strange, unacquainted: I do beseech you, as in way of taste, To give me now a little benefit, Out of those many register'd in promise, Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor, Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear. Oft have you—often have you thanks therefore— Desired my Cressid in right great exchange, Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor, I know, is such a wrest in their affairs That their negotiations all must slack, Wanting his manage; and they will almost Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam, In change of him: let him be sent, great princes, And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence Shall quite strike off all service I have done, In most accepted pain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let Diomedes bear him, And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have What he requests of us. Good Diomed, Furnish you fairly for this interchange: Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burdenWhich I am proud to bear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent: Please it our general to pass strangely by him, As if he were forgot; and, princes all, Lay negligent and loose regard upon him: I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him: If so, I have derision medicinable, To use between your strangeness and his pride, Which his own will shall have desire to drink: It may be good: pride hath no other glass To show itself but pride, for supple knees Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We'll execute your purpose, and put on A form of strangeness as we pass along: So do each lord, and either greet him not, Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, comes the general to speak with me?You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would you, my lord, aught with the general?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nothing, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The better.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good day, good day.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How do you? how do you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, does the cuckold scorn me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, Patroclus!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good morrow, Ajax.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good morrow.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, and good next day too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They pass by strangely: they were used to bendTo send their smiles before them to Achilles;To come as humbly as they used to creepTo holy altars.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, am I poor of late? 'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune, Must fall out with men too: what the declined is He shall as soon read in the eyes of others As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies, Show not their mealy wings but to the summer, And not a man, for being simply man, Hath any honour, but honour for those honours That are without him, as place, riches, favour, Prizes of accident as oft as merit: Which when they fall, as being slippery standers, The love that lean'd on them as slippery too, Do one pluck down another and together Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me: Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy At ample point all that I did possess, Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out Something not worth in me such rich beholding As they have often given. Here is Ulysses; I'll interrupt his reading. How now Ulysses!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, great Thetis' son!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What are you reading?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A strange fellow here Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted, How much in having, or without or in, Cannot make boast to have that which he hath, Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection; As when his virtues shining upon others Heat them and they retort that heat again To the first giver.'
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is not strange, Ulysses. The beauty that is borne here in the face The bearer knows not, but commends itself To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself, That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself, Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed Salutes each other with each other's form; For speculation turns not to itself, Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do not strain at the position,— It is familiar,—but at the author's drift; Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves That no man is the lord of any thing, Though in and of him there be much consisting, Till he communicate his parts to others: Nor doth he of himself know them for aught Till he behold them form'd in the applause Where they're extended; who, like an arch, reverberates The voice again, or, like a gate of steel Fronting the sun, receives and renders back His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this; And apprehended here immediately The unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse, That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are Most abject in regard and dear in use! What things again most dear in the esteem And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow— An act that very chance doth throw upon him— Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do, While some men leave to do! How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall, Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes! How one man eats into another's pride, While pride is fasting in his wantonness! To see these Grecian lords!— why, even already They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder, As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast And great Troy shrieking.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do believe it; for they pass'd by meAs misers do by beggars, neither gave to meGood word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back, Wherein he puts alms for oblivion, A great-sized monster of ingratitudes: Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd As fast as they are made, forgot as soon As done: perseverance, dear my lord, Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail In monumental mockery. Take the instant way; For honour travels in a strait so narrow, Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path; For emulation hath a thousand sons That one by one pursue: if you give way, Or hedge aside from the direct forthright, Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by And leave you hindmost; Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank, Lie there for pavement to the abject rear, O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present, Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours; For time is like a fashionable host That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand, And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly, Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles, And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek Remuneration for the thing it was; For beauty, wit, High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service, Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all To envious and calumniating time. One touch of nature makes the whole world kin, That all with one consent praise new-born gawds, Though they are made and moulded of things past, And give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt o'er-dusted. The present eye praises the present object. Then marvel not, thou great and complete man, That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax; Since things in motion sooner catch the eye Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee, And still it might, and yet it may again, If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive And case thy reputation in thy tent; Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late, Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves And drave great Mars to faction.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Of this my privacyI have strong reasons.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But 'gainst your privacy The reasons are more potent and heroical: 'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love With one of Priam's daughters.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha! known!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is that a wonder? The providence that's in a watchful state Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold, Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps, Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods, Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles. There is a mystery—with whom relation Durst never meddle—in the soul of state; Which hath an operation more divine Than breath or pen can give expressure to: All the commerce that you have had with Troy As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord; And better would it fit Achilles much To throw down Hector than Polyxena: But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home, When fame shall in our islands sound her trump, And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing, 'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win, But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.' Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak; The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you: A woman impudent and mannish grown Is not more loathed than an effeminate man In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this; They think my little stomach to the war And your great love to me restrains you thus: Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold, And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane, Be shook to air.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I see my reputation is at stakeMy fame is shrewdly gored.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, then, beware; Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves: Omission to do what is necessary Seals a commission to a blank of danger; And danger, like an ague, subtly taints Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus: I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him To invite the Trojan lords after the combat To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing, An appetite that I am sick withal, To see great Hector in his weeds of peace, To talk with him and to behold his visage, Even to my full of view.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A labour saved!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A wonder!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How so?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is soprophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that heraves in saying nothing.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How can that be?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,—a stride and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning: bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;' and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show without knocking. The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow, Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think you of this man that takes me for the general? He's grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster. A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both sides, like a leather jerkin.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not answering: speaking is for beggars ; he wears his tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the pageant of Ajax.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon, et cetera. Do this.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Jove bless great Ajax!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hum!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I come from the worthy Achilles,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hum!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Agamemnon!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What say you to't?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* God b' wi' you, with all my heart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your answer, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it willgo one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for meere he has me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your answer, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fare you well, with all my heart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the morecapable creature.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;And I myself see not the bottom of it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be atick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* See, ho! who is that there?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is the Lord AEneas.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is the prince there in person? Had I so good occasion to lie long As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A valiant Greek, AEneas,—take his hand,— Witness the process of your speech, wherein You told how Diomed, a whole week by days, Did haunt you in the field.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Health to you, valiant sir, During all question of the gentle truce; But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance As heart can think or courage execute.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The one and other Diomed embraces. Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health! But when contention and occasion meet, By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life With all my force, pursuit and policy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly With his face backward. In humane gentleness, Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life, Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear, No man alive can love in such a sort The thing he means to kill more excellently.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live, If to my sword his fate be not the glory, A thousand complete courses of the sun! But, in mine emulous honour, let him die, With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We know each other well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We do; and long to know each other worse.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.What business, lord, so early?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek To Calchas' house, and there to render him, For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid: Let's have your company, or, if you please,Haste there before us: I constantly do think—Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge—My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:Rouse him and give him note of our approach.With the whole quality wherefore: I fearWe shall be much unwelcome.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That I assure you:Troilus had rather Troy were borne to GreeceThan Cressid borne from Troy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There is no help;The bitter disposition of the timeWill have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good morrow, all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,Myself or Menelaus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Both alike:He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,Not making any scruple of her soilure,With such a hell of pain and world of charge,And you as well to keep her, that defend her,Not palating the taste of her dishonour,With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:He, like a puling cuckold, would drink upThe lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;You, like a lecher, out of whorish loinsAre pleased to breed out your inheritors:Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;But he as he, the heavier for a whore.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:For every false drop in her bawdy veinsA Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scrupleOf her contaminated carrion weight,A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,She hath not given so many good words breathAs for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:But we in silence hold this virtue well,We'll but commend what we intend to sell.Here lies our way.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;He shall unbolt the gates.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Trouble him not; To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes, And give as soft attachment to thy senses As infants' empty of all thought!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good morrow, then.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I prithee now, to bed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Are you a-weary of me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Cressida! but that the busy day,Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,I would not from thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Night hath been too brief.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love With wings more momentary-swift than thought. You will catch cold, and curse me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Prithee, tarry: You men will never tarry. O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off, And then you would have tarried. Hark! there's one up.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Within] What, 's all the doors open here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is your uncle.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:I shall have such a life!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, youmaid! where's my cousin Cressid?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To do what? to do what? let her saywhat: what have I brought you to do?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,Nor suffer others.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia! hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.My lord, come you again into my chamber:You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha, ha!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who's there? what's the matter? will you beatdown the door? How now! what's the matter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,I knew you not: what news with you so early?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is not Prince Troilus here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here! what should he do here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:It doth import him much to speak with me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'llbe sworn: for my own part, I came in late. Whatshould he do here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who!—nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go fetch him hither; go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now! what's the matter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you, My matter is so rash: there is at hand Paris your brother, and Deiphobus, The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith, Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour, We must give up to Diomedes' hand The Lady Cressida.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is it so concluded?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By Priam and the general state of Troy:They are at hand and ready to effect it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How my achievements mock me!I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,We met by chance; you did not find me here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good, good, my lord; the secrets of natureHave not more gift in taciturnity.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke's neck!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now! what's the matter? who was here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ah, ah!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O the gods! what's the matter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er beenborn! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poorgentleman! A plague upon Antenor!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,what's the matter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father, and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death; 'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O you immortal gods! I will not go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou must.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father; I know no touch of consanguinity; No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine! Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood, If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death, Do to this body what extremes you can; But the strong base and building of my love Is as the very centre of the earth, Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do, do.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heartWith sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd Of her delivery to this valiant Greek Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus, Tell you the lady what she is to do, And haste her to the purpose.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Walk into her house; I'll bring her to the Grecian presently: And to his hand when I deliver her, Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus A priest there offering to it his own heart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know what 'tis to love;And would, as I shall pity, I could help!Please you walk in, my lords.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be moderate, be moderate.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why tell you me of moderation? The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste, And violenteth in a sense as strong As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it? If I could temporize with my affection, Or brew it to a weak and colder palate, The like allayment could I give my grief. My love admits no qualifying dross; No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here, here, here he comes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ah, sweet ducks!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Troilus! Troilus!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What a pair of spectacles is here! Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is, '—O heart, heavy heart, Why sigh'st thou without breaking? where he answers again, 'Because thou canst not ease thy smart By friendship nor by speaking.' There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away nothing, for we may live to have need of such a verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity, That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy, More bright in zeal than the devotion which Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have the gods envy?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And is it true that I must go from Troy?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A hateful truth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, and from Troilus too?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* From Troy and Troilus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is it possible?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And suddenly; where injury of chance Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows Even in the birth of our own labouring breath: We two, that with so many thousand sighs Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves With the rude brevity and discharge of one. Injurious time now with a robber's haste Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how: As many farewells as be stars in heaven, With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them, He fumbles up into a loose adieu, And scants us with a single famish'd kiss, Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Within] My lord, is the lady ready?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die. Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, ormy heart will be blown up by the root.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I must then to the Grecians?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No remedy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!When shall we see again?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, we must use expostulation kindly, For it is parting from us: I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee, For I will throw my glove to Death himself, That there's no maculation in thy heart: But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in My sequent protestation; be thou true, And I will see thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangersAs infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And you this glove. When shall I see you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,To give thee nightly visitation.But yet be true.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O heavens! 'be true' again!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hear while I speak it, love: The Grecian youths are full of quality; They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature, Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise: How novelty may move, and parts with person, Alas, a kind of godly jealousy— Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin— Makes me afeard.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O heavens! you love me not.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Die I a villain, then! In this I do not call your faith in question So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing, Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk, Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all, To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant: But I can tell that in each grace of these There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do you think I will?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No. But something may be done that we will not: And sometimes we are devils to ourselves, When we will tempt the frailty of our powers, Presuming on their changeful potency.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Within] Nay, good my lord,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, kiss; and let us part.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Within] Brother Troilus!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good brother, come you hither;And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, will you be true?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault: Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion, I with great truth catch mere simplicity; Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns, With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare. Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady Which for Antenor we deliver you: At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand, And by the way possess thee what she is. Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek, If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword, Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe As Priam is in Ilion.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fair Lady Cressid, So please you, save the thanks this prince expects: The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek, Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously, To shame the zeal of my petition to thee In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece, She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant. I charge thee use her well, even for my charge; For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not, Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard, I'll cut thy throat.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, be not moved, Prince Troilus: Let me be privileged by my place and message, To be a speaker free; when I am hence I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord, I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,' I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed, This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head. Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk, To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hark! Hector's trumpet.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How have we spent this morning!The prince must think me tardy and remiss,That swore to ride before him to the field.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let us make ready straight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity, Let us address to tend on Hector's heels: The glory of our Troy doth this day lie On his fair worth and single chivalry.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair, Anticipating time with starting courage. Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy, Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air May pierce the head of the great combatant And hale him hither.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou, trumpet, there's my purse. Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe: Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon: Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood; Thou blow'st for Hector.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No trumpet answers.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis but early days.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;He rises on the toe: that spirit of hisIn aspiration lifts him from the earth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is this the Lady Cressid?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Even she.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yet is the kindness but particular;'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.So much for Nestor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:Achilles bids you welcome.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I had good argument for kissing once.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But that's no argument for kissing now;For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,And parted thus you and your argument.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:Patroclus kisses you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, this is trim!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In kissing, do you render or receive?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Both take and give.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll make my match to live,The kiss you take is better than you give;Therefore no kiss.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You're an odd man; give even or give none.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An odd man, lady! every man is odd.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,That you are odd, and he is even with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You fillip me o' the head.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, I'll be sworn.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It were no match, your nail against his horn.May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You may.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do desire it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, beg, then.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,When Helen is a maid again, and his.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A woman of quick sense.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fie, fie upon her! There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip, Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out At every joint and motive of her body. O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue, That give accosting welcome ere it comes, And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts To every ticklish reader! set them down For sluttish spoils of opportunity And daughters of the game.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The Trojans' trumpet.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yonder comes the troop.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done To him that victory commands? or do you purpose A victor shall be known? will you the knights Shall to the edge of all extremity Pursue each other, or shall be divided By any voice or order of the field? Hector bade ask.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Which way would Hector have it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He cares not; he'll obey conditions.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,A little proudly, and great deal misprizingThe knight opposed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If not Achilles, sir,What is your name?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If not Achilles, nothing.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this: In the extremity of great and little, Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector; The one almost as infinite as all, The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well, And that which looks like pride is courtesy. This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood: In love whereof, half Hector stays at home; Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight, Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas Consent upon the order of their fight, So be it; either to the uttermost, Or else a breath: the combatants being kin Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They are opposed already.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The youngest son of Priam, a true knight, Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word, Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue; Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd: His heart and hand both open and both free; For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows; Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty, Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath; Manly as Hector, but more dangerous; For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes To tender objects, but he in heat of action Is more vindicative than jealous love: They call him Troilus, and on him erect A second hope, as fairly built as Hector. Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth Even to his inches, and with private soul Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They are in action.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, Ajax, hold thine own!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hector, thou sleep'st;Awake thee!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You must no more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Princes, enough, so please you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As Hector pleases.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, then will I no more: Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son, A cousin-german to great Priam's seed; The obligation of our blood forbids A gory emulation 'twixt us twain: Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all, And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent, Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member Wherein my sword had not impressure made Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother, My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax: By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms; Hector would have them fall upon him thus: Cousin, all honour to thee!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I thank thee, Hector Thou art too gentle and too free a man: I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence A great addition earned in thy death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not Neoptolemus so mirable, On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There is expectance here from both the sides,What further you will do.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We'll answer it;The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I might in entreaties find success— As seld I have the chance— I would desire My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great AchillesDoth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me, And signify this loving interview To the expecters of our Trojan part; Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin; I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The worthiest of them tell me name by name; But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes Shall find him by his large and portly size.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one That would be rid of such an enemy; But that's no welcome: understand more clear, What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks And formless ruin of oblivion; But in this extant moment, faith and troth, Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing, Bids thee, with most divine integrity, From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To TROILUS] My well-famed lord of Troy, noless to you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who must we answer?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The noble Menelaus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks! Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath; Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove: She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, pardon; I offend.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft Labouring for destiny make cruel way Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee, As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed, Despising many forfeits and subduements, When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air, Not letting it decline on the declined, That I have said to some my standers by 'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!' And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath, When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in, Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen; But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel, I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire, And once fought with him: he was a soldier good; But, by great Mars, the captain of us all, Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee; And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis the old Nestor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would my arms could match thee in contention,As they contend with thee in courtesy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would they could.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha!By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I wonder now how yonder city standsWhen we have here her base and pillar by us.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well. Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead, Since first I saw yourself and Diomed In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue: My prophecy is but half his journey yet; For yonder walls, that pertly front your town, Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds, Must kiss their own feet.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I must not believe you: There they stand yet, and modestly I think, The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all, And that old common arbitrator, Time, Will one day end it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So to him we leave it. Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome: After the general, I beseech you next To feast with me and see me at my tent.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou! Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee; I have with exact view perused thee, Hector, And quoted joint by joint.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is this Achilles?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am Achilles.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Behold thy fill.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, I have done already.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou art too brief: I will the second time,As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er; But there's more in me than thou understand'st. Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there? That I may give the local wound a name And make distinct the very breach whereout Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It would discredit the blest gods, proud man, To answer such a question: stand again: Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly As to prenominate in nice conjecture Where thou wilt hit me dead?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I tell thee, yea.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wert thou an oracle to tell me so, I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well; For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there; But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm, I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er. You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag; His insolence draws folly from my lips; But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words, Or may I never—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do not chafe thee, cousin: And you, Achilles, let these threats alone, Till accident or purpose bring you to't: You may have every day enough of Hector If you have stomach; the general state, I fear, Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I pray you, let us see you in the field:We have had pelting wars, since you refusedThe Grecians' cause.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dost thou entreat me, Hector?To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;To-night all friends.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy hand upon that match.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent; There in the full convive we: afterwards, As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall Concur together, severally entreat him. Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow, That this great soldier may his welcome know.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus: There Diomed doth feast with him to-night; Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth, But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view On the fair Cressid.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,After we part from Agamemnon's tent,To bring me thither?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You shall command me, sir. As gentle tell me, of what honour was This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there That wails her absence?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord? She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth: But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here comes Thersites.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, thou core of envy!Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idolof idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* From whence, fragment?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who keeps the tent now?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk:thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs, loads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas, limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take again such preposterous discoveries!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanestthou to curse thus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do I curse thee?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoresonindistinguishable cur, no.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered with such waterflies, diminutives of nature!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Out, gall!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Finch-egg!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle. Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba, A token from her daughter, my fair love, Both taxing me and gaging me to keep An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it: Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay; My major vow lies here, this I'll obey. Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent: This night in banqueting must all be spent. Away, Patroclus!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* With too much blood and too little brain, these two may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too little blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen. Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one that loves quails; but he has not so much brain as earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter there, his brother, the bull,—the primitive statue, and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's leg,— to what form but that he is, should wit larded with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to? To an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to an ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day! spirits and fires!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We go wrong, we go wrong.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, yonder 'tis;There, where we see the lights.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I trouble you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, not a whit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here comes himself to guide you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good night, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,sweet sewer.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good night and welcome, both at once, to thoseThat go or tarry.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good night.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,Keep Hector company an hour or two.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I cannot, lord; I have important business,The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me your hand.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Aside to TROILUS] Follow his torch; he goes toCalchas' tent:I'll keep you company.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet sir, you honour me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And so, good night.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, come, enter my tent.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound: but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, are you up here, ho? speak.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Within] Who calls?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [Within] She comes to you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stand where the torch may not discover us.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cressid comes forth to him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, my charge!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yea, so familiar!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She will sing any man at first sight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;she's noted.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you remember?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Remember! yes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, but do, then;And let your mind be coupled with your words.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What should she remember?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* List.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Roguery!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, then,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll tell you what,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A juggling trick,—to be secretly open.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What did you swear you would bestow on me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good night.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hold, patience!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, Trojan!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Diomed,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy better must.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hark, one word in your ear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O plague and madness!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray you, Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous; The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Behold, I pray you!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, good my lord, go off:You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I pray thee, stay.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You have not patience; come.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's tormentsI will not speak a word!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And so, good night.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, but you part in anger.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Doth that grieve thee?O wither'd truth!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, how now, lord!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By Jove,I will be patient.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Guardian!—why, Greek!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In faith, I do not: come hither once again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?You will break out.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She strokes his cheek!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, come.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word: There is between my will and all offences A guard of patience: stay a little while.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump andpotato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But will you, then?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me some token for the surety of it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll fetch you one.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You have sworn patience.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fear me not, sweet lord;I will not be myself, nor have cognitionOf what I feel: I am all patience.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now the pledge; now, now, now!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O beauty! where is thy faith?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will be patient; outwardly I will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.He loved me—O false wench!—Give't me again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Whose was't?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is no matter, now I have't again.I will not meet with you to-morrow night:I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I shall have it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, that.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge! Thy master now lies thinking in his bed Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove, And gives memorial dainty kisses to it, As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me; He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I had your heart before, this follows it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I did swear patience.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;I'll give you something else.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will have this: whose was it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is no matter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, tell me whose it was.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.But, now you have it, take it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Whose was it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By all Diana's waiting-women yond,And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,It should be challenged.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not;I will not keep my word.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, then, farewell;Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,But it straight starts you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do not like this fooling.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases mebest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, shall I come? the hour?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, come:—O Jove!—do come:—I shall be plagued.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Farewell till then.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good night: I prithee, come.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee But with my heart the other eye doth see. Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find, The error of our eye directs our mind: What error leads must err; O, then conclude Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A proof of strength she could not publish more,Unless she said "My mind is now turn'd whore."
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* All's done, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why stay we, then?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To make a recordation to my soul Of every syllable that here was spoke. But if I tell how these two did co-act, Shall I not lie in publishing a truth? Sith yet there is a credence in my heart, An esperance so obstinately strong, That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears, As if those organs had deceptious functions, Created only to calumniate. Was Cressid here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I cannot conjure, Trojan.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She was not, sure.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most sure she was.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let it not be believed for womanhood! Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme, For depravation, to square the general sex By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nothing at all, unless that this were she.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida: If beauty have a soul, this is not she; If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies, If sanctimony be the gods' delight, If there be rule in unity itself, This is not she. O madness of discourse, That cause sets up with and against itself! Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt Without perdition, and loss assume all reason Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid. Within my soul there doth conduce a fight Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate Divides more wider than the sky and earth, And yet the spacious breadth of this division Admits no orifex for a point as subtle As Ariachne's broken woof to enter. Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates; Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven: Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself; The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed; And with another knot, five-finger-tied, The fractions of her faith, orts of her love, The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* May worthy Troilus be half attach'dWith that which here his passion doth express?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He'll tickle it for his concupy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,And they'll seem glorious.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, contain yourselfYour passion draws ears hither.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu.Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll bring you to the gates.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Accept distracted thanks.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode. Patroclus will give me any thing for the intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab. Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,To stop his ears against admonishment?Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You train me to offend you; get you in:By all the everlasting gods, I'll go!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No more, I say.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where is my brother Hector?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here, sister; arm'd, and bloody in intent. Consort with me in loud and dear petition, Pursue we him on knees; for I have dream'd Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, 'tis true.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ho! bid my trumpet sound!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'dThan spotted livers in the sacrifice.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, be persuaded! do not count it holy To hurt by being just: it is as lawful, For we would give much, to use violent thefts, And rob in the behalf of charity.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;But vows to every purpose must not hold:Unarm, sweet Hector.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hold you still, I say; Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate: Life every man holds dear; but the brave man Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cassandra, call my father to persuade.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth; I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry: Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong, And tempt not yet the brushes of the war. Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy, I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,Which better fits a lion than a man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* When many times the captive Grecian falls,Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,You bid them rise, and live.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O,'tis fair play.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fool's play, by heaven, Hector.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now! how now!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* For the love of all the gods, Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers, And when we have our armours buckled on, The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords, Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fie, savage, fie!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hector, then 'tis wars.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who should withhold me? Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire; Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees, Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears; Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn, Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way, But by my ruin.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast: He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay, Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee, Fall all together.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, Hector, come, go back: Thy wife hath dream'd; thy mother hath had visions; Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt To tell thee that this day is ominous: Therefore, come back.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* AEneas is a-field; And I do stand engaged to many Greeks, Even in the faith of valour, to appear This morning to them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, but thou shalt not go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I must not break my faith. You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir, Let me not shame respect; but give me leave To take that course by your consent and voice, Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Priam, yield not to him!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do not, dear father.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Andromache, I am offended with you:Upon the love you bear me, get you in.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girlMakes all these bodements.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, farewell, dear Hector! Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale! Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents! Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out! How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth! Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement, Like witless antics, one another meet, And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Away! away!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Farewell: yet, soft! Hector! take my leave:Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim: Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight, Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do you hear, my lord? do you hear?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What now?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let me read.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl; and what one thing, what another, that I shall leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell what to think on't. What says she there?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart:The effect doth operate another way.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together.My love with words and errors still she feeds;But edifies another with her deeds.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go look on. That dissembling abominable varlet Diomed, has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see them meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that loves the whore there, might send that Greekish whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand. O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm to-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion. Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,I would swim after.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou dost miscall retire: I do not fly, but advantageous care Withdrew me from the odds of multitude: Have at thee!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hold thy whore, Grecian!—now for thy whore,Trojan!—now the sleeve, now the sleeve!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?Art thou of blood and honour?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:a very filthy rogue.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do believe thee: live.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a plague break thy neck for frightening me! What's become of the wenching rogues? I think they have swallowed one another: I would laugh at that miracle: yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself. I'll seek them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse; Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid: Fellow, commend my service to her beauty; Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan, And am her knight by proof.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I go, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon Hath Doreus prisoner, And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam, Upon the pashed corpses of the kings Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain, Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt, Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed, To reinforcement, or we perish all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles; And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame. There is a thousand Hectors in the field: Now here he fights on Galathe his horse, And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot, And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls Before the belching whale; then is he yonder, And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge, Fall down before him, like the mower's swath: Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes, Dexterity so obeying appetite That what he will he does, and does so much That proof is call'd impossibility.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, courage, courage, princes! great Achilles Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance: Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood, Together with his mangled Myrmidons, That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him, Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it, Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day Mad and fantastic execution, Engaging and redeeming of himself With such a careless force and forceless care As if that luck, in very spite of cunning, Bade him win all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Troilus! thou coward Troilus!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, there, there.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So, so, we draw together.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where is this Hector? Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face; Know what it is to meet Achilles angry: Hector? where's Hector? I will none but Hector.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Troilus, I say! where's Troilus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What wouldst thou?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would correct him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Were I the general, thou shouldst have my officeEre that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O traitor Diomed! turn thy false face, thou traitor,And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha, art thou there?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is my prize; I will not look upon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, both you cogging Greeks; have at you both!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pause, if thou wilt.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan: Be happy that my arms are out of use: My rest and negligence befriends thee now, But thou anon shalt hear of me again; Till when, go seek thy fortune.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fare thee well:I would have been much more a fresher man,Had I expected thee. How now, my brother!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be? No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven, He shall not carry him: I'll be ta'en too, Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say! I reck not though I end my life to-day.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark: No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well; I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all, But I'll be master of it: wilt thou not, beast, abide? Why, then fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come here about me, you my Myrmidons; Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel: Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath: And when I have the bloody Hector found, Empale him with your weapons round about; In fellest manner execute your aims. Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye: It is decreed Hector the great must die.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now, bull! now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my double- henned sparrow! 'loo, Paris, 'loo! The bull has the game: ware horns, ho!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Turn, slave, and fight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What art thou?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A bastard son of Priam's.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a bastard begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard in valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard? Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment: farewell, bastard.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The devil take thee, coward!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most putrefied core, so fair without, Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life. Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath: Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set; How ugly night comes breathing at his heels: Even with the vail and darking of the sun, To close the day up, Hector's life is done.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down! Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone. On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain, 'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth, And, stickler-like, the armies separates. My half-supp'd sword, that frankly would have fed, Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;Along the field I will the Trojan trail.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hark! hark! what shout is that?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Peace, drums!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If it be so, yet bragless let it be;Great Hector was a man as good as he.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* March patiently along: let one be sent To pray Achilles see us at our tent. If in his death the gods have us befriended, Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:Never go home; here starve we out the night.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hector is slain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hector! the gods forbid!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail, In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field. Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed! Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy! I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy, And linger not our sure destructions on!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, you do discomfort all the host!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You understand me not that tell me so: I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death, But dare all imminence that gods and men Address their dangers in. Hector is gone: Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba? Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd, Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead: There is a word will Priam turn to stone; Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives, Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word, Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away: Hector is dead; there is no more to say. Stay yet. You vile abominable tents, Thus proudly pitched upon our Phrygian plains, Let Titan rise as early as he dare, I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward, No space of earth shall sunder our two hates: I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still, That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts. Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go: Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But hear you, hear you!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shamePursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world! world! world! thus is the poor agent despised! O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set a-work, and how ill requited! why should our endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed? what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see: Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing, Till he hath lost his honey and his sting; And being once subdued in armed tail, Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail. Good traders in the flesh, set this in your painted cloths. As many as be here of pander's hall, Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall; Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans, Though not for me, yet for your aching bones. Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade, Some two months hence my will shall here be made: It should be now, but that my fear is this, Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss: Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases, And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If music be the food of love, play on. Give me excess of it that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die. That strain again, it had a dying fall. O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound, That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odor. Enough, no more. 'Tis not so sweet now as it was before. O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou, That, notwithstanding thy capacity Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there, Of what validity and pitch soe'er, But falls into abatement and low price Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you go hunt, my lord?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, Curio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The hart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, so I do, the noblest that I have. Oh, when mine eyes did see Olivia first, Methought she purged the air of pestilence. That instant was I turned into a hart, And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds, E'er since pursue me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now! What news from her?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So please my lord, I might not be admitted, But from her handmaid do return this answer: The element itself, till seven years' heat, Shall not behold her face at ample view, But like a cloistress, she will veiled walk And water once a day her chamber round With eye-offending brine —all this to season A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh And lasting in her sad remembrance.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of love but to a brother, How will she love, when the rich golden shaft Hath killed the flock of all affections else That live in her, when liver, brain, and heart, These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and filled Her sweet perfections with one self king! Away before me to sweet beds of flowers. Love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What country, friends, is this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is Illyria, lady.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And what should I do in Illyria? My brother he is in Elysium. Perchance he is not drown’d.—What think you, sailors?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* True, madam. And, to comfort you with chance, Assure yourself, after our ship did split, When you and those poor number saved with you Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother, Most provident in peril, bind himself, Courage and hope both teaching him the practice, To a strong mast that lived upon the sea, Where, like Arion on the dolphin’s back, I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves So long as I could see.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [giving him money] For saying so, there’s gold. Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope, Whereto thy speech serves for authority, The like of him. Know’st thou this country?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and bornNot three hours' travel from this very place.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who governs here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A noble duke, in natureAs in name.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is his name?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Orsino.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Orsino. I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And so is now, or was so very late. For but a month ago I went from hence, And then ’twas fresh in murmur —as, you know, What great ones do the less will prattle of— That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What’s she?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her In the protection of his son, her brother, Who shortly also died, for whose dear love, They say, she hath abjured the company And sight of men.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That were hard to compass,Because she will admit no kind of suit,No, not the duke’s.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There is a fair behavior in thee, captain, And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character. I prithee—and I’ll pay thee bounteously— Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent . I’ll serve this duke. Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him. It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service. What else may hap to time I will commit. Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be.When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I thank thee. Lead me on.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What a plague means my niece, to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to life.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, let her except, before excepted.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Confine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too. An they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, he.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He’s as tall a man as any’s in Illyria.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What’s that to the purpose?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats. He’sa very fool and a prodigal.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fie, that you’ll say so! He plays o' the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages wordfor word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He hath indeed, almost natural, for besides that he’s afool, he’s a great quarreler, and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarreling, ’tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors thatsay so of him. Who are they?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* With drinking healths to my niece. I’ll drink to her aslong as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' th' toe like aparish top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo , for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet Sir Andrew!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To MARIA] Bless you, fair shrew.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And you too, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What’s that?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My niece’s chambermaid.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My name is Mary, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good Mistress Mary Accost—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You mistake, knight. “Accost” is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.Is that the meaning of “accost”?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fare you well, gentlemen. [she starts to exit]
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, I have not you by the hand.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marry, but you shall have, and here’s my hand. [he offers her his hand]
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [taking his hand] Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wherefore, sweetheart? What’s your metaphor?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It’s dry, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, I think so. I am not such an ass, but I can keep my hand dry. But what’s your jest?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A dry jest, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Are you full of them?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends. Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O knight, thou lackest a cup of canary. When did I see thee so put down?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary putme down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has. But I am a great eaterof beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No question.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride home tomorrow,Sir Toby.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pourquoi, my dear knight?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is “pourquoi”? Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I but followed the arts!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, would that have mended my hair?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But it becomes me well enough, does ’t not?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Excellent. It hangs like flax on a distaff. And I hopeto see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen. Or if she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me. The count himself here hard by woos her.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She’ll none o' the count. She’ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit. I have heard her swear ’t . Tut, there’s life in ’t, man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' th' strangest mind i' th' world. I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters. And yet I will not compare with anold man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Faith, I can cut a caper.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And I can cut the mutton to ’t.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto? My verywalk should be a jig. I would not so much as make waterbut in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star ofa galliard.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dun-colored stock. Shall we set about some revels?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Taurus! That’s sides and heart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see the caper. [SIRANDREW dances] Ha, higher! Ha, ha, excellent!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If the duke continue these favors towards you, Cesario,you are like to be much advanced. He hath known you butthree days, and already you are no stranger.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You either fear his humor or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favors?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, believe me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I thank you. Here comes the count.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who saw Cesario, ho?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* On your attendance, my lord, here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To VIOLA and attendants] Stand you a while aloof. [To VIOLA] Cesario, Thou know’st no less but all. I have unclasped To thee the book even of my secret soul. Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her; Be not denied access, stand at her doors, And tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow Till thou have audience.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sure, my noble lord, If she be so abandoned to her sorrow As it is spoke , she never will admit me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Be clamorous, and leap all civil bounds, Rather than make unprofited return.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, then unfold the passion of my love, Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith: It shall become thee well to act my woes; She will attend it better in thy youth Than in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I think not so, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dear lad, believe it. For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man. Diana’s lip Is not more smooth and rubious. Thy small pipe Is as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound, And all is semblative a woman’s part. I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair. [To CURIO and attendants] Some four or five attend him. All, if you will, for I myself am best When least in company. [To VIOLA] Prosper well in this, And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord, To call his fortunes thine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I’ll do my best To woo your lady— [aside] Yet, a barful strife— Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will notopen my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy absence.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let her hang me. He that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colors.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Make that good.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He shall see none to fear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that sayingwas born, of “I fear no colors.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where, good Mistress Mary?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In the wars. And that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, God give them wisdom that have it. And those thatare fools, let them use their talents.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent. Or tobe turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage, and, for turning away, let summer bear it out.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You are resolute, then?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That if one break, the other will hold. Or, if both break, your gaskins fall.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way. If Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece ofEve’s flesh as any in Illyria.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my lady.Make your excuse wisely, you were best.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [aside] Wit, an ’t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft prove fools. And I, that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? “Better awitty fool, than a foolish wit.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* God bless thee, lady!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Take the fool away.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go to, you’re a dry fool. I’ll no more of you. Besides, you grow dishonest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend. For give the dry fool drink, then is the fool notdry. Bid the dishonest man mend himself. If he mend, heis no longer dishonest. If he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that’s mended is but patched. Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so. If it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty’s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool. Therefore, I say again, take her away.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, I bade them take away you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, Cucullus non facit monachum— that’s as much to say as I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to proveyou a fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Can you do it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dexterously, good madonna.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Make your proof.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I must catechise you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll bide your proof.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good madonna, why mournest thou?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good fool, for my brother’s death.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What think you of this fool, Malvolio? Doth he not mend?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for two pence thatyou are no fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How say you to that, Malvolio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal. I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard already. Unless you laughand minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest Itake these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools' zanies.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste witha distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail. Nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speakest well of fools!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* From the Count Orsino, is it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know not, madam. 'Tis a fair young man, and well attended.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who of my people hold him in delay?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fetch him off, I pray you. He speaks nothing but madman.Fie on him!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go you, Malvolio. If it be a suit from the count, I am sick, or not at home. What you will, to dismiss it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool, whose skull Jove cram with brains, for—here he comes—one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By mine honor, half-drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A gentleman.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A gentleman? What gentleman?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis a gentleman here— a plague o' these pickle herring! How now, sot!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good Sir Toby!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lechery! I defy lechery. There’s one at the gate.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, marry, what is he?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not. Give me faith, say I. Well, it’s all one.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What’s a drunken man like, fool?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Like a drowned man, a fool and a madman. One draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my coz. For he’s in the third degree of drink, he’s drowned. Go look after him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is but mad yet, madonna, and the fool shall look to the madman.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you.I told him you were sick. He takes on him to understandso much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep. He seems to have a foreknowledge ofthat too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? He’s fortified against any denial.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tell him he shall not speak with me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He's been told so, and he says he’ll stand at your door like a sheriff’s post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he’ll speak with you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What kind o' man is he?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, of mankind.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What manner of man?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Of very ill manner. He’ll speak with you, will you or no.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Of what personage and years is he?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy, as a squash is before ’tis a peascod, or a codling when ’tis almost an apple. 'Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favored, andhe speaks very shrewishly. One would think his mother’smilk were scarce out of him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me my veil. Come, throw it o'er my face. [OLIVIA puts on a veil] We’ll once more hear Orsino’s embassy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The honorable lady of the house, which is she?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Speak to me. I shall answer for her. Your will?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty—I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast away my speech, for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn. I am very comptible, even to the leastsinister usage.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Whence came you, sir?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that Imay proceed in my speech.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Are you a comedian?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, my profound heart. And yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I do not usurp myself, I am.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. Butthis is from my commission. I will on with my speech inyour praise and then show you the heart of my message.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come to what is important in ’t. I forgive you the praise.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, I took great pains to study it, and ’tis poetical.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It is the more like to be feigned. I pray you, keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone. If you have reason, be brief. 'Tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tell me your mind.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am a messenger.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when thecourtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war,no taxation of homage. I hold the olive in my hand . My words are as full of peace as matter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my entertainment. What I am and what I would are assecret as maidenhead. To your ears, divinity. To any other’s, profanation.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give us the place alone. We will hear this divinity.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, sir, what is your text?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most sweet lady—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your text?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In Orsino’s bosom.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, I have read it. It is heresy. Have you no more to say?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good madam, let me see your face.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You are now out of your text. But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Is ’t not well done?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Excellently done, if God did all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis in grain, sir. 'Twill endure wind and weather.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white Nature’s own sweet and cunning hand laid on. Lady, you are the cruel’st she alive If you will lead these graces to the grave And leave the world no copy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted. I will give out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labeled to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I see you what you are, you are too proud. But, if you were the devil, you are fair. My lord and master loves you. Oh, such love Could be but recompensed though you were crowned The nonpareil of beauty.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How does he love me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* With adorations, fertile tears, With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Your lord does know my mind. I cannot love him. Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth. In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him; He might have took his answer long ago.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I did love you in my master’s flame, With such a suffering, such a deadly life, In your denial I would find no sense; I would not understand it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, what would you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house. Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night. Halloo your name to the reverberate hills And make the babbling gossip of the air Cry out “Olivia!” Oh, you should not rest Between the elements of air and earth, But you should pity me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You might do much.What is your parentage?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.I am a gentleman.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Get you to your lord. I cannot love him. Let him send no more— Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well. I thank you for your pains. Spend this for me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am no fee’d post, lady. Keep your purse. My master, not myself, lacks recompense. Love make his heart of flint that you shall love, And let your fervor, like my master’s, be Placed in contempt. Farewell, fair cruelty.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “What is your parentage?” “Above my fortunes, yet my state is well. I am a gentleman.” I’ll be sworn thou art; Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit, Do give thee fivefold blazon. Not too fast! Soft, soft! Unless the master were the man. How now? Even so quickly may one catch the plague? Methinks I feel this youth’s perfections With an invisible and subtle stealth To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.— What ho, Malvolio!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here, madam, at your service.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Run after that same peevish messenger, The county’s man. He left this ring behind him, Would I or not. Tell him I’ll none of it. [OLIVIA hands him a ring] Desire him not to flatter with his lord, Nor hold him up with hopes. I am not for him. If that the youth will come this way tomorrow, I’ll give him reasons for ’t. Hie thee, Malvolio.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, I will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind. Fate, show thy force. Ourselves we do not owe. What is decreed must be, and be this so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you stay no longer, nor will you not that I go with you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me. The malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours. Therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, sooth, sir. My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touchof modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir, altered that, for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas the day!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful. But though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yetthus far I will boldly publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you will not undo what you have done—that is, kill him whom you have recovered—desire it not. Fare you wellat once. My bosom is full of kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino’s court. Farewell.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The gentleness of all the gods go with thee! I have many enemies in Orsino’s court, Else would I very shortly see thee there. But, come what may, I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Even now, sir. On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She returns this ring to you, sir. You might have savedme my pains to have taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperateassurance she will none of him. And one thing more, that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs,unless it be to report your lord’s taking of this. Receive it so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She took the ring of me. I’ll none of it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and her will is it should be so returned. [he throws down the ring] If it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye. If not, be it his that finds it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I left no ring with her. What means this lady? Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her! She made good view of me, indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly. She loves me, sure! The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger. None of my lord’s ring? Why, he sent her none. I am the man. If it be so, as ’tis, Poor lady, she were better love a dream. Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness, Wherein the pregnant enemy does much. How easy is it for the proper false In women’s waxen hearts to set their forms! Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we, For such as we are made of, such we be. How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly, And I, poor monster, fond as much on him, And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me. What will become of this? As I am man, My state is desperate for my master’s love. As I am woman, now, alas the day, What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe! O time, thou must untangle this, not I. It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Approach, Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes, and diluculo surgere, thou know’st,—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, my troth, I know not. But I know to be up late is to be up late.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A false conclusion. I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early, sothat to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the four elements?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou'rt a scholar. Let us therefore eat and drink. Marian,I say! A stoup of wine!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here comes the fool, i' faith.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, my hearts! Did you never see the picture of “WeThree”?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Welcome, ass. Now let’s have a catch.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has.— [To th e FOOL ] In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus. 'Twas very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman. Hadst it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I did impeticos thy gratillity, for Malvolio’s nose is no whipstock. My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling when all is done.Now, a song.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [giving money to th e FOOL ] Come on. There is sixpence for you. Let’s have a song.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [giving money to the FOOL ] There’s a testril of me too. If one knight give a—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would you have a love song or a song of good life?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A love song, a love song.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, ay. I care not for good life.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [sings] O mistress mine, where are you roaming? O, stay and hear! Your true love’s coming, That can sing both high and low: Trip no further, pretty sweeting. Journeys end in lovers meeting, Every wise man’s son doth know.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Excellent good, i' faith.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good, good.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [sings] What is love? 'Tis not hereafter. Present mirth hath present laughter. What’s to come is still unsure. In delay there lies no plenty. Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty. Youth’s a stuff will not endure.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A contagious breath.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An you love me, let’s do ’t. I am dog at a catch.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By 'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most certain. Let our catch be “Thou Knave.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “Hold thy peace, thou knave,” knight? I shall be constrained in ’t to call thee knave, knight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me“knave.” Begin, Fool. It begins “Hold thy peace.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good, i' faith. Come, begin.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lady’s a Cataian. We are politicians, Malvolio’s a Peg- a-Ramsey, and (sings) Three merry men be we. —Am notI consanguineous? Am I not of her blood? Tillyvally! “Lady”! ( sings) There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Beshrew me, the knight’s in admirable fooling.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I too.He does it with a better grace, but I do it more natural.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (sings) O' the twelfth day of December—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* For the love o' God, peace!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My masters, are you mad? Or what are you? Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do you make an alehouse of my lady’shouse, that you squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you, that, though she harbors you as her kinsman, she’s nothing allied to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you are welcometo the house. If not, an it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (sings) Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, good Sir Toby.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( sings ) His eyes do show his days are almost done.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is ’t even so?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( sings ) But I will never die.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( sings ) Sir Toby, there you lie.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is much credit to you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (sings) Shall I bid him go?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (sings) What an if you do?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (sings) Shall I bid him go, and spare not?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (sings) O no, no, no, no, you dare not.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Out o' tune, sir. You lie. Art any more than a steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shallbe no more cakes and ale?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady’s favor at anything more than contempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule. She shall know of it, by this hand.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go shake your ears!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a-hungry, to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do ’t, knight. I’ll write thee a challenge. Or I’ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the youthof the count’s was today with thy lady, she is much outof quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him.If I do not gull him into a nayword and make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to liestraight in my bed. I know I can do it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Possess us, possess us, tell us something of him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, if I thought that, I’d beat him like a dog!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, for being a puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear knight?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have no exquisite reason for ’t, but I have reason good enough.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The devil a puritan that he is, or anything constantly,but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him. And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What wilt thou do?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love, wherein by the color of his beard, the shape of his leg,the manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated. I can write very like my lady yourniece: on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Excellent! I smell a device.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have ’t in my nose too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she’s in love with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that color.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And your horse now would make him an ass.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ass, I doubt not.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, ’twill be admirable!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter. Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and dream onthe event. Farewell.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good night, Penthesilea.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Before me, she’s a good wench.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She’s a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me. Whato' that?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I was adored once too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let’s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Send for money, knight. If thou hast her not i' the end, call me “Cut.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, come, I’ll go burn some sack. 'Tis too late to goto bed now. Come, knight. Come, knight.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me some music. ( music plays ) Now, good morrow, friends.— Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song, That old and antique song we heard last night. Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times: Come, but one verse.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who was it?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Feste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the lady Olivia’s father took much delight in. He is about the house.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( t o VIOLA ) Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love, In the sweet pangs of it remember me; For such as I am, all true lovers are, Unstaid and skittish in all motions else Save in the constant image of the creature That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It gives a very echo to the seatWhere Love is throned.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou dost speak masterly. My life upon ’t, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stay’d upon some favor that it loves. Hath it not, boy?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A little, by your favor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What kind of woman is’t?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Of your complexion.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* About your years, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Too old by heaven. Let still the woman take An elder than herself. So wears she to him, So sways she level in her husband’s heart. For, boy, however we do praise ourselves, Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn, Than women’s are.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I think it well, my lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent. For women are as roses, whose fair flowerBeing once displayed, doth fall that very hour.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And so they are. Alas, that they are so, To die even when they to perfection grow!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.— Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain; The spinsters and the knitters in the sun And the free maids that weave their thread with bones Do use to chant it . It is silly sooth, And dallies with the innocence of love, Like the old age.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Are you ready, sir?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay; prithee, sing.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [sings] Come away, come away, death, And in sad cypress let me be laid. Fly away, fly away breath, I am slain by a fair cruel maid. My shroud of white, stuck all with yew, O, prepare it! My part of death, no one so true Did share it. Not a flower, not a flower sweet On my black coffin let there be strown. Not a friend, not a friend greet My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown. A thousand thousand sighs to save, Lay me, O, where Sad true lover never find my grave, To weep there!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [giving money] There’s for thy pains.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No pains, sir. I take pleasure in singing, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I’ll pay thy pleasure then.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me now leave to leave thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be everything and their intent everywhere, for that’s it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let all the rest give place.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Once more, Cesario, Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty. Tell her my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her, Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune; But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But if she cannot love you, sir?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I cannot be so answer’d.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sooth, but you must. Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her. You tell her so. Must she not then be answered?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There is no woman’s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart. No woman’s heart So big, to hold so much. They lack retention. Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much. Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, but I know—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What dost thou know?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Too well what love women to men may owe. In faith, they are as true of heart as we. My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And what’s her history?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A blank, my lord. She never told her love, But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud, Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought, And with a green and yellow melancholy She sat like patience on a monument, Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed? We men may say more, swear more, but indeed Our shows are more than will, for still we prove Much in our vows, but little in our love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am all the daughters of my father’s house, And all the brothers too—and yet I know not. Sir, shall I to this lady?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, that’s the theme.To her in haste. Give her this jewel. SayMy love can give no place, bide no denay. [he hands her a jewel]
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, I’ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascallysheep-biter come by some notable shame?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would exult, man. You know, he brought me out o' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To anger him, we’ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue. Shall we not, Sir Andrew?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here comes the little villain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, my metal of India?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Get you all three into the boxtree. Malvolio’s coming down this walk. He has been yonder i' the sun practisingbehavior to his own shadow this half hour. Observe him,for the love of mockery, for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name ofjesting!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lie thou there (throwing down a letter), for here comesthe trout that must be caught with tickling.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me, and I have heard herself come thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her. What should Ithink on ’t?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Here’s an overweening rogue!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [aside] O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him. How he jets under his advanced plumes!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) 'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Peace, I say.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To be Count Malvolio!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Ah, rogue!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Pistol him, pistol him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Peace, peace!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There is example for ’t. The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Fie on him, Jezebel!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [aside] O, peace! Now he’s deeply in. Look how imagination blows him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Having been three months married to her, sitting in my state—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Oh, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown, having come from a daybed, where I have left Olivia sleeping—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Fire and brimstone!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) O, peace, peace!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And then to have the humor of state, and after a demuretravel of regard, telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs, to ask for my kinsman Toby—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Bolts and shackles!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) O peace, peace, peace! Now, now.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown the while, and perchance wind up watch,or play with my—some rich jewel. Toby approaches, curtsies there to me—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Shall this fellow live?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [aside] Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Saying, “Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech—”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) What, what?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “You must amend your drunkenness.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Out, scab!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight—”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) That’s me, I warrant you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “One Sir Andrew—”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) I knew ’twas I, for many do call me fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( seeing the letter ) What employment have we here?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Now is the woodcock near the gin.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [aside] O, peace! And the spirit of humors intimate reading aloud to him!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [picking up the letter] By my life, this is my lady’s hand these be her very C’s, her U’s and her T’s and thusmakes she her great P’s. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Her C’s, her U’s and her T’s. Why that?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [reads] “To the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes”—Her very phrases! By your leave, wax. Soft! And the impressure her Lucrece, with which she uses to seal.'Tis my lady. To whom should this be?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) This wins him, liver and all.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [reads] “Jove knows I love,But who?Lips, do not move; No man must know.”“No man must know.” What follows? The numbers altered. “No man must know.” If this should be thee, Malvolio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Marry, hang thee, brock!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [reads] “I may command where I adore, But silence, like a Lucrece knife,With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore;M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) A fustian riddle!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Excellent wench, say I.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.” Nay, but first, let me see, let me see, let me see.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) What dish o' poison has she dressed him!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) And with what wing the staniel checks at it!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “I may command where I adore.” Why, she may command me.I serve her, she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capacity. There is no obstruction in this. And the end—what should that alphabetical position portend? If I could make that resemble something in me—Softly! M.O.A.I.—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) O, ay, make up that.—He is now at a cold scent.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [aside] Sowter will cry upon ’t for all this, though it be as rank as a fox.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “M”—Malvolio. “M”—why, that begins my name.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [aside] Did not I say he would work it out? The cur is excellent at faults.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “M.” But then there is no consonancy in the sequel. That suffers under probation. “A” should follow but “O” does.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) And “O” shall end, I hope.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Ay, or I’ll cudgel him and make him cry “O!”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And then “I” comes behind.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [aside] Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “M.O.A.I.” This simulation is not as the former, and yet to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my name. Soft, here follows prose. [reads] “If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open their hands. Let thy blood and spirit embrace them. And, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang arguments of state. Put thyself into the trick of singularity. She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered. I say, remember. Go to, thou art made, if thou desir’st to be so; if not, let me see theea steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthyto touch Fortune’s fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with thee, The Fortunate Unhappy” Daylight and champaign discovers not more. This is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point- devise the very man. I donot now fool myself, to let imagination jade me, for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. Shedid commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praisemy leg being cross-gartered, and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yeta postscript. [reads] “Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling. Thy smiles become thee well. Therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.” Jove, I thank thee! I will smile. I will do everything that thou wilt have me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I could marry this wench for this device.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So could I too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nor I neither.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Or o' mine either?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy bondslave?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I' faith, or I either?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Like aqua vitae with a midwife.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my lady. He will come to her in yellow stockings, and ’tis a color she abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests. And he will smileupon her, which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a melancholy as she i s, that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I’ll make one too.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by thytabour?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, sir, I live by the church.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Art thou a churchman?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No such matter, sir. I do live by the church; for I dolive at my house, and my house doth stand by the church.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggardwell near him, or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is buta cheveril glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, that’s certain. They that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would therefore my sister had no name, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, man?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, sir, her name’s a word, and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But, indeed, words arevery rascals since bonds disgraced them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy reason, man?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not so, sir, I do care for something. But in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you. If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Art not thou the Lady Olivia’s fool?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly. She willkeep no fool, sir, till she be married, and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings; the husband’s the bigger: I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun. It shines everywhere. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress: Ithink I saw your wisdom there.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, an thou pass upon me, I’ll no more with thee. Hold, there’s expenses for thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By my troth, I’ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one, (aside] though I would not have it grow on my chin. [To fool] Is thy lady within?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yes, being kept together and put to use.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring aCressida to this Troilus.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [giving him money] I understand you, sir. 'Tis well begged.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar. Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. Iwill construe to them whence you come. Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin, I might say “element,” but the word is overworn.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This fellow is wise enough to play the fool, And to do that well craves a kind of wit. He must observe their mood on whom he jests, The quality of persons, and the time, And, like the haggard, check at every feather That comes before his eye. This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man’s art, For folly that he wisely shows is fit. But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Save you, gentleman.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And you, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Et vous aussi. Votre serviteur!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you encounter the house? My niece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am bound to your niece, sir. I mean, she is the list of my voyage.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Taste your legs, sir. Put them to motion.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My legs do better understand me, sir, than I understandwhat you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we are prevented.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odors on you!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) That youth’s a rare courtier. “Rain odors.” Well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [aside] “Odors,” “pregnant,” and “vouchsafed.” I’ll get'em all three all ready.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me your hand, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My duty, madam, and most humble service.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is your name?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cesario is your servant’s name, fair princess.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call’d compliment. You’re servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* For him, I think not on him. For his thoughts,Would they were blanks, rather than fill’d with me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughtsOn his behalf.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, by your leave, I pray you, I bade you never speak again of him. But, would you undertake another suit, I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Dear lady—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me leave, beseech you. I did send, After the last enchantment you did here, A ring in chase of you. So did I abuse Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you: Under your hard construction must I sit, To force that on you, in a shameful cunning Which you knew none of yours. What might you think? Have you not set mine honor at the stake, And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving Enough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom, Hides my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I pity you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That’s a degree to love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, not a grize. For ’tis a vulgar proofThat very oft we pity enemies.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why then methinks ’tis time to smile again. O world, how apt the poor are to be proud! If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The clock upbraids me with the waste of time. Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you. And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest, Your wife is like to reap a proper man. There lies your way, due west.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then westward ho!Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship!You’ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Stay, I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That you do think you are not what you are.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If I think so, I think the same of you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then think you right: I am not what I am.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would you were as I would have you be!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would it be better, madam, than I am? I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (aside] Oh, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful In the contempt and anger of his lip! A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon Than love that would seem hid. Love’s night is noon. [To VIOLA] Cesario, by the roses of the spring, By maidhood, honor, truth, and everything, I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride, Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide. Do not extort thy reasons from this clause, For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause, But rather reason thus with reason fetter. Love sought is good, but given unsought better.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By innocence I swear, and by my youth I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth, And that no woman has, nor never none Shall mistress be of it, save I alone. And so adieu, good madam. Nevermore Will I my master’s tears to you deplore.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the Count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon me. I saw’t i'theorchard.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As plain as I see you now.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked. The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north of my lady’s opinion, where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valor or policy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An ’t be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor. Challenge me the count’s youth to fight with him. Hurt him in eleven places. My niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go, write it in a martial hand. Be curst and brief. Itis no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of ink. If thou “thou”-est him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, althoughthe sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set 'em down. Go, about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where shall I find you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We’ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong,or so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* We shall have a rare letter from him: but you’ll not deliver ’t?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Never trust me, then. And by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of the anatomy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Look where the youngest wren of nine comes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado. For there is no Christian thatmeans to be saved by believing rightly can ever believesuch impossible passages of grossness. He’s in yellow stockings.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And cross-gartered?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most villanously, like a pedant that keeps a school i' the church. I have dogged him, like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a thing as ’tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he’ll smile and take ’t for a great favor.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I would not by my will have troubled you,But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,I will no further chide you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I could not stay behind you. My desire, More sharp than filèd steel, did spur me forth. And not all love to see you, though so much As might have drawn one to a longer voyage, But jealousy what might befall your travel, Being skilless in these parts, which to a stranger, Unguided and unfriended, often prove Rough and unhospitable. My willing love, The rather by these arguments of fear, Set forth in your pursuit.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks, And thanks, and ever thanks. And oft good turns Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay. But were my worth as is my conscience, firm, You should find better dealing. What’s to do? Shall we go see the relics of this town?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Tomorrow, sir. Best first go see your lodging.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am not weary, and ’tis long to night: I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes With the memorials and the things of fame That do renown this city.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Would you’d pardon me; I do not without danger walk these streets: Once in a sea-fight 'gainst the Count his galleys I did some service, of such note indeed, That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answered.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Belike you slew great number of his people?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The offence is not of such a bloody nature; Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument. It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them, which, for traffic’s sake, Most of our city did. Only myself stood out; For which, if I be lapsèd in this place, I shall pay dear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do not then walk too open.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here’s my purse. [giving him money] In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet, Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town. There shall you have me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why I your purse?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase, and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I’ll be your purse-bearer and leave youFor an hour.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To the Elephant.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do remember.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have sent after him. He says he’ll come. How shall I feast him? What bestow of him? For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow’d. I speak too loud. (to MARIA) Where’s Malvolio? He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes. Where is Malvolio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He’s coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He is sure possessed, madam.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, what’s the matter? Does he rave?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, madam, he does nothing but smile. Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go call him hither.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, Malvolio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sweet lady, ho, ho.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Smilest thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sad, lady! I could be sad. This does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering, but whatof that? If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is, “Please one, and please all.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To bed? “Ay, sweetheart, and I’ll come to thee.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thyhand so oft?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How do you, Malvolio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* At your request! Yes, nightingales answer daws!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “Be not afraid of greatness.” 'Twas well writ.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “Some are born great—”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ha?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “Some achieve greatness—”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What sayest thou?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “And some have greatness thrust upon them.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Heaven restore thee!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “Remember who commended thy yellow stockings—”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thy yellow stockings?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “And wished to see thee cross-gartered.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Cross-gartered?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so—”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Am I made?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* “If not, let me see thee a servant still.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, this is very midsummer madness.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned. I could hardly entreat him back. He attends your ladyship’s pleasure.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I’ll come to him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where’s my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him. I would not have him miscarry for the half of mydowry.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, ho! Do you come near me now? No worse man than SirToby to look to me. This concurs directly with the letter. She sends him on purpose that I may appear stubborn to him, for she incites me to that in the letter. “Cast thy humble slough,” says she. “Be oppositewith a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang with arguments of state. Put thyself into the trickof singularity,” and consequently sets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue,in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her, but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, “Let this fellow be looked to.” “Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” nor after my degree, but “fellow.” Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance—what canbe said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is thedoer of this, and he is to be thanked.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him, yet I’ll speak to him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here he is, here he is. How is’t with you, sir? How is’t with you, man?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my private. Go off.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [t o SIR TOBY BELCH ] Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! Did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Aha! Does she so?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [t o FABIAN and MARIA ] Go to, go to! Peace, peace. We must deal gently with him. Let me alone. —How do you, Malvolio? How is ’t with you? What, man, defy the devil!Consider, he’s an enemy to mankind.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do you know what you say?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [t o SIR TOBY BELCH ] La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Carry his water to the wisewoman.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, mistress?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O Lord!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [t o MARIA ] Prithee, hold thy peace. This is not the way. Do you not see you move him? Let me alone with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No way but gentleness, gently, gently. The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [t o MALVOLIO ] Why, how now, my bawcock! How dost thou, chuck?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, Biddy, come with me. —What, man! 'Tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan. Hang him, foulcollier!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My prayers, minx?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To SIR TOBY BELCH] No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go, hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow things. I am not of your element. You shall know more hereafter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is ’t possible?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* His very genius hath taken the infection of the device,man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The house will be the quieter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound. My nieceis already in the belief that he’s mad. We may carry itthus, for our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to have mercy onhim, at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* More matter for a May morning.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [presenting a paper] Here’s the challenge, read it. Warrant there’s vinegar and pepper in ’t.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is ’t so saucy?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, is ’t, I warrant him. Do but read.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me. [reads] “Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good, and valiant.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [reads] “Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for ’t.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (reads) “Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly. But thou liest in thy throat. That is not the matter I challenge thee for.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Very brief, and to exceeding good sense—less.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [reads] “I will waylay thee going home, where if it be thy chance to kill me—”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [reads] “Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Still you keep o' the windy side of the law. Good.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [reads] “Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of our souls. He may have mercy upon mine, but my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy, Andrew Aguecheek” If this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I’ll give’t him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You may have very fit occasion for ’t. He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum-baily. So soon as ever thou seest him, draw, and as thou drawest, swear horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him. Away!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, let me alone for swearing.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behavior of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacityand breeding. His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I willdeliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that theywill kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here he comes with your niece. Give them way till he take leave, and presently after him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I have said too much unto a heart of stone And laid mine honor too unchary on ’t. There’s something in me that reproves my fault, But such a headstrong potent fault it is That it but mocks reproof.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* With the same 'havior that your passion bearsGoes on my master’s grief.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here, wear this jewel for me. 'Tis my picture. Refuse it not. It hath no tongue to vex you. And I beseech you come again tomorrow. What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny, That honor, saved, may upon asking give?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nothing but this: your true love for my master.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How with mine honor may I give him thatWhich I have given to you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will acquit you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well.A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Gentleman, God save thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And you, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That defense thou hast, betake thee to ’t . Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skillful and deadly.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You mistake, sir. I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and clear from any imageof offense done to any man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I pray you, sir, what is he?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word. “Give ’t or take ’t.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valor. Belike this is a man of that quirk.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury. Therefore get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him. Therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you must, that’s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offense to him is. It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal arbitrament, but nothing of the circumstance more.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valor. He is, indeed, sir, the most skillful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found inany part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I shall be much bound to you for ’t. I am one that hadrather go with sir priest than sir knight. I care not who knows so much of my mettle.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, man, he’s a very devil. I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such a mortal motion, that it is inevitable. And on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they stepon. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pox on ’t! I’ll not meddle with him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, but he will not now be pacified. Fabian can scarcehold him yonder.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Plague on ’t, an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen him damned ere I’d have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, gray Capilet.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I’ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on ’t. This shall end without the perdition of souls. [aside] Marry, I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To FABIAN ] I have his horse to take up the quarrel. Ihave persuaded him the youth’s a devil.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and lookspale, as if a bear were at his heels.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (t o VIOLA ) There’s no remedy, sir; he will fight with you for ’s oath sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for the supportance ofhis vow. He protests he will not hurt you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give ground, if you see him furious.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy. The gentleman will, for his honor’s sake, have one bout with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it. But he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on, to ’t.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pray God, he keep his oath!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I do assure you, ’tis against my will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Put up your sword. If this young gentleman Have done offence, I take the fault on me. If you offend him, I for him defy you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You, sir? Why, what are you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* One, sir, that for his love dares yet do moreThan you have heard him brag to you he will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [t o ANTONIO ] I’ll be with you anon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [t o ANDREW ] Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marry, will I, sir. And for that I promised you, I’ll be as good as my word. He will bear you easily and reinswell.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is the man. Do thy office.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You do mistake me, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, sir, no jot. I know your favor well,Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.—Take him away. He knows I know him well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I must obey. (t o VIOLA ) This comes with seeking you: But there’s no remedy. I shall answer it . What will you do, now my necessity Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me Much more for what I cannot do for you Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed, But be of comfort.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, sir, away.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [t o VIOLA ] I must entreat of you some of that money.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What money, sir? For the fair kindness you have showed me here, And part being prompted by your present trouble, Out of my lean and low ability I’ll lend you something. My having is not much. I’ll make division of my present with you. Hold, there’s half my coffer. (offering him money)
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you deny me now? Is ’t possible that my deserts to you Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery, Lest that it make me so unsound a man As to upbraid you with those kindnesses That I have done for you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know of none, Nor know I you by voice or any feature. I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O heavens themselves!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, sir, I pray you, go.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here I snatched one half out of the jaws of death, Relieved him with such sanctity of love, And to his image, which methought did promise Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What’s that to us? The time goes by. Away!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But oh, how vile an idol proves this god! Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame. In nature there’s no blemish but the mind. None can be called deformed but the unkind. Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The man grows mad. Away with him. Come, come, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Lead me on.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Methinks his words do from such passion fly, That he believes himself. So do not I. Prove true, imagination, oh, prove true, That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come hither, knight. Come hither, Fabian. We’ll whispero'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He named Sebastian. I my brother know Yet living in my glass. Even such and so In favor was my brother, and he went Still in this fashion, color, ornament, For him I imitate. Oh, if it prove, Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him. And for his cowardship, ask Fabian.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* An I do not—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, let’s see the event.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow. Let me be clear of thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well held out, i' faith. No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario, nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else. Thou know’st not me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Vent my folly? He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art coming?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me. There’s money for thee. [giving money] If you tarry longer, I shall give worse payment.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report—afterfourteen years' purchase.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To SEBASTIAN] Now, sir, have I met you again? There’s for you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [returning the blow] Why, there’s for thee, and there, and there. Are all the people mad?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o'er the house.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [aside] This will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in some of your coats for two pence.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( seizi ng SEBASTIAN) Come on, sir, hold!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, let him alone. I’ll go another way to work with him. I’ll have an action of battery against him if therebe any law in Illyria. Though I struck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To SIR TOBY BELCH] Let go thy hand.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your iron. You are well fleshed. Come on.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will be free from thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What wouldst thou now? If thou darest tempt me further,draw thy sword.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hold, Toby! On thy life I charge thee, hold!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch, Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves, Where manners ne'er were preach’d! Out of my sight!— Be not offended, dear Cesario.— Rudesby, be gone!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I prithee, gentle friend, Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway In this uncivil and unjust extent Against thy peace. Go with me to my house, And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks This ruffian hath botched up, that thou thereby Mayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go. Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me! He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) What relish is in this? How runs the stream? Or I am mad, or else this is a dream. Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep. If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, come, I prithee. Would thou’dst be ruled by me!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, I will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, say so, and so be!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard. Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate. Do it quickly. I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, I’ll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in ’t, and I would I were the first that ever dissembled insuch a gown.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am not tall enough to become the function well, nor lean enough to be thought a good student, but to be saidan honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Jove bless thee, master Parson.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Bonos dies, Sir Toby. For, as the old hermit of Prague,that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, “That that is is.” So I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson. For, what is “that” but“that,” and “is” but “is”?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To him, Sir Topas.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( disguising his voice ) What ho, I say! Peace in this prison!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The knave counterfeits well. A good knave.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( from within ) Who calls there?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Out, hyperbolical fiend! How vexest thou this man! Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* ( aside ) Well said, Master Parson.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas,do not think I am mad. They have laid me here in hideous darkness.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Sayest thou that house is dark?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* As hell, Sir Topas.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony. And yet complainest thou of obstruction?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this house is dark.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madman, thou errest. I say, there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as hell. And I say, there was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you are. Make the trial of it in any constant question.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What thinkest thou of his opinion?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness. Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow ofthy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My most exquisite Sir Topas!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, I am for all waters.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown.He sees thee not.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou findest him. I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [sings in his own voice] Hey, Robin, jolly Robin, Tell me how thy lady does.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fool!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (sings) My lady is unkind, perdy.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fool!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (sings) Alas, why is she so?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fool, I say!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (sings) She loves another—Who calls, ha?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for ’t.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Master Malvolio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, good fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I am as well in my wits, Fool, as thou art.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But as well? Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* They have here propertied me, keep me in darkness, sendministers to me —asses!—and do all they can to face me out of my wits.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Advise you what you say. The minister is here. [in the voice of Sir Topas] Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore! Endeavor thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble-babble.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sir Topas!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [as Sir Topas] Maintain no words with him, good fellow. [in his own voice] Who, I, sir? Not I, sir. God b' wi' you, good Sir Topas. [as Sir Topas] Marry, amen. [in hisown voice] I will, sir, I will.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fool, fool, fool, I say!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am shent forspeaking to you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good fool, help me to some light and some paper. I tellthee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well-a-day that you were, sir.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey what I will set down to my lady. It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I will help you to ’t. But tell me true, are you not mad indeed? Or do you but counterfeit?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Believe me, I am not. I tell thee true.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Nay, I’ll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.I will fetch you light, and paper, and ink.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree. I prithee,be gone.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [sings] I am gone, sir, And anon, sir, I’ll be with you again, In a trice, Like to the old Vice, Your need to sustain, Who, with dagger of lath In his rage and his wrath, Cries “Aha,” to the devil, Like a mad lad, “Pare thy nails, dad, Adieu, goodman devil.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is the air, that is the glorious sun. This pearl she gave me, I do feel ’t and see ’t, And though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus, Yet ’tis not madness. Where’s Antonio, then? I could not find him at the Elephant. Yet there he was, and there I found this credit, That he did range the town to seek me out. His counsel now might do me golden service. For though my soul disputes well with my sense That this may be some error, but no madness, Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune So far exceed all instance, all discourse, That I am ready to distrust mine eyes And wrangle with my reason that persuades me To any other trust but that I am mad— Or else the lady’s mad. Yet if ’twere so, She could not sway her house, command her followers, Take and give back affairs and their dispatch With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing As I perceive she does. There’s something in ’t That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [t o SEBASTIAN ] Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well, Now go with me and with this holy man Into the chantry by. There, before him And underneath that consecrated roof, Plight me the full assurance of your faith, That my most jealous and too doubtful soul May live at peace. He shall conceal it Whiles you are willing it shall come to note, What time we will our celebration keep According to my birth. What do you say?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I’ll follow this good man, and go with you;And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Anything.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Do not desire to see this letter.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This is, to give a dog and in recompense desire my dogagain.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Just the contrary. The better for thy friends.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, sir, the worse.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How can that be?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me, now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass. So that by my foes,sir I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends, I am abused. So that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, this is excellent.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* By my troth, sir, no—though it please you to be one of my friends.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [giving a coin] Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there’s gold.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, you give me ill counsel.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a double-dealer.There’s another. ( giving a coin )
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play, and the old saying is, the third pays for all. The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* You can fool no more money out of me at this throw. If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her,and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness. But, as yousay, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will awake it anon.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That face of his I do remember well. Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war. A baubling vessel was he captain of, For shallow draught and bulk unprizable, With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet, That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him. —What’s the matter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Orsino, this is that Antonio That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy, And this is he that did the Tiger board When your young nephew Titus lost his leg. Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state, In private brabble did we apprehend him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side, But in conclusion put strange speech upon me. I know not what ’twas but distraction.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Notable pirate! Thou saltwater thief, What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies, Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear, Hast made thine enemies?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Orsino, noble sir, Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me. Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though, I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino’s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither. That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem. A wreck past hope he was. His life I gave him and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication. For his sake Did I expose myself, pure for his love, Into the danger of this adverse town, Drew to defend him when he was beset, Where being apprehended, his false cunning, (Not meaning to partake with me in danger) Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance, And grew a twenty-years-removed thing While one would wink, denied me mine own purse, Which I had recommended to his use Not half an hour before.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How can this be?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To ANTONIO] When came he to this town?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Today, my lord, and for three months before, No interim, not a minute’s vacancy,Both day and night did we keep company.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here comes the Countess. Now heaven walks on earth. But for thee, fellow. Fellow, thy words are madness: Three months this youth hath tended upon me; But more of that anon. [To an officer] Take him aside.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable? Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Gracious Olivia—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What do you say, Cesario?—Good my lord—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord would speak. My duty hushes me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Still so cruel?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Still so constant, lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What, to perverseness? You, uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull’st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered —what shall I do?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Even what it please my lord that shall become him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, Kill what I love? —A savage jealousy That sometimes savors nobly. But hear me this: Since you to nonregardance cast my faith, And that I partly know the instrument That screws me from my true place in your favor, Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still. But this your minion, whom I know you love, And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly, Him will I tear out of that cruel eye Where he sits crowned in his master’s spite. [To VIOLA] Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe inmischief: I’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love To spite a raven’s heart within a dove.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Where goes Cesario?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* After him I love More than I love these eyes, more than my life, More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife. If I do feign, you witnesses above, Punish my life for tainting of my love!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay me, detested! How am I beguiled!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?—Call forth the holy father.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To VIOLA] Come, away!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Whither, my lord?—Cesario, husband, stay.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Husband?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, husband. Can he that deny?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Her husband, sirrah?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, my lord, not I.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety. Fear not, Cesario. Take thy fortunes up. Be that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art As great as that thou fear’st.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, welcome, father! Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence, Here to unfold (though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before ’tis ripe) what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A contract of eternal bond of love, Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands, Attested by the holy close of lips, Strengthened by interchangement of your rings, And all the ceremony of this compact Sealed in my function, by my testimony, Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave I have traveled but two hours.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case? Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow? Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord, I do protest—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* O, do not swear!Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently to SirToby.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* What’s the matter?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he’s the very devil incardinate.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My gentleman, Cesario?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* 'Od’s lifelings, here he is!—You broke my head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to do ’t by Sir Toby.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you. You drew your sword upon me without cause, But I bespoke you fair and hurt you not.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Here comes Sir Toby halting. You shall hear more. But if he had not been in drink, he would have tickled you othergates than he did.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now, gentleman? How is ’t with you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* That’s all one: has hurt me, and there’s the end on ’t. [To FOOL] Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone. His eyes were set at eight i' the morning.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Then he’s a rogue, and a passy-measures pavin. I hate adrunken rogue.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dressed together.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Will you help?—An ass-head, and a coxcomb, and a knave,a thin-faced knave, a gull!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman, But, had it been the brother of my blood, I must have done no less with wit and safety. You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that I do perceive it hath offended you. Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows We made each other but so late ago.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!A natural perspective, that is and is not!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Antonio, O my dear Antonio!How have the hours racked and tortured meSince I have lost thee!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Sebastian are you?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fear’st thou that, Antonio?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How have you made division of yourself? An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Most wonderful!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [looking at VIOLA] Do I stand there? I never had a brother; Nor can there be that deity in my nature, Of here and everywhere. I had a sister, Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured. Of charity, what kin are you to me? What countryman? What name? What parentage?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Of Messaline. Sebastian was my father; Such a Sebastian was my brother too, So went he suited to his watery tomb . If spirits can assume both form and suit You come to fright us.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* A spirit I am indeed, But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate. Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheekAnd say “Thrice-welcome, drownèd Viola!”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My father had a mole upon his brow.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And so had mine.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And died that day when Viola from her birthHad numbered thirteen years.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Oh, that record is lively in my soul! He finished indeed his mortal actThat day that made my sister thirteen years.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* If nothing lets to make us happy both But this my masculine usurped attire, Do not embrace me till each circumstance Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump That I am Viola. Which to confirm, I’ll bring you to a captain in this town, Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count. All the occurrence of my fortune since Hath been between this lady and this lord.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To OLIVIA] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook. But nature to her bias drew in that. You would have been contracted to a maid; Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived. You are betrothed both to a maid and man.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To OLIVIA] Be not amazed. Right noble is his blood. If this be so, as yet the glass seems true, I shall have share in this most happy wreck. [To VIOLA] Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* And all those sayings will I overswear; And those swearings keep as true in soul As doth that orbèd continent the fire That severs day from night.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Give me thy hand,And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid’s garments. He, upon some action, Is now in durance at Malvolio’s suit, A gentleman and follower of my lady’s.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He shall enlarge him.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Fetch Malvolio hither: And yet, alas, now I remember me, They say, poor gentleman, he’s much distract. A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his. (to FOOL) How does he, sirrah?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the staves' end as well as a man in his case may do. Has here writ a letterto you. I should have given ’t you today morning, but as a madman’s epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are delivered.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Open ’t, and read it.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers themadman. [reads] “By the Lord, madam,”—
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* How now? Art thou mad?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* No, madam, I do but read madness. An your ladyship willhave it as it ought to be, you must allow vox.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* So I do, madonna. But to read his right wits is to readthus.Therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [giving the letter to FABIAN] Read it you, sirrah.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [reads] “By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it. Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefitof my senses as well as your Ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or youmuch shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury. The madly used Malvolio.”
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Did he write this?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, madam.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* This savors not much of distraction.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* See him delivered, Fabian; bring him hither.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* My lord so please you, these things further thought on, To think me as well a sister as a wife, One day shall crown the alliance on ’t, so please you, Here at my house and at my proper cost.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer. (to VIOLA) Your master quits you, and for your service done him, So much against the mettle of your sex, So far beneath your soft and tender breeding, And since you called me “master” for so long, Here is my hand. You shall from this time be Your master’s mistress.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To VIOLA] A sister! You are she.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Is this the madman?
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Ay, my lord, this same.How now, Malvolio!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Madam, you have done me wrong,Notorious wrong.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Have I, Malvolio? No.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* (handing a paper) Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter. You must not now deny it is your hand. Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase; Or say ’tis not your seal, not your invention: You can say none of this. Well, grant it then And tell me, in the modesty of honor, Why you have given me such clear lights of favor, Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you, To put on yellow stockings, and to frown Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people? And, acting this in an obedient hope, Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned, Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest, And made the most notorious geck and gull That e'er invention played on? Tell me why.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though, I confess, much like the character. But out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand. And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad, then camest in smiling, And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content. This practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee; But when we know the grounds and authors of it, Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own cause.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Good madam, hear me speak, And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come Taint the condition of this present hour, Which I have wonder’d at. In hope it shall not, Most freely I confess, myself and Toby Set this device against Malvolio here, Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts We had conceived against him. Maria writ The letter at Sir Toby’s great importance, In recompense whereof he hath married her. How with a sportful malice it was followed, May rather pluck on laughter than revenge, If that the injuries be justly weighed That have on both sides passed.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [To MALVOLIO] Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Why, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.” I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir, but that’s all one. [imitates MALVOLIO] “By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.” —But do you remember? “Madam, why laugh you at sucha barren rascal; an you smile not, he’s gagged?” and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He hath been most notoriously abused.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* He hath not told us of the captain yet. When that is known and golden time convents, A solemn combination shall be made Of our dear souls.— Meantime, sweet sister, We will not part from hence. Cesario, come, For so you shall be, while you are a man. But when in other habits you are seen, Orsino’s mistress and his fancy’s queen.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]* [sings] When that I was and a little tiny boy, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, A foolish thing was but a toy, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came to man’s estate, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came, alas! to wive, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, By swaggering could I never thrive, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came unto my beds, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, With toss-pots still had drunken heads, For the rain it raineth every day. A great while ago the world begun, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, But that’s all one, our play is done, And we’ll strive to please you every day.
* [SEQ_SPLITTER]
